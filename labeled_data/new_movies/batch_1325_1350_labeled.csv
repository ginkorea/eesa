0|"the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment .  with she's all that and varsity blues behind us , and several more set for release later in the year , the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance .  however , you wouldn't know it from the quality of the latest entry : jawbreaker .  this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center .  the most popular , and most feared , clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma .  they have accidentally killed one of their own , the "" teen dream "" , liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) , choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday .  now the three surviving girls must decide what to do .  it takes little time at all for the group's leader , courtney ( rose mcgowan ) , to decide to cover it up .  the ditzy marcie ( julie benz ) is game to go along , but the clique's final member , julie ( rebecca gayheart ) , has a guilty conscience .  to make things worse , another student , the hopelessly geeky fern mayo ( judy evans greer ) accidentally discovers the truth .  the girls' cover is surely blown . . .  not so fast .  thinking quickly , courtney offers fern a once-in-a-lifetime chance .  after a quick makeover , fern is transformed into vylette , the beautiful "" new girl "" at school , and a full-fledged member of the popular crowd .  does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder ?  or will this finely honed plan crack over time ?  jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation , and failing miserably , i might add .  it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations , but misses three crucial elements : sharp dialogue , witty characters and the much-needed humor .  it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being ( darkly ) humorous if it wasn't shackled to its dead-weight plot .  the film's most innovative twist is the makeover of fern mayo .  at this point , jawbreaker seems poised to spin wildly into the uncharted depths .  but then , all of a sudden , the innovation stops .  the film becomes mired in the murder-and-cover-up plotting , which quickly saps what little life and energy there was right out of the film .  in the film , rose mcgowan fares the best .  as the manipulative clique leader , she truly dominates every scene she's in ( not a difficult feat in a crowd such as this , however ) .  it's a character crying out for a better movie ( or at least another decently drawn character with which to interact . )  jawbreaker doesn't quite know how to handle its semi-likable characters : fern and julie .  either one could effectively end the movie at any time by simply revealing what she knows .  the lengths to which the film goes to prolong the plot have the unintentional effect of distancing us from these characters .  as their motives become murky and unclear , the film finally falls to the point that it doesn't really matter who wins or loses , since all sides have become equally detestable .   "" detestable "" is a good word to describe the film , jawbreaker .  it's certain that , like the murder weapon described in the film's title , jawbreaker will be triggering more than one gag reflex in the audience .

0|`the bachelor' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see .  wading through this gooey , detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic .  those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere ; `the bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy .  awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money .  although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty-boy cocoon , chris o'donnell has an effortless charm as an actor .  most will recognize him as the high-flying robin from the two latest `batman' films , but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile .  can o'donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders ?  perhaps , if he found the proper vehicle . . .  but `the bachelor' falls far short of the requirements .  the actor just can't register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success .  a few instances of adorable humor aside , it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is `the bachelor' .  o'donnell plays jimmie , a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who's progressing in a serious relationship with anne ( renee zellweger ) .  jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals , and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage .  the problem is that his proposal sucks .  big time .  you can tell things aren't going pleasantly , because jimmie gets the infamous ? deer-in-the-headlights' look when anne questions his approach .  and then , the plot ( along with the stupidity of the movie ) thickens .  jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies suddenly , leaving a video will behind for his grandson ( who also happens to be his only living relative ) .  everybody is speechless when grandpa declares that he is passing down an inheritance in the amount of 100 million dollars to jimmie .  of course , there's a catch : he must get married before his 30th birthday , stay joined with his bride for an entire decade , and produce healthy children within the first five years .  the bad news is that jimmie's birthday is the following day .  with anne out of town , he must find a willing bride to share his riches with . . .  and within a very limited time frame .  there are certainly a few worthwhile aspects of `the bachelor' .  for one , the movie's approach is interesting and not dripping with clich ? .  another is the colorful cast .  o'donnell and zellweger are cute together , and the supporting cast tries relentlessly to rescue the film from drowning in it's own mediocrity .  ustinov is enjoyable as the cranky grandfather figure , and james cromwell is sincere and effective as a wise priest dragged through jimmie's marital adventures .  and now the cons : the approach may be interesting , but in trying an old-fashioned method , director gary sinyor gives the film a synthetic feel .  the characters are drawn with obvious , broad strokes , and the plot is bogged down with everything humanly imaginable .  yes , `the bachelor' is far more frustrating than cute .  the screenplay is lamely written , and the subject matter poorly conceived .  the considerable charm of the two leads is thoughtlessly wasted , along with whatever promise the film initially contained .  potential goes out the window early to suit sinyor's `colorful' approach , but not a minute of this hapless drivel seems accustomed to the director's wishes .  `the bachelor' becomes lost without a homing beacon to save it .  you've seen the tv spots , haven't you ?  o'donnell is madly rushing down a deserted street and the caption reads `what is this man running from ? '  in actuality , he's fleeing from thousands of angry brides who want to marry him and inherit his fortune ( it's one of the few enjoyable sequences in the film ) .  after seeing the movie , i believe that the approaching horde could be something else .  o'donnell could be running from his angry fans , who have just endured `the bachelor' , and are hunting him down for revenge .  |-0.65|0.7666666666666666|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment of the explanations is that the movie is highly negative and receives a scathing review, with criticisms on the screenplay, plot, execution, and wasted potential of the film.

0|"topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil's advocate : movies that have a brilliant beginning but don't know how to end .  it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other .  there is liz , who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment , prue who is getting married , geoff , liz's boyfriend , neil , her previous boyfriend , ant who has written a screenplay .  for the first hour , we get to know these people through everyday activities , as they talk on the phone , go out to dinner , hang clothes on the line .  the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film-makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them .  at times , the events border on the ridiculous , like the screening of the film , but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives .  this doesn't sound like a brilliant premise for a film - "" we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related "" - but it's the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing .  unfortunately this level of honesty isn't maintained .  with about half an hour to go , a sense of impending doom invades topless women talk about their lives and from there is descends into melodrama .  such a disappointment after such a brilliant start .  the actors are all quite good with ms . danielle cormack as liz being particularly impressive .  the energy of her character is palpable and is a major reason the movie is so watchable .  a lot of the performances are a bit rough around the edges but this suits totally the documentary feel of the film .  it seems like these are real people we are watching rather than actors playing roles .  that is why the melodramatic turn of events comes as such a shock .  up till that point , i was transported to this world where these real but mildly insane events were taking place .  while the final half hour is not beyond the realms of possibility , it's unlikely in a way that is jarring to someone caught up in the world of the film .  not just the events , but also the tone of some of the end is wrong , clashing strongly with the sense of fun that has preceded it .  this is not to say that topless women talk about their lives is not a good film .  as stated above , the first hour is superb and even the end is above average .  it just takes a turn which means that an otherwise brilliant movie loses some of its gloss .

0|there is a rule when it comes to movies .  a sequel is never as good as the original .  there are very few exceptions to this rule , and texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation is not one of them .  now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie , and that this isn't even the first sequel to it , you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience .  don't be fooled by the presence of up and coming talents matthew mcconaughey ( a time to kill ) and renee zellweger ( jerry maguire ) .  they made this movie before they were stars .  judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons .  it's a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey .  apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was , because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger .  apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day .  and i don't blame them , they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them .  unfortunately for them it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character .  while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control .

0|as a hot-shot defense attorney , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) has a special talent for picking juries that will ultimately acquit his clients .  he is also an excellent judge of character , knowing just which strings to pull to sway the jury while breaking down a potentially damaging witness's testimony .  and , on top of that , he's a damn good trial lawyer .  in the opening scene , it is obvious that the defendant that he represents is guilty , but it doesn't hamper lomax's desire to creatively squeeze his client through the doors of reasonable doubt , thereby getting an acquittal .  his unblemished record of victories soon captures the attention of one of the most prestigious firms in the country , headed by john milton ( al pacino ) .  he is brought to their headquarters in nyc , where he immediately impresses milton , and is subsequently offered a full-time position as head of their newly-created criminal law division .  lomax is soon given the case of his life .  he must defend a real estate tycoon who has been charged with a triple homicide .  the draw of fame and his desire to prove just how good he really is begins to isolate him in his own hell .  he works late , defends the guilty , pledges his soul to his firm , and begins to neglect his smart but fretful wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) .  but what starts off as a promising john grisham-like story about conscience-stricken lawyers takes an abrupt detour as supernatural forces begin to tinker with the story .  it begins like a typical parable where a small-town boy makes it big , but then has to balance his sense of self against the allure of money , power , and greed .  but milton is far more than just a corrupt partner of the firm .  quite literally , he is the devil in disguise , and as the movie progresses , he reveals some uncanny talents that one could have only if he had sold his soul long ago .  freaky and frightening things begin to happen , and after much of the film has elasped , milton's horrifying intent is finally revealed .  the movie tries to give us two separate and distinct acts .  the first involves the comeuppance of lomax as a big-city trial lawyer .  the second focuses on milton and his ulterior motive for employing lomax .  unfortunately , the two never mix well into a cohesive story , and what we get are two underdeveloped stories that rely too much on one shaky revelation to tie them together and an impressive production piece to give it an underlying atmosphere .  granted , the film is very handsome-looking .  you'll enjoy the final scene where the wall mural seemingly comes to life during a heated speech given by pacino .  you'll also like the images of power and temptation expressed through the fleshy and flashy parties .  you'll also feel the loneliness and insanity that sets in with mary ann , knowing that her husband is slowly drifting away .  this was one of the better storylines , but unfortunately , is only a sub-plot .  as with all thing's involving the devil , you can expect nothing but the worst .  in the first few scenes , reeves anchors the film , but then slowly drifts into the background .  his path from self-vanity to self-consciousness is never fully explored .  his actions seem arbitrary , and his reasons for them not fully known .  pacino's comical portrayal is spirited , but the vanity of his character begins to shift the focus of the movie .  there is another plot or two that is introduced , but never gets revisited .  the focus seemed inconsistent throughout , and the final payoff seemed quick and cheap .  this movie tries to be horrifying , thrilling , and dramatic all at the same time .  however , while the devil's advocate strives to get noticed , ultimately it makes very little impression at all .  |-0.03333333333333335|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|The overall sentiment of the explanations leans towards the negative side, with criticism directed towards the inconsistent and underdeveloped plotlines and the abrupt detour with supernatural elements.

0|"i'm not sure i should be writing a review of the witches of eastwick , because i'm not sure just what the hell ( pardon the expression ) was going on in it .  however , i can express the most important observation i made of it , i . e .  i didn't like it .  if i had to summarize this film , i think i'd conclude it was an updating of one of those old new england folk tales of someone selling their souls to old scratch and how they try to get out of the deal .  that's the kernel of it , anyway .  tossed into this are little bits and pieces that occasionally seem to be saying something about men and women , feminism , the role of the devil , modern reformers , and friendship .  unfortunately , little or no effort is ever made to follow up and elucidate on these concepts ; they're simply thrown out and then left to rot while the film goes on apace .  actually , i think that most of the audience was even more confused than i was .  they came in expecting some kind of supernatural comedy , on the level of ghostbusters , and were a bit confused to be getting a folk tale with philosophical overtones .  they laughed , or tried to laugh , at moments that were either barely funny , or much more horrible than funny , as if that could bend the film away from it's rather frightening direction .  three women ( cher , susan sarandon , and michelle pfieffer ) live in eastwick , a small midwestern town .  one night , while drinking late into the evening , they begin wishing for the ideal man to drop into their lives .  in seeming answer to their idle daydreams , a wealthy eccentric moves into a mansion on the hill and seduces each one by attempting to be everything they want him to be .  he soon shows evidence of mystical--perhaps demonic--power , and his devotion to the women's merest fantasies or wishes has dangerous overtones .  even worse , when ignored his moods become ugly , and he mistreats the women for spurning him .  anyway , the problems : all three female characters are fairly uninteresting , and several are cardboard stereotypes , especially sarandon's character .  we never get inside them , never feel sympathetic to them , because their dialogue and personalities seem pretty bland .  as for nicholson , well , even the devil needs a direction to go in , and while darryl van horne is the most interesting character in the movie ( due to the grace of the screenwriter and , more importantly , nicholson's acting ) , he still can't be yanked in one direction and then another without making him a little vague .  and then there's the special effects .  not in themselves--they weren't that good--but their overuse .  i was almost positive , until i saw the credits , that the witches of eastwick was either produced by alexander salkind ( who has turned out the slop named superman ii and iii and supergirl ) , because of the big name actors in dopy stunts , or stephen spielberg , after the 18th vomit scene and the nicholson-blown-down-the-street stunt .  nope , it's another bunch of guys , and directed by george miller , who has shown great skill with stunts/special effects before ( the road warrior , "" nightmare at 20 , 00 feet "" episode of twilight zone : the movie ) but apparently doesn't know when to turn off the wind machine and let his people act .  f'gawds sake , guys , this is jack nicholson !  let him loose !  let him grin demonically !  skip the splitting earth and fake lightning !  watching the scene where nicholson is tossed out of the car by the voodoo doll , all i could think of was , "" what a waste "" .  if you're going to use slapstick like that , use it up on pee wee herman .  nicholson does what he can with the role , and when he can find his bearings , can be extremely good ( the scene in the church , for instance ) , but most of the time , he seems a bit stiff , as if he's not sure what he should be doing next .  and no wonder .  this script goes all over the map , giving you the feeling that it'd just love to be allegory , but it's not sure about what-- maybe if you give it time it'll think of something .  so what is the witches of eastwick ?  a horror movie ?  a folk tale ?  a comedy ?  a statement about women ?  an examination of the religious right or comparitive morality ?  i tend to think of the image that seems to dominate the movie for me . . . watching  someone regurgitate half-digested bits of food and cherry pits all over rooms , people , the screen , and ultimately , the audience .  in other words , a mess .

0|the most interesting thing about virus is that the title of the film does not refer to the clunky robotic animals that try to kill our heroes .  alas , it refers to our heroes !  as it turns out , the alien race that sends a computer virus to earth ( via the mir space station ) thinks of the human race as a virus -- perhaps even a cancer -- that needs to be eradicated before it spreads any further .  after all , we have taken up this entire planet , and if they let us live for another billion years or so , we might advance beyond our solar system and into the next one .  but the human race doesn't have much to worry about .  after all , there's a woman named foster ( jamie lee curtis ) out there stopping the computer virus .  she's the chief navigator on a sea vessel ; travelling with her is captain everton ( donald sutherland ) , steve baker ( william baldwin ) , woods ( marshall bell ) , squeaky ( julio oscar mechoso ) , and richie ( sherman augustus ) .  they're all sailing in a typhoon one lovely evening when they stumble across an enormous , abandoned russian satellite ship in international waters .  lucky for us , we already saw that the computer virus has taken over the ship and eliminated everyone on board .  the evil captain everton thinks he's going to take the ship in and get a reward ; he convinces his crew that there's going to be big money , so they try to salvage the ship .  soon , however , when it's apparent that no one is on board and that the ship has no power , they realize that something bad must have happened .  finally , they meet nadia ( joanna pacula ) who explains their situation : a computer virus has taken over the ship !  it's creating bio-mechanical life-forms to eliminate the human race !  virus is a truly dumb action thriller , one of negligible intelligence and innovation .  when considering the entire film , you will realize that it lacks a single original scene .  it's a direct rip-off of nearly every james cameron film ( aliens , the abyss , and the terminator films are the most plagiarized ) ; more importantly , it's basically the same movie as last year's deep rising .  i liked deep rising simply because it's funny -- it knows it's silly and derivative .  virus takes itself seriously .  and , in the most serious manner possible , it steals from every good and bad film of the genre , showing you countless familiar scenes , and sporting a cookie-cutter plot that any film of the sci-fi/horror genre could fit with a little trimming .  but what is so amazing about virus is how poorly the whole thing has been thought out .  okay , let me get this straight -- the alien race ( which is never really explained ) is basically sentient electricity .  they need to make themselves physical , so they use a space station to get onto a ship ( which is surrounded by water , but who cares about that ) .  on the ship , they make a bunch of clunky , immobile robots that somehow kill three hundred people .  after that , they start using the dead people to create half-human , half-machine creatures that look like the terminator but are much worse at walking around .  the leader , of course , is a big creature .  every film like this has a big creature at the end , but the big creature in virus is so big that it has to tear down the walls to move around .  virus is indeed a cliched film , but the central flaw lies in the fact that the computer virus just isn't very threatening .  it's established that they can simply turn off the power to stop it , but the virus has sealed the power room by the time our heroes get there .  on one level , virus is almost passable fun .  it's really gory , and a few of the scenes have interesting camp appeal ( the director , john bruno , worked on a lot of cameron's films ) .  there's also a nice array of actors , even though none of them do any acting ( except for donald sutherland , who does a lot of very bad acting ) .  the bottom line , however , is this : virus is a bad movie .  it rips off a lot of good movies that are worth seeing .  in that order , i recommend that you rent any one of the alien films , simply to admire the qualities of a creature that actually threatens our heroes .  |-0.6333333333333333|0.8166666666666668|0.8666666666666667|"The movie ""Virus"" receives a negative sentiment due to its lack of originality, stolen ideas from other films, poorly thought-out plot, bad acting, and portrayal of the computer virus as not being a real threat."
0|"an american werewolf in paris is a failed attempt to recapture the humor and horror of john landis' 1981 feature , an american werewolf in london .  where the original had comedy , the sequel has the kind of revolting silliness that can be found in tv sit-coms .  where the first installment had chills , this one has sequences that are inappropriately , unintentionally funny .  in short , while an american werewolf in london has become something of a minor classic in its genre , the woeful an american werewolf in paris seems destined for late nights on cinemax ( it even has the necessary gratuitous nudity ) .  the film opens with a trio of daredevil americans -- andy ( tom everett scott ) , brad ( vince vieluf ) , and chris ( phil buckman ) -- sneaking up to the top of the eiffel tower to drink wine and do a little bungee jumping .  soon they have company in the person of serafine ( julie delpy ) , who has decided to end it all .  she jumps , but andy , with a bungee cord attached , goes after her , and manages to save her ( at the price of a major headache ) .  serafine disappears , but a smitten andy seeks her out .  however , once he learns his would-be girlfriend's dark secret , he wishes he hadn't .  she's a werewolf , cursed to change into a hideous beast when the moon is full , and , to make matters worse , he has suffered a nasty bite himself .  actress julie delpy is far too good for this movie .  she imbues serafine with spirit , spunk , and humanity , which gives us an emotional stake in the character's fate .  this isn't necessarily a good thing , since it prevents us from relaxing and enjoying an american werewolf in paris as a completely mindless , campy entertainment experience .  delpy's injection of class into an otherwise classless production raises the specter of what this film could have been with a better script and a better cast surrounding her .  delpy's previous credits include such memorable ventures as krzysztof kieslowski's white and richard linklater's before sunrise .  she was radiant , charismatic , and effective in both .  given the nature and level of the material she has to work with here , she gets as close as possible to those adjectives .  it could be argued that delpy is the only reason to see an american werewolf in paris , but even her most devoted fans should consider giving this one a miss .  and if your primary objective is catching a glimpse of her in the buff , check out either killing zoe or the passion of beatrice -- those movies have intelligible plots in addition to breasts .  the rest of the cast acts at a level considerably below that of delpy -- which is to say , they give performances appropriate for the screenplay .  tom everett scott ( that thing you do ) plays the lead like he's in a made-for-tv movie .  it would be kind to call him bland .  actors vince vieluf and phil buckman , as andy's friends , are no more impressive .  julie bowen ( happy gilmore ) is suitably fetching as werewolf meat .  and respected french actor thierry lhermitte has a brief turn as another monster meal .  on the technical side , it's all bad news .  the computer-generated werewolves look painfully unreal .  the creatures would probably have been more believable had they been men in wolf suits .  repeated use is made of the "" werewolf cam "" , an infrared wolf's point-of-view approach that's interesting the first couple of times it's employed , then becomes tedious .  and the soundtrack includes some alternative grunge rock tunes that clash violently with the on-screen action they're matched to .  director anthony waller , who displayed a confident , edgy style in mute witness , stumbles with this material , never being able to make the comedy and horror elements gel .  as a result , we get the worst werewolf sequel since the howling ii : your sister is a werewolf .   ( i will give waller credit for killing off a dog , though -- something that's rarely seen in movies these days . ) an american werewolf in paris is marginally entertaining in a "" bad movie "" sort of way , but that's a dubious distinction .  ultimately , it's an unfortunate effort , for , while it isn't unbearable to sit through , it isn't a howl , either .

0|"depending on who you ask , the original sin was either the eating of the apple , the act of disobedience against god , or the act of betrayal .  but in case you didn't know this , don't bother remembering it . . .  the words "" original sin "" never come up in the movie of the same name , let alone the concept of it .  the closest the film even gets to catholicism is in its narrative ( the story is told by angelina jolie to her priest while on death row in cuba , circa 1900 ) .  regardless of its senseless title , original sin does actually have a plot ( albeit one of the most mangled acts of screenwriting since the art of war , based on the book waltz across darkness ) .  boy ( antionio banderas ) places personal ad sometime around 1900 , searching for a wife .  since this is a century ago , we narrowly dodge a remake of green card , only to find that the girl ( jolie ) faked her photo and is actually beautiful .  skipping a few moderately useless sex scenes ( getting the question out of the way , yes , we get to see angelina jolie's breasts again ) , the girl turns out to be a con artist , swindles boy for his money , and heads for the hills .  original sin then briefly tries to be a thriller .  we see boy go whore-chasing , saying he wants to find girl and kill her .  but as soon as boy actually finds girl , instead of following what might have been a promising ( or at least not completely fucking boring ) thriller , the film degenerates into the worst dissection of the virgin/whore complex since milk money .  girl toys with the idea of reforming her con-girl past , all the while avoiding the "" other man , "" a lover that keeps making her start these scams in the first place .  add insult to injury with some of the worst stylistic choices in cinematic history ( literally half of the film is either in slow motion or uses a strobe effect ) , and acting roughly the caliber of a b . b . gun , and original sin is one of the most torturous films of the summer , definitely front running to make my bottom ten of the year .  don't even bother with original sin , but if you do go , be honest with yourself and admit its pure sex appeal .  just keep in mind that although this film may not be the most original on the block , it's much worse than a sin .  this is sacrilege .

0|"wizards is an animated feature that begins with a narration of epic proportions .  over black and white drawings , we are told that the earth is destroyed in an apocalyptic nuclear exchange , sending the remnants of humanity through generations of radiation-induced mutation .  the "" original "" inhabitants of the earth , fairies and elves , return to populate the globe , along with their evil , mutant counterparts .  one day ( and i say "" one day "" not to be trite , but because that's exactly how it happened - no advance notice ) , a fairy queen gives birth to twins , one good and one evil .  the twins grow up to be powerful wizards , the good one embracing magic , and the bad one utilizing technology to attempt to expand his evil empire .  we are given the notion that an ultimate battle must occur between the forces of magic and those of technology .  as unoriginal as the premise is , i was still somewhat interested in how this story would play itself out .  there's a lot you can do in an animated fantasy world , after all .  i soon learned , however , that the fantasy was the expectation of a decent film .  once the transition was made from still art to color animation , an entirely different feel takes precedence .  rather than the epic saga promised by the narration , we get a goofy-looking world of a saturday morning cartoon .  not just the look , mind you , but all the zany sounds like >honk boing  for years , blackwolf has lost his battles against the magical forces of good , since his armies of ogres and other mutants would get dispirited or distracted soon after battle is joined .  however , blackwolf now has a secret weapon : nazis .  yup , adolf hitler , the luftwaffe and the wehrmacht .  okay , not the real things , but an archival film his minions dug up .  projected into the sky for all to see , it inspires his own army while shocking the enemy into submission long enough for the ogres to hack them up .  before you know it , there are dead elves everywhere .  this is just as well .  the characters are so bad that the viewer doesn't care about any of them .  they're either silly , sappy , or both .  the dialog gets much of the credit for this .  an example is when avatar nonchalantly says , "" well , looks like my brother and i begin our final battle . ""  not very formidable when he's also the guy who says , "" this is the biggest bummer of a trip i've ever been on . ""  my favorite line was from a sideline fairy who is asked by her child why good can't fight back against the nazi-charged evil .  her response is , "" they have weapons and technology .  we just have love . ""  suffice to say , the characters are strictly two-dimensional , and we therefore don't expect anything more than the obvious to happen .  which it does .  the only unexpected occurrence is the way the final battle between brothers is played out , which is anticlimactic and disappointing .  please note that it is the action that is unexpected .  that it is disappointing is not .  the film couldn't settle on a particular mood .  it seems to move from dark to light with the cuts from scene to scene and even angle to angle .  scenes which are seemingly meant to contain deep meaning are ruined by acts of levity .  the dramatics , which seem to occur at random , are overly staged and overly acted , detracting from any kind of value or even enjoyment which could otherwise be gleaned .  ralph bakshi , the director , makes an obvious attempt to get a message across in this film : hitler and the nazis were bad .  so who doesn't know this already ?  well , maybe children .  okay , so you might say that this is a movie for children .  it's not .  in the scenes where good fights evil , there's a lot of violence and gore that children should not be seeing if they're watching a cartoon .  so is the film for adults ?  if so , we probably don't need to be bashed over the head to get the point .  why not have the bad guys be symbolic of the nazis instead of using old propaganda in a seriously disjointed attempt to show us something we already know ?  wizards gives us a lot of footage of nazi tanks and airplanes , and hitler giving speeches .  however , we don't see any reason why they should be considered bad .  we see no atrocities being committed , not even any real battle footage .  there is absolutely no connection made between the armies of evil and the third reich , and we're not even given a cursory explanation as to why this stuff is inspiring in the first place .  this needed to be thought out much more thoroughly if a point were to be made , since subject matter such as this deserves better treatment .  i'd like to assume that bakshi was trying to say that the same nationalist movement that drove the nazis could happen anywhere , at any time , and we must therefore be vigilant .  however , i'm not sure if i want to give him that much credit .

0|movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros . , have never generated much interest at the box office .  but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well .  with a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy .  it got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most' .  and , if you haven't had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video .  in the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity .  the mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth's safety for another generation .  mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition .  despite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth .  outworld's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel .  earth's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld's forces .  it's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie .  it is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story .  this becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more .  they are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act .  this becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana .  the original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best .  they spoke little , but fought a lot .  thus , the movie was easy to digest .  however , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably .  this uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak .  not only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic ( e . g .  useless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom .  try reading this half as fast , and you'll hear what i mean .  but the movie is not a complete fatality .  fight scenes are well-choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility .  and players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo .  even if you're not familiar with the video game , each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves .  but it's just too little of what movie-goers and especially fans of the game will expect .  oddly , the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence .  and the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival .   ( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ) .  rent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only .  |-0.23866666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666666|The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly negative, as they express disappointment with the attempt to add depth and a love story to a video game movie, as well as criticize the poor acting and muddled storyline.

0|"if you don't think kevin kline in drag is funny , wait ? til you see will smith in drag-it's even less funny .  by the time jim west ( smith ) disguised himself as a belly dancer to bail his captured comrade , artemus gordon ( kline ) , from the clutches of evil dr . loveless ( branagh ) , i was unequivocally bored by wild wild west , the new summer blockbuster from men in black director barry sonnenfeld .  is the old west really a breeding ground for high comedy , anyway ?   ( if your answer is no , then you recall rustler's rhapsody or back to the future part iii ; if your answer is yes , you're thinking of blazing saddles , but that movie was a parody of the western genre , not a nineteenth century romp . )  1869 . jim west is a quick-draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon , under orders from president grant ( kline again , whose impression , for all we know , is dead-on ) , to apprehend legless loveless , the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain .  how will loveless accomplish this ?  well , by hulking around the desert in an enormous , mechanical tarantula , of course .  bosomy dance hall girl rita escobar ( hayek ) , whose scientist father was kidnapped by loveless , joins west and gordon on their gadget-filled train .   ( gordon first discovers rita in a cage , waiting to be rescued . )  racial politics obviously prevented the filmmakers from pairing dull rita romantically with west , despite the movie's "" hip "" attitude toward the black thing .   ( west automatically shoots anyone who calls him a "" nigger "" before that person can finish speaking the word .  super . )  at any rate , i kept waiting for rita to say something humourous , but she's a walking dress-up toy .   ( her single comic moment is also the best shot of the film : she bashfully reveals bare bumcheeks through the peek-a-boo flap of her pyjamas . )  jim west is the role that finally stymied will smith , whose comic timing has always been hit or miss , as episodes of "" the fresh prince of bel-air "" demonstrate .  smith's a better reactor than actor , which is why he was so thoroughly engaging in men in black-he didn't start out a hero .  in wild wild west he's required to exude eastwood cool and amuse at the same time ( and from frame one ) , a difficult feat i'm not sure any living performer could pull off .  smith is ill equipped , for example , to handle the moment in which jim west performs stand-up for some rednecks at his own hanging .  what attracted sonnenfeld to this material ?  this isn't the first time he has adapted a tv show for the big screen ( the addams family , anyone ? ) , but it's the first big stinker of his career as a director .  wild wild west is poorly-paced bombast , full of doa gags ( ted levine shows up as a general who uses a gramophone horn for a hearing aid ; levine played buffalo bill in the silence of the lambs-he's too intense to get an intentional laugh ) , lousy special effects ( the bluescreening is amateurish-foregrounds are never proportionate to the backgrounds ) , and frequent illogic .   ( to wit , its ridiculous villain so badly wants jim west out of the way that he . . . drops  him onto a steel platform to do battle with some generic , ugly henchmen , instead of shooting him at point blank rage with one of the many guns on board the tarantula . )  wild wild west's bright spots , such as the cool opening credits sequence , bai ling's all-too-brief appearance as a femme fatale , or the brilliant "" his master's voice "" joke , are all part of the film's first half , which is more clever and enjoyable , at least , than its second .  when , towards what seemed like the end of wild wild west , gordon proposes the idea of building an airplane and west rejects it , there was a collective groan among audience members : it meant we were going to have to sit through another loud action sequence before gordon builds the glider , the invention of which would inevitably lead to the proverbial whiz-bang finale .

0|"the happy bastard's quick movie review  wild wild west  a better name for this movie might've been "" wild wild waste "" .  warner bros . , in an attempt to get their own men in black style of movie , had managed to lasso in some big names ( actor will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , the duo behind mib's success ) in order to get their own fourth of july blockbuster , a contemporary big-screen update to the classic western/sci-fi series the wild wild west starring robert conrad .  but somehow , they ran into a problem along the way .  they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would've made all the difference- a story writer .  wild wild west's story and script was compiled by six different people , rather than just the one who put the brilliant touches on men in black , ed solomon .  if warner bros . had gotten him , the movie would've possibly been five times better than what it is .  heck , ten times .  as is , however , the story and screenplay is a mess , filled with dead laughs , enough racist and sex jokes to make even will cringe as he's performing them , and a complete lack of chemistry that made the tv show work so well .  here's the story : us army member james west ( will smith ) teams up with creative genius artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) to take on a ruthless villain by the name of arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , whose lower half was blown off during the civil war , leaving him to roll around in a steam-controlled wheelchair .  they catch onto a plot of his involving a superweapon that can basically be considered an 80-foot tarantula ( although it looks bigger than that ) , hellbent on destroying anything in its path .  as i said , the way the script unfolds is a complete mess .  but the acting doesn't help either .  kevin kline is miserable as gordon , failing to display even a smidgeon of care as he did in the 1985 western silverado .  smith seems to be having a better time as west , although he's not nearly as charming as he was in mib .  branagh goes excessively over the top as the villain , perhaps to the point where we can't even stand to look at him or his strange beard .  and salma hayek is along for the ride to search for her missing father , but mostly she exists just for sexual attention .  her acting is barely passable , but what a "" breath of fresh ass "" .  director barry sonnenfeld isn't of great help either .  even though he shows some good creativity at some points , his overall urgency for directing is lost .  it's as if he feels he's directing a tv movie , a big no-no when you're helming what's supposed to be a big-screen hit .  last but not least , there are huge gaps of logic that are just plain unacceptable .  at one point , smith defies gravity when first boarding kline's train .  he jumps on the back , gets launched straight up in the air , and somehow manages to land three cars ahead on the train- while it's still in motion !  also , he seems to be strangely comfortable talking about racism in front of a lynch mob , particularly considering the fact that his family was killed by the likes of such folks .  last but not least , why is he still making kissing faces when he knows he's not kissing a woman as he's looking through a peephole at the enemy ? !  the only saving grace for wild wild west come mostly in the form of special effects .  the huge mechanical spider is a technical marvel , very authentic looking and considerable to the creativity of the show .  there's also a good sequence involving metal magnet neckbraces and spinning saw blades , but , again , a logic question comes into play regarding their polarity .  i would say sit back and have a good time with wild wild west , but it really isn't possible .  if the racist and sex jokes don't bother you , the performances will .  if the performances don't bother you , the story will .  if the story doesn't bother you , the racist and sex jokes will .  there's no end to the vicious circle .  go rent men in black instead and pretend smith and tommy lee jones are wearing cowboy hats .  you'll have a better time .  if you do go , keep an eye out for robert conrad in a role as president grant .  i bet he wishes he were somewhere else . . .

0|"old soldiers never die , they just turn into cliches  soldier a film review by michael redman copyright 1998 by michael redman  the warrior and the lover are two personality aspects that find it difficult to exist in the same body .  jungian archetypes , these two opposites need each other to create a whole , but it's difficult to integrate both .  often we'll encounter lovers who think everything is just wonderful and , with the help of jung's magician , sit around imagining grand schemes .  without the drive to manifest their plans , much less the wisdom to recognize the darkness , all they have are dreams .  warriors on the other hand , are ready to go to war at the drop of a hat , and will do combat with every last bit of their energy .  they don't care enough about anything to know what's worth fighting for : gladiators who live only for the battle .  this dichotomy not only describes individuals that we all know , but can also illustrate societies .  america during the late sixties was a conflict between old style cold warriors and the new hippie lovers .  todd 3465 ( kurt russell ) is a living , breathing archetype .  chosen from birth as a soldier , he is raised by the government to be a killing machine .  his childhood is cruelty and competition .  he is indoctrinated with the big rules .  never question authority .  winning is everything .  strength beats knowledge .  a veteran of numerous intergalactic wars , todd is 40 and he's obsolete .  a new generation of genetically engineered soldiers are faster and stronger .  left for dead after a test battle with the best of the new killers , caine 607 ( jason scott lee ) , he's unceremoniously dumped as trash on arcadia 234 , a garbage world .  obviously our hero is still alive .  he finds a group of shipwrecked settlers abandoned on the planet who nurse him back to health .  when the peace-loving colonists get a good look at who todd is , they are afraid of him and he is exiled to live by himself amid the junk on an environmentally hostile world .  they are the other good guys .  these lovers find that they need a warrior when the military coincidentally chooses this world to conduct exercises for their improved human weapons .  todd finds himself in the role of protector .  what could have been a fascinating look at the roles played in our culture and the fears of an ultra-right wing future is ruined by turning the film into a cartoon .  the effects are mostly second-rate explosions or jerky slow motion .  the plot is old hat .  we don't get even a glimpse at the society that created the soldiers .  hardly anything makes sense .  the film's science fares badly .  with all the remarkable advances we've made in just 37 years ( the film takes place in 2036 ) , we're still stupid .  after conquering the stars , for some reason we use vast amounts of energy to load up huge space ships with rubbish tote it to a landfill light years away .  even stranger , the garbage barges appear to double as time machines .  virtually all the trash is vintage 1960 .  there is nothing in the story that is not predictable .  the first thing that todd sees after coming back to life is sandra ( connie nielsen ) , the woman just a little too beautiful to be living in such harsh conditions who is taking care of him .  it doesn't take a genius to foresee that her husband isn't going to be around much longer .  is it a shock to find out that the film's climax is an unarmed battle between todd and caine ?  who would you guess wins ?  some of the scenes would work if this were a comedy .  todd's first awakening of human emotion comes when he glimpses connie's nipple poking through her thin blouse .  later as he sits by his lonely campfire , a tear rolls down his dramatically lighted cheek in slow motion .  supposedly this clich ? isn't meant to be humorous .  dastardly col . mekum ( jason isaacs ) with a pencil-thin mustache is as real as snidley whiplash .  responsible for last year's quirky and visually enticing but problematic "" the fifth element "" , director paul anderson sees the film as "" shane "" in outer space .  maybe , if shane were played by sylvester stallone in rambo mode .  the movie doesn't even work as an action film .  there is never a question as to the outcome .  somehow the new superior soldiers don't prove much of a match for todd .  the acting isn't anything to write home about .  nielsen almost comes across as a real person but is soon relegated to a background victim .  russell is buffed-up and does a credible job but it's not much of a challenge .  uttering around 100 words during the film , mostly what todd does is hit things and stare grimly into space .  gary busey as todd's commanding officer is completely wasted in his low-key role .  everything blows up and occasionally it looks cool .  sometimes the sets are impressive .  unfortunately "" occasionally "" and "" sometimes "" don't make a film .  most disappointing is that the screenplay is by david webb peoples who wrote "" blade runner "" , possibly the best science fiction movie ever made .  sharp-eyed viewers will notice a few obscure references to that film .  peoples says that this is not a "" blade runner "" sequel , but a "" sidequel "" that takes place in the same universe .  although that may have been the intent in his original script , the result is more like a bad television series that the "" blade runner "" replicants watch to pass time .  perhaps those artificial humans would find this entertaining .
