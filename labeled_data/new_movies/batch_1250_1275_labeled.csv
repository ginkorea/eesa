0|"a sensuous romantic comedy , about as appealing as your average lightweight tv sitcom .  there is no special ingredient on the menu for what is dished out , its the kind of stuff i've seen before and was made nauseous by its silly idea of love and what it thinks is funny .  the film plans to exploit the beauty and sweetness of its delicious star pen ? lope cruz , who plays a brazilian chef with a magical touch for bringing out the spices in her preparations , the aromas just sensually waft from her cooking pot , but who can't get by on looks alone in this transparently predictable story .  pen ? lope was wonderful in pedro almod ? var's "" all about my mother , "" but here she is so visible in such a stale story , where she can only smile and tease the audience by having us see a constant barrage of cleavage shots as she bends when cooking , that she somehow looks ridiculous , as if she got egg all over her face .  the best you can say about her , is that she's not to blame for this picture being so off .  this exploitation of sex film without even delivering nudity or sex , is in my opinion , worst than a raunchy film that delivers what it says it will .  the story is all about the love , motion sickness , and cooking ability of isabella ( cruz ) , who is born in bahia , brazil and learns to cook at an early age from her parents' cook .  to cure her motion sickness , her parents tried every remedy , until they went to a spiritualist who prayed to the goddess of the sea for her cure .  she is able to control it now as long as she doesn't drive a car , ride elevators , follow in dancing , and is the woman on top when making love .  in other words , she has to be in control of things .  in her small fishing town she falls in love with a handsome macho latin waiter , toninho oliveira ( murilo ben ? cio ) and marries him .  they open up a successful restaurant , where she slaves away in the kitchen but he gets all the credit for it , even though he's a loafer .  one night she catches him in bed with another girl and decides to leave for san francisco .  we don't see her in flight , so i can't tell how she handled her motion sickness problem -- unless she flew the plane .  she visits her friend's apartment monica ( harold perrineau jr . ) , who is a cross-dresser , blending right into the san francisco scene .  to cast away her love for the irresistible toninho , she calls her spiritualist friend and gets her to cast an irreversible spell , freeing her from ever loving him again .  her luck changes when a local tv producer cliff ( mark feurerstein ) gets a whiff of her cooking and storms into her cooking class as if were in a spell and presents her with her own live tv cooking show .  you can really write the script from here on by yourself . . . as the despondent toninho begins to realize what a good thing he had , but things continue to go bad for him : there is a curse he caused on the fishing in his village , there is no chef to replace his wife , as the restaurant is about to close for good .  so he comes to san francisco , figuring he can charm her again .  he brings along with him his guitar playing musicians , the ones he used when courting her , when he serenaded her under her window .  he sees his wife on tv with monica as her sidekick , the yuppie tv producer chasing after her , and sees that she is no longer charmed by him .  when he sneaks on her tv show set and tries to woo her with his musical group and him singing corny love songs to her , the ratings go up and he's hired as a regular on the show .  the show gets so big , that the network honchos come onboard , taking it national .  but they want to change the ethnic flavor of the show , get rid of monica because he's a freak , have isabella cook with tabasco instead of the brazilian peppers she uses , and they change her ethnic dresses to low-cut vanna white type of sexy dresses .  cliff , her would-be boyfriend , acts creepy and sides with the network big-shots , even though he loved everything she did .  these tv scenes were not only bad stereotype scenes of tv honchos , they were revolting .  it was an insult to one's intelligence .  i'm sure that i'm not spoiling the ending for anyone , when i tell you that toninho reforms his macho ways and together they cook up a meal that breaks her spell of loving him again .  if the film wasn't terrible enough , monica and cliff act on their attraction for each other and become lovers .  it was so awkwardly done , that it had no sense of truth or humor to it .  this film might as well have been made by the same network guys featured in this film , because it doesn't look or feel like an almod ? var film , the type of film it aspired to be , but more like a film that was interferred with from above .  its more like a futile commercial film that is more annoying than charming and more dull than chic , as it searches for box office heaven .

0|"let me just start this review off by saying i am a huge fan of professional wrestling and have been for fifteen years .  i am not too fond of ted turner's world championship wrestling , however , and i am even less fond of it now after seeing this ridiculous excuse for a wrestling movie tonight .  the plot concerns two losers named gordie boggs ( david arquette , aptly cast as a neandrathal ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) who are so obsessed with professional wrestling that they believe everything they see on wcw monday nitro is something more than a flashy show .  when they finally get to see their hero , wcw world champion jimmy king ( played by oliver platt .  i personally would have gotten a wrestler to play king ) , he ends up getting screwed over by evil promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff before he was fired and rehired six months later , and if anyone reads this who knows bischoff , they will agree with me that the role of sinclair had his name written all over it ) , they embark on a quest to find him and help him get his title back .  when they find him , they discover in horror that jimmy king's real life is nothing like it is on wcw tv .  king is a drunken atlanta native rather than an english king .  after convincing king that they don't care that his persona isn't real , gordie and sean sneak him back onto wcw monday nitro , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a main event steel cage match for the wcw title and his job back in las vegas at wcw's pay-per-view .  gee , whiz , there are so many things wrong with this movie , i don't know where to begin .  yes , i do . . .  1 . the characters of gordie and sean show you what eric bischoff , wcw president who thought up this project , thinks of wrestling fans .  he thinks of us as idiots who take everything wrestlers do seriously .  he actually thinks wrestling fans are dumb enough to believe this is meant to be taken seriously .  i got news for you , eric : nobody above the age of four is dumb enough for that , this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 !  i know he'll probably cover arguments up by saying it isn't meant to be taken seriously but it is , because that's how big an ego bischoff has .  2 . there was a documentary made in 1998 , wrestling with shadows , that documented the owner of the world wrestling federation , vince mcmahon's screwing bret "" the hitman "" hart out of the title .  this movie's storyline is basically a comic rip-off of that plot with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in .  eric bischoff is trying to make vince mcmahon look bad with the character of titus sinclair , but any wrestling fan knows titus is more like bischoff than mcmahon , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart .  3 .  the movie's main wrestler , jimmy king , has an english king gimmick and the audience cheered big for him .  no wrestling fan actually enjoys characters like that in this day and age , we want bad asses today !  4 . why make this a comedy , instead of an emotional , rocky-style drama ?  i know wrestling isn't a sport , but you can still get behind a guy who struggles as a wrestler and finally makes it in the end .  5 .  in the movie , gordie starts up an ill-fated romance with nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan .  what she sees in that freak marilyn manson i'll never understand ) , only to find that she has hospitalized king's trainer for sinclair .  wouldn't it have been easier to just have them fall in love instead of doing the typical spy-girl-for-the-bad-guy cliche ?  i hate that .  6 .  last , but certainly not least , there was not one single moment in this movie that i could not predict would happen , nor did i laugh once either .  the world wrestling federation should have been the wrestling company to make the movie , for these reasons :  1 . they're the better promotion .  2 . they have better and younger talent , performers and wrestlers .  3 .  they give their fans what they want and don't treat them like idiots .  4 . they're winning the ratings and they're the promotion everybody cares about .  5 . simply put , they could make a movie a hundred times better , and they could do a wrestling movie the right way .  the only good thing about this movie was they played outtakes at the end .  and if i spoiled it for you , good , i saved you from wasting seven dollars .

0|"battlefield long , boring and just plain stupid  battlefield earth  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  in my mid-teen years , i had a horrendous re-occurring nightmare .  behind the wheel of a car , i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert .  no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway .  no matter what i did , the view didn't change : travelling but not getting anywhere .  each time i awoke in a sweat , terrified .  you don't have to be carl jung to understand that dream .  powerless to make changes , trapped in a boring situation with no hope of rescue , this is the stuff of nightmares whether we are asleep or awake .  this is exactly how you will feel 15 minutes after "" battlefield earth "" begins .  for all of its flash and style , l . ron hubbard's science fiction epic is the earliest and best entry for the dullest summer film of 2000 .  dull "" and "" stupid .  in the year 3000 , the psychlo aliens have ruled our planet for 1 , 000 years .  humans either work as slave labor in mining operations or live as barbarians .  there's no hope .  the future is bleak .  then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry pepper ) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl ( john travolta ) and the alien race .  it's an archetypal post-apocalyptic plot full of promise .  considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen , it's difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably .  but it does .  the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits .  are we really supposed to believe that after a millennium of looking for gold , the psychlo never discovered fort knox ?  or that fighter planes are still in pristine condition after all that time -- and gassed up ?  or that the cavemen become such expert pilots in seven days that they can easily down the advanced alien ships ?  or that the psychlo spy cameras somehow don't notice that their slaves are missing for days ?  travolta prances across the screen hamming it up for all he's worth and is almost entertaining .  almost .  the rest of the actors are wooden mannequins trying not to laugh while delivering lines that no person -- "" man-animal "" or not -- would ever utter .  some of the film _looks_ good , but it also looks so familiar .  a race of large hulking ape-like creatures has taken over the world while our cities lie in ruin .  sound like something charlton heston might be in ?  the psychlo look like overweight klingons in gear from "" dune "" .  the final air battle between the air force fighters and the psychlo ships in their high-tech city is something george lucas might have been associated with .  it's too loud .  it's too oppressive .  it's too slow .  it's too long . . . far  too long .  and on it goes .  the list of the problems with "" battlefield earth "" is endless .  it's difficult to find anything in the film that does work .  oh yeah .  the color scheme is nice .  the real question is how this movie ever got made .  could it have something to do with the fact that l . ron hubbard was the founder of scientology ?  and that john travolta is a member of the church .  that might explain why travolta bought the rights to the novel years ago .  but it doesn't give us a clue as to why first-time screenwriter corey mandell's atrocious script was used .  or why the high-profile project was entrusted with roger christian who had never before directed a major film .  or why no one looked at this thing before it was released and realized there might be problems .  the one bright spot is that no longer will kevin costner's "" the postman "" ( which i begrudgingly admit as a guilty pleasure ) be "" the "" big budget science fiction failure .

0|"even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material , as this subpar submarine comedy proves .  down periscope stars kelsey "" frasier "" grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer's ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy .  like any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who doesn't belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on .  then comes the transparent plotline .  first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard .  after the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who can't connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone .  finally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise .  and he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability .  first they're singing "" louie louie "" like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they're making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off .  the whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) .  it's all predictable without any original humor to redeem it .  the jokes are right out of "" mchale's navy "" and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past .  there's one scene where schneider looks through the ship's pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , "" this expired in 1966 !

0|"synopsis : a humorless police officer's life changes when he befriends a super-smart , super-adorable golden retriever named einstein and a cute , young blond scientist .  unfortunately , einstein shares a psychic link with a bigfoot-sized ape-creature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine , and this rogaine-nightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl .  meanwhile , a group of white , chain-smoking , gun-toting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie .  comments : watchers reborn , a cheaply made direct-to-video turkey , is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz's bestselling novel watchers .  technically , this should have been called watchers v , but it seems that this cycle of horror movies , much like many other sequel-crazy film series , has decided to drop the numbers from the titles .   ( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi . )  the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago .  this really isn't a good movie .  have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation ?  well , any hope a viewer may have had , perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill , will be dashed by the time he's seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn .  they're awful .  these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer , some weird crap about a dead indian , teens , and wolves , and an "" action "" movie called detonator starring scott baio .  scott baio !  what idiot dreamed this movie up ?  after surviving these abysmal trailers , the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented : watchers reborn .   "" maybe it won't be * that * bad "" he may say to himself .   "" perhaps , just perhaps , the bottom-of-the-barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading .  watchers reborn , after all , is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago .  it stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy .  lou rawls is even in the mix ! ""  unfortunately , the force is certainly no longer with mark hamill ( he looks very sick here ) , and this movie shares only basic plot elements with watchers , the book .  the latter is really too bad .  koontz is a hack writer producing way too many thrillers for his own good , but he is still my favorite hack writer .  koontz has a writing style which is succinct and suspenseful .  people who read many of his books , however , often complain of repetitive plot devices .  it's definately not a koontz book if there isn't ( 1 ) a psychic , ( 2 ) a super-intelligent dog , or ( 3 ) a psychotic killer who likes ripping out people's eyeballs .  watchers has all three devices , which may explain why it's arguably the most popular of koontz's books .  the idea behind koontz's novel , though highly implausible , is very interesting .  basically , a biological war machine is created : a smart dog can be released in battle , track down its target , and then relay the target's position , psychically , to a large creature designed to kill in hand-to-hand combat .  silly but kind of neat too .  i'm sorry .  i don't mean to ramble on about matters not directly linked to watchers reborn , the movie .  i suppose i just don't want to talk about the movie itself .  this turkey is really cheesy .  no one in this movie can act , including mark hamill , and it's difficult seeing the aged luke skywalker stumble around trying to be the hero .  the cheese factor is only increased when he's involved in an implied sex scene with the blond biologist / geneticist / zoologist / whatever-the-f * * k-she's-supposed-to-be whom he befriends .  mercifully , the filmmakers opted not to do nudity .  to be honest , the only half-convincing actor in the film is the golden retriever who plays einstein .  you know a movie is bad when a dog outacts all of its human counterparts .  i find it difficult to relate how laughable the action sequences are in this movie .  and the creature !  yes , the creature out after poor einstein is some guy in a furry suit and a mask which poorly imitates the werewolves in the howling .  this creature is shot about 500 , 000 times , but it's okay .  the creature has the ability to kill people by swinging his arms around and pushing .  oh , he can also rip body parts off , allowing for many scenes of fake hands and arms being thrown around .  cheesy gore .  that's another main element of watchers reborn .  it has many bloody scenes which are thoroughly unconvincing and only increase the film's campiness rather than its suspense .  ultimately , i gave watchers reborn a star and a half because bad horror / sci-fi film buffs may get a few kicks out of the film's silliness ( though this film will tax even their patience -- it's an 83 minute film , but it feels like four hours ) .  also , i hate to admit , i have survived far worse than this .  anyone who has sat through the christopher lambert and natasha henstridge debacle known as adrenalin : fear the rush will know what i mean .  finally , i couldn't help but think that watchers reborn would work well as "" bot fodder "" for the creative folks behind one of my all-time favorite shows , "" mystery science theater 3000 . ""  this thought alone helped me survive watchers reborn with a smile on my face .  rated r , watchers reborn contains dozens of blood-spattered bodies and unconvincing gore .  it also has violence , obviously .  i wouldn't recommend it for the little kids , but i'm sure even young teens would make it through this movie okay .  instead of watching this film , however , i recommend reading koontz's book .  trust me , it'll be time much , much better spent .

""   "" and peeing is a big part of my day , just like with felix , "" chuckled another fellow , as he fastened his trousers up around his nipples and prepared to rejoin his wife .  if you're over 60 and in the habit of driving at least 20 miles per hour below the posted speed limit , "" neil simon's the odd couple ii "" may be just the film for you .  others will likely be less charitable .  while "" the odd couple ii "" is amiable enough , neil simon's shockingly lazy screenplay feels like a slapped-together tv reunion show , suffering from wheezing situation comedy set-ups and jokes straight out of the borscht-belt .  simon , once the toast of broadway , has apparently shifted his sights from the great white way to the neighborhood multiplex in branson , missouri .  the contrived story , involving the marriage of their kids , provides the excuse for a reunion between oscar madison and felix unger , who haven't seen each other in 17 years .  the former roommates fly into california from their respective homes for the wedding and , quite literally , run into one another at the airport .  they take off in a rental car for the ceremony in san molina , get lost and have a series of "" wacky "" adventures on the road .  jack lemmon and walter matthau reprise their roles as felix the neat freak and oscar the slob .  while there is an undeniable chemistry between the pair , the impact of their reunion is lessened by the fact that they've headlined three films together since 1993 : "" grumpy old men , "" "" grumpier old men "" and "" out to sea . ""  still , the two veteran actors are fun to watch .  matthau , whose magnificently rumpled face looks like a big pile of laundry with eyes , has a field day as oscar , the crown prince of the curmudgeons .  lemmon , looking pastier than usual , is fine as the ever- annoying felix , who still punctuates his chronic whining with occasional allergic honks of "" phnah !  phnah ! ""  despite their bickering , the characters have real affection for each other , providing a welcome respite from the non-stop barrage of insults that marked their previous three films together .  unfortunately , matthau and lemmon's charm isn't enough to compensate for simon's hack script , which wouldn't pass muster even on a upn sitcom .  one contrived situation follows another , lathered with enough stale one- liners to supply a dozen would-be comics on open-mike night at the local comedy club .  if someone drags you to this film and you find yourself as bored as i was , try entertaining yourself by counting the product placements .  burger king gets one , as does the el pollo loco taco joint , but budget rent-a- car really hits the jackpot .  between script references to their business and shots of signs and stickers bearing their company name , i couldn't keep count of all the plugs .  i did , however , keep track of some of the swearing .  i came up with four "" god-damns , "" three "" shitheads "" and two "" fucks . ""  the inclusion of those particular profanities seemed odd for a film aimed at an older audience , but the theater full of seniors appeared to have no problem with them , howling like crazy every time the boys let rip with a naughty word .  it's sad that a writer of neil simon's stature has grown desperate enough to resort to swearing for cheap laughs , but not surprising when you look at what else gets passed off as humor in this tepid exercise .  one running gag involves oscar and felix's inability to remember the name of the town where the wedding is to be held .  at one point , the men actually spend 30 seconds just free-associating , riffing off variants of the word "" san . ""  the sequence is so creatively bankrupt that it is simply embarrassing .  one of the oldest maxims of film-going is "" beware of movies that use the author's name in the title . ""   "" neil simon's the odd couple ii "" is no exception to the rule .  while the production has enough minor pleasures to warrant a tv viewing on some lazy sunday afternoon , it has no business playing in a movie theater .  of course , there's a bathroom full of old guys who would strongly disagree with every word i've written , and would probably whip my "" young-whippersnapper "" ass to boot .  one thing's for sure , though .  they'll never catch me in a car chase .

0|"the army comedy genre has never turned out a truly good movie ( if you don't count neil simon's biloxi blues ) .  year after year , more predictably cliched military movies come out -- most recently sgt .  bilko -- and none of them ever manage to be anything more than a rehash of the last .  i thought stripes would be different .  with ivan reitman as director , bill murray as star and harold ramis as co-star and co-screenwriter , it seemed like it would be ghostbusters in the army .  instead , it was a bunch of unfunny crap in the army .  murray , about as funny and sophisticated here as he was in meatballs , plays a loser cab driver who sees the army as his only chance for success , and convinces his friend ramis to enlist with him .  so he does , and we get the obligatory drill sergeant from hell , head-shaving and marching/singing sequences , more mind-numbingly stale here than ever .  the characters are even less original , ranging from underachieving slob john candy to incompetent captain john larroquette .  all the big name stars in stripes ( and even larroquette ) fall victim to the lame , rehashed material and are never really likeable , murray in particular .  he only gets a few decent lines in , although those barely-funny one liners pale in comparison to the hilarious peter venkman character he played three years later in ghostbusters .  he was even better in caddyshack , for crying out loud .  as with a lot of the late 70's / early 80's comedies , stripes is a completely juvenile movie only a child would like but is so sex- obsessed no child should be able to watch it .  i'm sure it seems funny on paper to have candy pay over $400 to mud wrestle five beautiful women , but while watching it all that was coming out of my mouth was the admonition "" dear god ! ""  every few seconds .  stripes isn't the playful kind of sex comedy , either .  most of the time it seems downright misogynistic , as when larroquette uses his telescope to peer into the women's showers or murray lifts a female m . p .  onto the stove and , with an i-know-what-you-like look on his face , says he's going to give her the "" aunt jemima treatment , "" which means shoving a spatula under her butt repeatedly .  you don't want to stick around as the scene progresses and he uses an ice cream scoop on her genital region .

0|" "" mercury rising "" has numerous flaws , but there is one that really stands out : its central plot device is unnecessary .  that's right .  the major aspect of the film , that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy / action flicks could be dropped from the beginning , and the movie would turn out exactly the same , if not better .  this central device is the fact that a nine-year-old boy is autistic .  his name is simon , and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it .  simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film , and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent , unfair world against his will , with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him .  the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of "" mercury rising . ""  i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon's character and his relationship with willis , but here it is lost .  miko hughes , the young actor who plays simon , goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic : he walks slowly , drawls his words , kicks and screams when he's touched , and has a hard time looking at other people .  it's a difficult role for an adult , much less a young child , to play , and unfortunately hughes never convinces us that he isn't playing like he's autistic .  unlike dustin hoffman's performance in "" rain man "" or leonardo dicaprio's in "" what's eating gilbert grape , "" we are always painfully aware that hughes is acting .  however , unlike "" rain man "" which used its character's autism in unique and interesting ways to build a credible and touching story , "" mercury rising "" could go right about its generic , predictable plot with simon being simply a really smart but really shy kid .  hell , he doesn't even have to be shy .  in fact , the movie might have been more interesting if he had had a more active role , rather than just being carted around under willis' arm .  willis' character , art jeffries , is a disillusioned fbi agent who has been removed from undercover work and is now doing menial tasks like listening to wiretaps with rookies who are happy to be doing anything .  he becomes involved with simon when he is called to check out a murder scene at simon's house , where his father has apparently shot his mother in the back and then committed suicide .  of course , we know that isn't the way it happened happen because we saw an evil , square-jawed government hitman with a mean-looking crew-cut knock off the parents .  simon was able to get away , and jeffries finds him hiding in a secret compartment in a closet , which the rest of the chicago police department had overlooked .  jeffries -- who is accused by several characters at different times of being paranoid although his actions never suggest it -- knows there is something more , and he makes it his personal mission to go against everything and everyone in order to protect simon .  this is quite a task because that same hitman who knocked off simon's parents is crawling everywhere , attempting to kill simon at the hospital , on the highway , and every other place he goes .  late in the movie , jeffries is forced to enlist the aid of a pretty young woman named stacey ( kim dickens ) who he meets at a coffee shop .  of all the hard-to-believe aspects of the movie , this is the worst .  i can believe in the decency of the human heart , but stacey's character is far too accommodating .  not only does she agree to watch simon while jeffries runs off to solve the mystery , she lets him into her apartment at two o'clock in the morning when she knows the police is after him , and then lets him leave simon in her apartment which means that she has to forgo a business trip that is desperately needed to pay the rent .  the grinding squeals of the rusty plot machine are almost overbearing at this point .  the movie might have been redeemed by some good action sequences , but even here "" mercury rising "" doesn't rise to the challenge .  the movie was directed by harold becker , who has made some good suspense films including "" sea of love "" ( 1989 ) and "" malice "" ( 1993 ) , but his talent is nowhere to be found in this latest excursion .  there is one fight on a streetcar between jeffries and another hitman ( played by peter stormare ) that is so ineptly directed , shot and edited , that i had no idea 1 ) exactly where they were on the streetcar , 2 ) who was hitting who , and 3 ) where this hitman came from and how he knew where jeffries and simon were .  the grand finale takes place on the roof of a tall building , and features a harrowing ( yawn ) scene where simon walks along the very edge of the building , not because he has to , but because it's more suspenseful that way .  taken as a whole , "" mercury rising "" is an tepid , confused movie that lacks style , wit , and any traces of a sense of humor .  usually willis brings his personal brand of understated humor to his roles , but here he is too straight and serious .  this is because the movie wants to be an action flick and a heartfelt drama at the same time , but it ends up failing on both fronts .  maybe the book was better , but the way it's handled here is a perfect case study in formula filmmaking guaranteed to bore .

0|"i have never been a "" star trek "" fan , and , to tell the truth , out of the five films in the series that i have seen ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 9 ) , i have disliked all of them .  i do , however , always go into one of these with an open mind , and the ninth film in the series , "" star trek : insurrection , "" is no exception .  dropping almost completely the hard-core sci-fi element of the previous one in the series , "" first contact , "" "" insurrection , "" tells the story of a planet that holds only 600 people , known as the ba'ku , as well as the fountain of youth .  at the start of the picture , the villagers go under attack by a second alien species , known as the son'a , who want to push all of the ba'ku out so that their own race will not die out .  also attacking the ba'ku is data ( brent spiner ) , a robot from the star trek enterprise .  after returning to jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the gang on their space ship , no one can understand why data was somehow taken over by another force .  so several of the star trek members travel down to the planet of the ba'ku , where picard meets up and starts to fall in love with one of the inhabitants , a sultry , kind alien woman ( donna murphy ) , who is over six-hundred-years-old , but looks to only be in her thirties .   "" star trek : insurrection , "" is a completely unoriginal and cheap-looking installment in the series , and is a big step down from , 1996's "" first contact , "" which at least appeared to try to make something a bit different .  in , "" insurrection , "" however , it plays like a low-rent episode of the television show , due to the small-scale , generic storyline , and an emphasis on one-liners rather than excitement .  the film was filled with nearly non-stop comedy , and worse yet , most of it fell flatter than a cartoon character that drops off a cliff .  meanwhile , when there were action sequences , they were not at all interesting or inventive , relying on that old reliable ticking timer that counts down very , very slowly .  this plot device , which is seen in just about every action film made nowadays , is getting old fast .  are filmmakers so bankrupt of ingenuity and ideas that they must always have a timer ticking away during the climax ?  another element of , "" star trek , "" films in general is that picard seems to always have to have a love interest , but then she always miraculously disappears when the next film is made two or three years later .  although donna murphy , who falls victim to this thankless love interest role here , is actually one of the few characters that we get to know in the 103-minute running time , alfre woodard was far superior in , "" first contact .

0|"while the summer movie season approached its long awaited cessation , we had yet another shoddy , subordinate disposable celluloid superhero movie brought on by the inexorable hasten from the major studios to please kids with everything they think kids will go for to disburse their seven bucks .  and , once again , we have one of the worst films of the year .  the trend of the moment-- and bear in mind it's a trend not a movie - is spawn , and if you've seen the animated series on hbo you'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man , an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment : he's been sent to hell .  todd mcfarlane , the creator of the spawn comic book , must have had a tough time sitting through spawn , for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects , style over substance , ambience over anything else .  not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects , the story , about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of * bad guys * and * find himself * in the process is realized in such a sordid , incapable manner , it becomes indigestible after a while .  every character in this film is lifeless , vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student .  the story begins , like in every superhero movie in this age , with a man living an idyllic life .  al simmons ( michael jai white ) , a government agent/assassin shares the love of his wife , wanda ( theresa russell ) and daughter , has a tongue-in-cheek , wiseass partner , terry ( d . b sweeney ) and is content with the job his boss , jason wynn ( martin sheen ) , provides him .  the next element in the film is the part when things go awry .  and as expected , everyone turns the tables on poor al .  as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant , al is befriended by jason , and dies in a gory and truly sickening scene .  inevitably , it leads everyone to the conclusion that he has passed away .  hence , jason's mischievous master-mind plan , to ` conquer the world "" is just commencing its initial stages , when al makes a pact with satan himself , agreeing to command the devil's army to take over the world and he gets to see his family again .  so , our pal al has been uplifted to hell , and while his transformation from normal guy to spawn takes place , his ol' partner terry forms a relationship with his wife .  time passes .  and now spawn is present in the grotesque inner city , the ghetto where cog ( nicol williamson ) teaches spawn how to utilize his neat artifacts , his motorbike , armor , etc . . .  this character is merely a poor man's obi wan kenobi without all the mythological hoopla .  now the stage is set spawn , the new `enemy of evil' vs evil .  and evil takes the cake , doubtlessly .  john leguizamo's deliciously heinous performance as the injurious clown working for wynn is the film's relief point .  all this anguish , pain , half-baked themes and putrid action scenes are invisible to leguizamo , who steals the show and derives joy from his character , which is basically a compilation of so-so one liners .  and then there's martin sheen .  whichever way you look you will find carving boards near his pitying and downright appalling last two years .  his selections calls for an immediate firing of his agent .  as the megalomaniac boss , his caricature plays like a bad dream out of a b-movie , scrambled , and left in the shelf to rot .  this is the man that starred in films such as apocalypse now and wall street .  i'd never thought i'd be saying this , but at this juncture , charlie sheen's career is in better shape .  spawn is a movie in which realism , or even an attempt to draw a parallel between the problems of the hero and real life is identifiable .  for most of the film the vapid michael jai white consumes his time ogling , jumping through roofs , and performing all kinds of acrobatic exercises which even batman and robin accomplished better .  it constantly reminded us we were watching a superhero movie-- a very bad superhero movie .  continually the film kept on depending on special effects , and sadly , this is how pictures are being made .  perhaps no other movie better than spawn illustrates the deterioration of cinema through computer wizardry .  the filmmakers seem to have forgotten every human element possible .  the quality of this film is abysmal and insulting .  it is perceptible that director mark dippe , attempted to touch the psychological chord that tim burton's batman did touch , the desperation of a man whose life has all but evaporated in one spontaneous act .  but bruce wayne had human elements to him .  he was pensive , resourceful and had relationships , which made our perspective on him equally human .  the character of al simmons seems to be longing for a drastic change , as if he's fatigued about being normal .  and as all superheroes , batman , superman , the phantom , they must possess an element of normal civilians to make us think they are extraordinary .  none of this is present in spawn .  the fighting sequences are weakly executed , the dialogue is penny-dreadful and the art direction an odious duplicate of blade runner's .  as an example of this film's vastly creative imagination the writers of spawn decided to include a poor orphan boy who is abandoned and beaten , and then rescued by spawn , so our emotions tend to be a little more sympathetic .  admittedly , i did laugh once in the film , and that's when todd mcfarlane showed up in an unexpected cameo as a bum .  it is no wonder why so american children grow up with no engrossment for art or literature .  besides blaming a large portion of it on the laughable school system , i condemn the other part to garbage like spawn .  movies that present no admiration , no captivation , no richness and vague interest in what children are being subjected to .  and kids will continue to see films like spawn , simply because they are unable to differentiate what makes an imaginative , wondrous film from an insipid and wasteful one .  children are not muppets .  and spawn unapologetically targets children .

0|i suppose it's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk , which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it's 1991 release .  michael lehmann's action-comedy was quick to win the title `biggest box office flop of all time' , or close thereof .  the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk , who's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation ( `let me put it this way , ' he explains , `i never saw et' ) .  greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime ( played by danny aiello ) , who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes .  these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags , cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences .  it appears as if director lehmann didn't know when to stop all the absurd silliness , and he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness as the movie propels itself toward the finish line .  if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things couldn't get goofier , you'll soon be eating your words .  but , i'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it's box office numbers suggest .  it's fast-paced and entertaining , if you've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor .  for the first portion of this review , i'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk .  wish me luck .  first and foremost : bruce willis is a good sport .  while i'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co-wrote this script , willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big , fat , ugly joke .  he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out-of-place , which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions .  another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character .  they meet when hudson goes on a mission to steal a priceless book from the vatican , and their relationship escalates in interest from there .  it's unfortunate that mcdowell's one-note character is used just as an excuse for there to be a predictable plot-twist , and she offers absolutely no encouraging chemistry with willis .  but now i'm rambling on again about the negative things , aren't i ?  enough of the charade - for the most part , hudson hawk is an excruciating experience .  it's stupid , pointless and repetitive .  i can only wonder what bruce willis fans thought after exiting the theater , because this film really doesn't have the potential to please anyone .  action fans should take note that hudson hawk is composed of 90% comedy , and even the action sequences are skittery , rushed and poorly edited .  and those expecting a hearty laugh or two will find it difficult even to smirk during all of the headache-inducing hi-jinks .  don't get me wrong , this film is not devoid of laughs .  it's too bad most of them are unintentional , or just plain forced .  the impressive cast looks suitably embarrassed .  it's understandable to see willis and aiello in a movie of this caliber , but as for the presence of future academy award winner james coburn i'm not entirely sure .  coburn plays a former nemesis of the hawk who again comes into play , and he looks unsure of his place the entire movie .  especially when he resorts to martial arts during the final showdown , and has a fight with willis that would look right at home in a jackie chan film .  things get more bizarre when we're introduced to his team of rejects named after chocolate bars , including future nypd blue star david caruso as the speechless , card-flipping kit-kat .  if that's not enough for you , there's richard e . grant and sandra bernhard hamming it up as a deranged couple on the brink of a convoluted economic takeover .  their crotch-biting pooch provides a couple of the big laughs here .  wait , maybe the only big laughs . . .  i'm not sure what kind of movie everyone had in mind when filming hudson hawk .  i can't even begin to start about the film's absurd plot ; but let's not get into that .  i suppose there's some amusement viewers could derive from the ridiculous premise , if they were that desperate .  but hudson hawk never even has a clue of where it's going from minute one , and from there it's 90 minutes of pure cinematic muck .  |-0.6666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|0.8000000000000002|Overall, the sentiment of the explanations is negative, as the reviewers criticize the movie for unfunny gags, a ridiculous plot, lack of entertainment value, poor editing, and an embarrassing cast.
0|"if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell's infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era's heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat .  so when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) .  my , how easily does the worm turn .  hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics .  at the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers's last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included .  and with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . .  boring .  although christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_'s lifelessness .  _54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender .  these characters are about as generic as those descriptions .  in focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat .  with the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club's famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow's feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she's a peripheral character at best ) .  as such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ .  what is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ?  even whit stillman's _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn't so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene .  dancing isn't the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher's fault .  from what i've heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54's legend .  but somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film .  aside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane's fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored .  shane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold .  this tacked-on "" romance "" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience .  they fail on both counts .  ultimately , _54_'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n .  as in , there isn't any to be had for the audience .  too much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place .  anyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively .  when anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn't get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film's conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) .  strangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying .  there is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them .  they're on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 .  these two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there's still a great disco movie to be made .  the problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course .

0|"a hotshot lawyer gets an obviously guilty child molester acquitted , and shortly after during the victory celebration gets offered an opportunity to show his prowess in new york city .  the lawyer , kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is not offered a job yet , he is asked to simply pick a jury .  he accepts .  the jury he selects work out well and before long he is offered a job with the firm .  making his decision easy is the fact that not only is he offered big money , but a gorgeous apartment .  he convinces his wife , mary ann ( charlize theron ) to make the move to new york .  the first case given to him is a big test ; a "" winless "" case concerning a man who sacrifices animals in his basement .  the charge was health code violations and kevin once again shows his skill and earns an acquittal .  his new boss and partner in the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) is quite impressed and takes kevin under his wing , explaining many of his philosophies on law , women and sex , and angles the promise of a blissful , wealthy life .  kevin's next case is a dream case , given to him by milton himself ( much to the chagrin to his colleagues ) , defending a triple murder suspect who has had a history of problems with the law .  although kevin's career is taking off , his home life is not doing very well .  mary ann is starting to have numerous problems .  she is experiencing severe depression over kevin's long hours , and before long is having horrible dreams and hallucinations of people turning into ghouls , their faces becoming horribly disfigured .  kevin does not help matters by dismissing his wife .  he does not spend more time with her as he explains to milton that he needs to spend as much time on the case as possible to get it over with , then focus all of his attention on his wife .  not helping matters is the fact that kevin is having ideas about a possible affair with a sexy lawyer ( connie nielson ) also working with the firm .  mary ann falls deeper into her madness as kevin spends more time away from home .  kevin eventually looses control of his life and has to institutionalize his wife , and gets disturbing news from his mother ( judith ivey ) about the mystery concerning the identity of his father .  he also starts to lose control of his case .  kevin learns that all of his problems have been caused by the work of one man .  that man is his boss , mr . milton , a truly evil character who just may be the devil himself .  kevin must somehow confront milton and thwart whatever diabolical plan he has in store .  but how do you defeat the devil ?  why is it that most courtroom scenes in the movies are absurd ?  do filmmakers really believe that "" normal "" courtroom drama doesn't fit the bill and they have to juice them up ?  the courtroom scenes in this movie would never happen in a real courtroom , which wouldn't have been too bad if it weren't keanu reeves trying to pull it off .  i give reeves credit for trying hard , but throughout the movie i never saw the kevin lomax character , just an actor trying very hard to play kevin lomax and coming up short .  charlize theron defines the term "" over-the-top "" in her performance as mary ann lomax , a disappointment in contrast to her good performance in "" 2 days in the valley "" .  the only good performance in the movie is by al pacino , but i kept asking myself what the heck he was doing in this mess ?  maybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him .  it's pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom .  please read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest .  in 1986 i remember watching a movie called "" wisdom "" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do .  what i like to call "" guess what , it was all a dream "" scenario .  in "" wisdom "" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters "" wake up "" from an apparent and say "" gosh , i'm glad that didn't really happen ! "" .  i considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with .  well , the same thing happens in "" the devils advocate "" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn't happen .  i know it's a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that .  of course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one .  as i recall , "" wisdom "" was a decent film .

0|"the spy game is up .  you can thank charlie's angels -- the movie -- for that .  when did banality and pandering become okay ?  just steal from hong kong , the matrix , and a kitschy tv show from the mid-1970s and that's a movie ?  charlie's angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film i've seen in ages .  charlie's angels is dumb .  just plain dumb .  as we all know , three of the hottest females on the planet -- drew barrymore , cameron diaz , and lucy liu -- are three super-agents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie .  they all drive fast cars , look oh-so-fabulous even in the morning , and don't seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men , having buildings explode ten feet in front of them , or flying through the air in matrix slow-motion .  and while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage-busting wetsuits , cleavage-busting waitress uniforms , and cleavage-busting wet t-shirts , they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying , drunk sorority girls , the kind who hit on everybody at a party .  the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer -- the great sam rockwell -- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company .  of course , the rival wants control of his new personal identification system , which involves such latter-day buzzwords as gps , cellular tracking , and even mainframe .  the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels -- like battling each of them in many round-robin matrix rip-off ( again ) fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to sliced-off locks of the angels' hair .  the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley , serving as charlie's manservant , or , more to the point , the angels' pimp .  the rest of the movie comprises a revenge arc , enough costume changes to fill three productions of les miserables , carbon-copy fight sequences that would lend credible evidence to a jackie chan and the wachowski brothers lawsuit for intellectual property theft , and the strange transformation of sam rockwell into mickey rourke's long-lost brother .  charlie's angels starts off with a bang and ends up being a soggy burrito left out overnight .  nothing is difficult , plausible , or believable in any of the angels' actions .  it feels like the matrix , mission : impossible 2 , and cleopatra jones and the casino of gold all rolled into one .  diaz is a knucklehead .  barrymore is the "" dangerous one , "" mean and tough and about as believable as katie holmes in the role .  liu is just . . .  lucy liu , looking good in a skin-tight black leather suit .  the list of movies from which charlie's angels is directly lifted is equally astonishing .  the writers apparently ran the copier all night stealing scenes from armageddon , lethal weapon ii , all of jackie chan's movies , the great escape , saturday night fever , revenge of the nerds , payback , darkman , dr . no , the matrix ( as mentioned ) , and even tv's friends .  it's a shame , too , because one of the many screenwriters , john august , was at the helm of last year's favorite , go .  then again , what can you expect from a director known solely as "" mcg . ""  there is no camp value in the film , no interesting main characters , no invigorating action scenes , no reason at all to waste your time except to ogle the hot chicks and enjoy the performances of a few supporting players .  note to hollywood : next time , let's leave the tv shows on the tv .

0|"i have always been a fan of director neil jordan , from his early work , such as 1984's "" the company of wolves , "" to 1992's "" the crying game , "" and 1994's "" interview with a vampire . ""  his latest film , "" the butcher boy , "" is a return to his roots in ireland , but unfortunately , it is not a successful homecoming .  told through the eyes of a 12-year-old irish boy , francis ( newcomer eomann owens ) , this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life .  his father ( stephen rea ) is an indifferent alcoholic , his mother ( fiona shaw ) is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals , and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore .  francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say , but mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty , and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic , even capable of brutal murder .  the premise of , "" the butcher boy , "" is one that could have very well been turned into a thought-provoking , disturbing motion picture , but somehow nothing works .  francis is in almost every scene , but we learn very little about him , as if the film was distancing itself away from him when , i suspect , we were actually supposed to sympathize with him .  this is definately not young owens fault , however , because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance , and is able to also seem menacing as well .  the fact that we don't get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay .  the supporting characters are no help , though .  rea is wasted , and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son , or to anyone else for that matter .  he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout .  shaw has a little bit more to work with , since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair , but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her .  and singer sinead o'connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice .  the pacing is all off in , "" the butcher boy . ""  although the story could have been dynamite , it moves at a deadeningly slow rate , and i found my mind wandering every once in a while .  it is also very episodic , because the developments in the story fly by with no satisfying payoffs .  at one point , francis is sent away to a juvenile prison , and an odd , possibly sexual relationship begins to develop between a priest and himself , but nothing comes of it .  i'd rather think of , "" the butcher boy , "" as a brief diversion for director jordan , rather than a total misfire .  he has already proven to be a strong director , but he lucked out with this latest film .  what could have been a courageous , unsettling character study of an emotionally disturbed young boy , only manages to be an ineffective , uninvolivng bore .

0|"as you should know , this summer has been less than memorable .  with a total of 4 decent films , it's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing .  with that said , you can pretty much predict what my opinion on "" the 13th warrior "" will be .  the film is based on the michael crichton "" eaters of the dead "" , in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king .  after tarveling for many months , he comes across a gang of norsemen , who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog .  so , they start picking men , and are left without 1 , thus ahmed is choosen .  so far it sounds interesting right ?  not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes .  after that , they basically run around killing .  that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film , because once your story is introduced , you have the rest of the film to start developing it .  obviously that's not the case here .  even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure , you will be disappointed .  since all the action takes place in fog , it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances , and to poor camera work .  can't the camera men sit still ?  i'd like to actually watch a film in focus , but again , they failed to deliver that as well .  the film moves on and on until the point , where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you're eating .  with corny dialogue , that the characters laugh at for some odd reason , a script that goes nowhere , dull action sequences , a predictable ending , and worst of all weak characters , there's basically nothing to like here , except for maybe the set designs .  that's the only thing that honestly caught my interest .  when i heard that john mctiernan , the director , wanted his name kept out of the project , that made me wonder why ?  well now i know .  crichton's greed forced mctiernan to edit his finished product , which led to a big arguement .  what's there to argue about anyway ?  the film couldn't be saved , no matter how much they spent or casted .  seeing films like the haunting and big daddy making money , i wouldn't be surprised to see "" the 13th warrior "" become a hit .  please do me a favor and save your money at all costs , or else you will be lost in the fog , like the film itself .

0|"if i were one of those arrogant critics who thinks his review has some great impact on the success or failure of certain films , i might say that i review movies that don't look particularly good because i'm doing a service to my readers by warning them against seeing it .  if that were true , i could put a banner at the top of my site that reads : "" shay casey : seeing bad movies so you don't have to . ""  but i know that's bunk-you're going to see whatever movies you want to no matter what i say .  so i have to tell the truth : every once in a while i get a nasty , masochistic urge to see a bad movie .  you know the feeling , when you're sick of seeing all these damn academy award contenders and you want to see something you can have a ball trashing mercilessly .  sometimes i think that's why anyone goes to see pauly shore movies , ever .  admit it : sometimes you like seeing bad movies .  so do i .  so i saw "" supernova . ""  truth be told , "" supernova "" wasn't quite as bad as i thought it might be .  maybe i just felt sorry for the actors , or maybe i thought it could have been decent if the studio hadn't started tinkering with the director's ( walter hill ) final cut , causing him to want his name removed .  maybe i'm becoming a softy .  in any case , i didn't find "" supernova "" as bad as the advance buzz would have me believe .  but it's still bad .  the film takes place aboard the medical space vessel "" nightingale . ""  the crew includes captain a . j .  marley ( robert forster ) , his new second officer nick vanzant ( james spader ) , head medical officer kaela evers ( angela bassett ) , medical technicians yerzy penalosa ( lou diamond phillips ) and danika lund ( robin tunney ) , and computer technician benj sotomejor ( wilson cruz ) .  there are some attempts at "" characterization , "" but all that means is that nick has a shady past involving a drug addiction , which puts kaela on edge , yerzy and danika have a relationship that requires them to make kissy-faces at each other every five minutes , and benj ( apparently gay ) is in love with the computer ( apparently female ) .  don't expect any more explanation , because you won't get it .  anyway , the crew gets a distress call from a location deep in space to which a failed mining operation had been sent .  during the dimension jump ( i think that's what it's called , but don't hold me to it ) , the captain is killed and the man who sent the distress signal ( peter facinelli ) is brought on board .  he calls himself troy larson , making him the supposed son of a man kaela once had a relationship with .  then a bunch of really predictable stuff starts happening .  have you seen "" alien ? ""  have you seen "" event horizon "" ( a lame movie in its own right ) ?  good .  then you've seen "" supernova . ""  post-production cuts or not , there is nothing original about this screenplay , and nothing unpredictable either .  after all , no one's going to think for a second that troy won't turn out to be a villain .  but the bigger problem with "" supernova "" is that it can' t just stick to the simple plot it's afforded .  numerous re-writes ( the script may be credited to three people , but it's a gross underestimate ) have crammed this lean 90-minute film with tons of extraneous plot threads that all remain underdeveloped .  was there something about a limping robot shaped like a fighter pilot ?  did the ship's computer learn something about humanity ?  what was that glowing lava lamp artifact troy brought on board with him ?  and just what does the film's title signify , if anything ?  as far as i can tell , it refers to a very small plot detail that isn't developed , just like the rest of these unnecessary story elements .  character relationships in this film also make very little sense .  for some reason , every person in this film keeps having sex .  we get an unusually early sex scene between phillips and tunney within the first 10 minutes .  bassett and spader's characters start off hating each other .  fifteen minutes and one bottle of pear brandy later , they're engaging in some hanky-panky .  when troy the creepy stranger shows up on the ship , of course both female crew members will fall in love with him .  every single shift in character interaction happens extremely suddenly , which is only one of the many obvious clues to how much this film has been cut .  the most prominent example , however , may be the fact that when the film starts , there are no opening credits !  furthermore , the end of the film looks like they took what were originally intended to be the opening credits and spliced them in right before the real end credits .  maybe that's why the film's title is mentioned twice during the end credits , right between james spader and robert forster .  right after you get over the shock of not being told what movie you're seeing ( lest you decide to walk out upon making that discovery ) , you might notice that the movie seems to have dropped you right in the middle of a scene , with little-to-no introduction to any of the characters or situations .  the rest of the movie feels like they skipped over the middle stuff in the character changes ( you know , where they explain things ) and just went from point a to point b . point a : danika is thoroughly enamored of yerzy and is ready to have his baby .  point b : tunney is now shagging troy and yerzy is unusually obsessed with the lava lamp thing .  doesn't make sense .  since i didn't understand anything about these characters' motivations , did i care when troy abruptly starts murdering them one-by-one ( and he does , knocking off three of them in about 10 minutes ) ?  not a whit .  it's a shame , because this cast contains a lot of talented actors looking for something to do .  they don't find it .  bassett and spader say every line in the same monotone voice with the same blank expressions on their faces .  sexual tension ?  more like constipation .  maybe they're just embarrassed at having to utter such howlers as "" this thing was made by someone more powerful than god and a whole lot less nice . ""  not that we ever find out who that is , mind you .  the climax of their relationship ( taking place in a transport pod ) is probably the film's biggest forehead-slapper .  as troy , peter facinelli inhabits the most obvious villain in history that no one ever suspected .  he' s awfully one-note , but it's not as if he's given any more notes to work with .  the rest of the cast does even less .  tunney stands around looking cute , then scared .  phillips broods .  cruz flirts with the computer .  then they all die and a star blows up or something , but i really wasn't paying much attention by then .   "" supernova "" is pretty awful , but i'm cutting it a little slack merely because i expected less than what i got .  that's it .  if you expect it to be good ( for whatever reasons you may have ) , you'll probably hate it more than i will .  even the special effects are fairly unimpressive , nothing you haven' t seen before , and suffice to say the script isn't going to save the film .  honestly , though , what do you expect from a film with about a dozen writers and a director who had his name removed and replaced with a pseudonym ?  it usually results in a bad movie , and that's what "" supernova "" is .

0|"for timing reasons having to do with baby sitters , we recently went to a multiplex and saw undercover blues .  i would give it one half of a star for guts .  anyone in a movie this bad would have to have guts .  i later read a ny times review that said kathleen turner and dennis quaid had gotten so plump they looked like they had the mumps in the show .  the script was the worst part .  they had characters who talked with funny accents in an attempt to make you laugh .  they had lots of "" great "" sight gags like two people trying to go in a door together and therefore bumping shoulders against the door .  turner and quaid both kept smiling like some idiots on a game show .  the good news is that we were smart enough to vote with our feet and left .  buy some tickets and give them to your worst enemies .  tell them the show is great and smile a lot .   * * * * = one of the top few films of this or any year .  a must see film .   * * * = excellent show .  look for it .   * * = average movie .  kind of enjoyable .   * = poor show .  don't waste your money .  0 = one of the worst films of this or any year .  totally unbearable .  review written on : september 29 , 1993  opinions expressed are mine and not meant to reflect my employer's .

0|"the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits .  the rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that's exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is .  last year's speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year's species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory .  in some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer .  whatever uniqueness the original might've had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller .  julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion .  julie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) .  will and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics .  unfortunately , things aren't so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook .  it's another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending .  there's not much that's original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it's unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel .  for die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer .  the aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn't heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing .  the man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments .  much of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point .  the whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem .  and , whereas the killer's identity might've been a question in the first movie , it's almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically .  three or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as "" the killer . ""  they're almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show .  and so , in the end , it's left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast .  god help us .

0|i'm a dedicated fan of writer kevin williamson's work .  he always finds a clever way to spice up old material with witty dialogue and fresh ideas that stem from his inventive brain .  with teaching mrs . tingle , his directorial debut , williamson has reached the end of his rope .  what used to be intelligent about his films is hopelessly stale here .  the components are all there , including an encouraging premise that all high school students can relate to .  but where are the thrills ?  the laughs ?  both are supposedly absent from this draggy exercise in elaborate revenge .  and what a shame that is .  i loved the scream films - heck , i even enjoyed the sci-fi goofiness of the faculty .  kevin williamson was the reason horror films were such a big draw at the box office .  teaching mrs . tingle , a black comedy that will leave a gaping void in his optimistic followers , may put an end to his reign .  or perhaps it will encourage him to spend more time perfecting a script than to worry about his directing duties .  i still have my faith , but i fear the name of kevin williamson may soon be a forgotten echo of the past .  the title character of his pet project is a vicious , uncaring history teacher who is played deliciously over-the-top by british actress helen mirren .  mrs . tingle is basically every student's worst nightmare : a heartless human being bent on distributing poor marks to even the most hard-working of her pupils .  the principal ( michael mckean ) is horrified of her , and she is unanimously despised among her fellow staff members .  i enjoyed the fact that everyone in the hallway quickly steers out of her way .  mirren's performance is one of the very few delights in this distressingly hollow black comedy that goes down like a flat soft drink .  in other words , it's a poor substitute for williamson's best work .  the plot is a big problem here .  material that could have been enjoyable is rendered totally ridiculous by poor handling on the part of the director .  the likable katie holmes plays leigh ann , an over-achiever hoping to get a college scholarship .  but typical mrs . tingle says her history project , which she worked on for countless hours , is laughable .  later on while studying in the gymnasium , a classmate ( barry watson ) offers her a photo-copied duplicate of mrs . tingle's final exam .  leigh ann's best friend ( marisa coughlan ) encourages her to use it .  alas , the old hag herself finds the three scheming , and snatches the test , and prepares to talk to the principal in the morning .  in the morning . . .  how convenient !  the three students head to mrs . tingle's house , attempting to set the facts straight and clear leigh ann's name .  things get out of hand , and the teacher gets knocked unconscious in a tussle .  the plan is to tie her to a bed and try to get some reasoning out of her .  of course , not everything goes entirely to plan .  besides pointless sub-plots involving the football coach ( jeffrey tambor , horribly wasted ) , there is little by way of actual progress .  there is no urgency to the situation ; little tension or laughs are involved .  the humor is completely inconsistent .  after many of the jokes , the theater was so silent i could have heard a fly sneeze .  you continue to await some momentum in the story , something that could possibly revive the slow pace .  a moment like that never arises .  williamson also does a handsome job of wasting some of the key supporting players , including the talented mckean and larry sanders' vet tambor .  and the beautiful vivica a . fox has one lifeless scene as a caring guidance counselor , and then williamson disposes of her character entirely .  on the plus side , holmes and coughlan are admirable ( with the latter giving a frighteningly believable exorcism impression ) , and molly ringwald has an amusing cameo appearance as a substitute teacher .  while everything is pretty lifeless , teaching mrs . tingle remains watchable .  there are a few promising ideas that pop up now and again , but anything remotely interesting is squandered by the inane script .  mirren is easily the best reason to keep watching .  she is convincingly evil and fun to watch , but even her gifted delivery can't save individual scenes that flounder in boredom .  if there is one word for the movie surrounding her , it would be `disappointing' .  basically , kevin williamson is his worst enemy here .  his uneventful direction prevents any aspects of his screenplay to be appreciated ( not that his writing here is especially good ) .  we will see , when rookie screenwriter ehren kruger writes the third installment in the scream franchise this christmas , whether williamson is for real .  |-0.06899999999999999|0.8333333333333334|0.9|"The sentiment in the text is mostly negative, with phrases indicating dissatisfaction with the movie, despite a positive mention of Helen Mirren's performance, ultimately not outweighing the overall negative tone.

0|"a film that means well , but is too pushy in promoting its belabored point and too sentimental to be compelling as a drama .  it's jeroen krabb ? 's melodrama about a community of jews in antwerp in 1972 who can't forget their bitter past .  the heroine is an attractive , carefree , nonreligious 20-year-old , chaja ( fraser ) , who wants to forget her jewish roots by getting involved in student demonstrations , screwing a student rebel leader , and living with her gentile friends away from her nagging mother ( s ? gebrecht ) and her self-absorbed , eccentric father ( schell ) .  her parents are survivors of the holocaust concentration camps , and her home life is filled with angst .  her mother is in denial about the past always busying herself by cooking soup and baking cakes and complaining about everything , while her father is more openly loving but has recently been absorbed in searching for two suitcases filled with mementos , a family album , silverware , and his old violin .  he buried them in a garden during the war while fleeing the nazis , but can't locate them now due to all the changes in the city .  out of frustration after quitting her job as a dishwasher and facing eviction from her apartment , she reluctantly accepts a job as a nanny with an hasidic couple that an old man in her parents' apartment building , mr . apfelschnitt ( topol ) , tells her about .  the hasidics are ultra-orthodox : they don't go to the cinema or watch tv , adhere to strict dress codes , and strictly observe their religious laws .  chaja is at first put off by the way they expect her to follow their rules , but soon finds the wife , mrs . kalman ( rossellini ) , to be kind and she becomes attached to one of her 5 children , a 4-year-old named simcha ( monty ) who doesn't talk .  the stern mr . kalman ( krabb ? ) is not friendly to her and considers her to be a whore because of the way she dresses .  to hammer home the point of how anti-semitism hasn't gone away there's a barrage of overdone and uninvolving scenes with a sneering concierge ( bradley ) , who keeps making nasty remarks about jews and tries to make things inconvenient for them by preventing the jewish family from using the elevator .  the film is done in by its ham-fisted script as the story , adapted from carl friedman's book "" the shovel and the loom , "" goes from one false note to another until it gets lost in all the goo of its sentimentality .  it starts off telling chaja's story of how she's a lost jewess trying to find her identity , then to her nanny role as she loves a mute child stuck in an insulated environment , and then it makes it a story about the lingering effects of the bitter past that can't be forgotten .  the effort seemed heavy-handed , as the film kept delivering too many obvious messages that it ponderously kept delivering through the stock characters .  the supporting cast consists of all wooden characters who give their roles a cartoonish flavoring : chaja's parents are given no human shades , while the janitor villain was a particularly annoying role that was one-dimensional and falsely acted .  the only ones who fought through the script and showed some feelings were fraser , whose effervescent face was expressive of both the trying times she was going through and the joys she felt -- but most admirably showing how she could be so mistaken as to think that she could forget her roots ; while rossellini gave a warm performance of a woman suffering in silence , but is strong in accepting her faith .  topol's reassuring performance as the wise man who says all the right things to fraser , acts as the true voice of the filmmaker in explaining all the sufferings with common sense .  the film brazenly uses little simcha to get across its agenda of pointing out how the patriarchal world can be cruel when it can't love : it starts out by showing how under chaja's loving care he's taken to the duck pond and soon starts jabbering away , beginning by saying 'quack , quack' and then going on to ask the four questions during a passover seder .  but by showing how the boy is so terrified of his strict father that he wets his pants in his presence , refuses to speak because of his stern dad , and eventually becomes the victim of a tragic accident , the film thereby exploits the boy's sufferings and his story just becomes tiresome and not sincerely done .  i felt i didn't just see a movie , but i attended a lecture for the whole 100 minutes of this serious but unappetizing story .  it was the kind of movie that you hoped would somehow end soon , as it seemed to be in the habit of rehashing its same viewpoint unnecessarily--the message it keeps sending was already received .  in the last shot where father and daughter are hopelessly digging for the lost luggage , one has the impression that no one in the film learned anything about themselves or the past .  that seems strange , since i thought that was what this film was supposed to be about .  unless i was mistaken and the film's real aim was to make us cry over simcha .

0|"the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad "" .  so i didn't expect too much from this .  but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre .  i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont .  i thought , mabe it will be fun ?  and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing .  but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? .  these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality .  here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation .  among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) .  actually , the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens .  but he gets unexpected help from the house itself .  it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights .  portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs .  a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth .  filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains .  but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen .  the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture .  is that exciting or what ?  the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad .  it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson .  a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent .  it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience .   "" the blair witch project "" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses .  and with a $70 mill .  budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror .  de bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening .  he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush .  but why give him a more serious material ?  in the end "" haunting "" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director .  yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad .  the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky .  but this is where the good things end .  the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life .  it's nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage .  at first you do not know what's going on .  is this part of the experiment ?  are these hallucinations ?  projections of the subconscience ?  paranoia ?  but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening .  the house is actually possessed .  it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window .  for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that's what i got ?  i believe hichock once said that "" it's better to wait for a climax , than to see one "" .  this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid .  they are impossible to take seriously .  any paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick's "" the shining "" , are absolutely baseless .   "" shining "" had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality .   "" haunting "" has only special effects and art direction to boast of .  and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film .  casting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse .  but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : "" some films are just born stupid "" .
