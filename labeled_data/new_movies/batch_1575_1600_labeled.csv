""  his pathetic life is souring as he can no longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes of fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish .  jimmy has his own family crisis as his drug-addict daughter ( melora walters , boogie nights ) refuses to have anything to do with him for reasons which are not disclosed to us until the end of the film .  grabbing at one last attempt at happiness she reaches out to a softhearted cop ( john c . reilly , never been kissed ) even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection .  this dysfunctional group carries on for what seems to be an interminable two-thirds of the movie .  and then it gets worse , literally raining frogs .  yes , frogs .  assuming it to be an intended deus-ex-machina device , it is an ineffective one because it doesn't seem to faze the characters much .  oh , they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets , but otherwise , the frog shower didn't seem to change their behavior or pattern of living ( or dying ) .  there is simply too much going on in this movie and most of it is distasteful to watch .  mr . anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue , a character who apparently rapped a significant clue to a plot development which was completely unintelligble , and a heavy handed segment of "" historical "" occurances containing ironic twists which set up absolutely nothing .  one of the recurring themes is found in a line donnie quotes : "" we may be done with the past , but the past is not done with us . ""  this is an absolute lie .  god is in the forgiveness business .  in fact , as we humbly ask for forgiveness and repent or change our offending mindset , god's word says that he not only forgives , he also forgets .

""  isaiah 43 : 25 [kjv]  the spiritual one who keeps bringing up our unrighteous past is the same one who wants to keep us in a state of condemnation .  don't let him .  next time your spiritual adversary reminds you of your past , take great pleasure in reminding him of his future .  he hates that .

0|"so much for sweet returns .  after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80's slasher movies , starting with 1996's "" scream , "" and followed by "" scream 2 , "" "" urban legend , "" and the original , "" i know what you did last summer , "" a film like , "" i still know what you did last summer , "" was bound to be made sooner or late .  it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out , and that is because they reached for the lowest-common-denominator in filmmaking , favoring non-stop deaths and gore for suspense , and trading in fleshed out , likable characters for one-dimensional nitwits .  it has been exactly one year since julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis , a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road , and then , thinking he was dead , dumped him into the ocean .  since then , julie has relocated to boston university , and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams , she has been able to put her life back together .  when julie's friend , karla ( brandy ) , is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is , she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people , which also includes karla's horny boyfriend , tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , and will ( matthew settle ) , who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend , ray ( freddie prinze jr . , also returning from the original ) , doesn't show up .  when they reach the secluded island , they discover it is the last day of the open season , and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them .  of course , julie , her friends , and the workers aren't the only ones there , as the murderous ben willis , dressed in fisherman garb , returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all .  it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like , "" i still know what you did last summer , "" is made .  i am a very big fan of horror movies , and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to "" ikwydls , "" which i am a fan of , is almost an exact replica of a "" friday the 13th "" movie .  while the original focused more on the story and characters , as well as genuinely suspenseful moments , thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson ( who didn't return to write the sequel , and it shows ) , "" i still know . . . ""  has no story to speak of , and is so vacuous of ideas , that the filmmakers , were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested .  also gone are any signs of character development , and since every single character died before i got to know them , all i was left with was to stare at the screen , indifferent to what was going on .  while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original , it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died .  they were all paper-thin and pointless , except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman .  another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set-pieces , like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar , but there are none to speak of in this sequel ( although they do come close at one moment with brandy ) .  since so many people were killed every couple minutes , the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water .  also of note is the mystery of the second killer , and accomplice to ben , but it is obvious from the first frame who it is , and so i couldn't even have fun at that , like i did in the "" scream "" movies and , "" urban legend . ""  it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again , a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else .  maybe the people who made , "" i still know what you did last summer , "" should have realized that in order to make a good movie , you must have a screenplay---or at least one that isn't such a black hole for thoughts and ideas .  the ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part , but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel , everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead .

0|once upon a time jean-claude van damme was a decent action hero .  the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films , boasting his spectacular martial-arts ability .  some of these excursions were fun .  but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore , with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind-numbing action .  and when the action goes sour , what is there left to enjoy ?  i'll explain .  knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong .  marcus ray ( van damme ) , a babe-magnet and stylish dresser , heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner ( rob schneider ) .  they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans , seemingly by a mole in the business .  i'm going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph , so if you want a review devoid of spoilers , skip onto the next one .  i'm not quite sure who gives a crap , but i'll issue a warning anyhow .  tommy is really working with the cia .  his boss ( a very hammy and flat paul sorvino ) is the mole , and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons .  he even stoops so low to put them into children's toys .  if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing , then you probably will enjoy knock off .  if you think that this ridiculous set-up couldn't even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing , this might not be your cup of tea .  knock off sucks .  it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares .  it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something , simply because van damme is the star .  the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind , the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe , and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe .  director tsui hark ( who teamed with van damme in the superior , but still lame-brained double team ) is at the helm , and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot .  i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work , but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous .  the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence , speeds are altered consistently , and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired .  it all sounds very cool .  trust me , it isn't .  as much as it scars me to say this ( har , har ) , van damme is terrible .  sure , he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease .  he looks like he's doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan , and his performance is stiff and tired .  i hate to say it , but perhaps it's time for mr . van damme to give up his day job .  it's really a test of endurance watching knock off .  i suppose there's some enjoyment derived from schneider's character , who is extremely annoying , but provides the film's better moments .  and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie ?  hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter .  knock off doesn't even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film , like a handful of van damme's others .  no , this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking .  and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department , that is certainly not saying much .  note to self : avoid universal soldier 2 : the return upon release in august ? 99 .  |-0.8166666666666668|0.9|0.8000000000000002|The explanations all convey a highly negative sentiment towards Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies, criticizing them as mindless, painful, and an embarrassment to the action genre, particularly mentioning the negative aspects of the plot, performances, and camera work.

( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st . bernard for eve to care for . )  the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eve's events where georgia is the keynote speaker .  there's a superficial resemblance to shakespeare's "" king lear "" ( senile king with three daughters : one devoted saint and two selfish bitches ) , but the material is apparently drawn from life .  sister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team .  henry and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays , including "" desk set "" and "" there's no business like show business . ""   ( delia's novel , the basis for the film , is dedicated to henry ) .  surprisingly , the script is as thin as an anorexic's wet dream .  the virtue of a semi-autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available .  yet , the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters .  also , the spaces they inhabit seem artificial .  eve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout ; no matter how put-upon she is , we can't feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day .  georgia is a famous magazine editor , and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile .  when we first meet maddy , she's fishing at a picturesque mountain stream .  i expected to see the credit "" cinematography by 'vanity fair . ' ""  and , yes , diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrow's mother .  to her credit , though , she looks young enough to pull it off .  the one redeeming aspect of "" hanging up "" is that , at its core , is a truth about siblings .  there's always one on which everyone else in the family relies , freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant .  my wife is the reliable child in her family ; for better or worse , my brother has the role in mine .   ( being selfish and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling , but it is a lot less work ) .  if you have nothing better to do than watch this movie , look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters' mother pat .  in a devastating scene , eve discovers that her mother doesn't love her .  although leachman is best known for comedies like "" young frankenstein "" and "" the mary tyler moore show , "" her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in "" the last picture show . ""  bottom line : everyone involved has lived in hollywood so long they don't recognize real life anymore .

0|"this is the worst movie i've seen since the "" so bad i walked out on it "" "" jingle all the way "" .  it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap .  it is crap through and through .  nothing works in this film , as to be expected from joel schumacher , who has made only one watchable film in his entire career ( that being "" cousins "" ) .  here's a man who admits he's a medicore director , a rather charmingly self-effacing statement .  but truth be told , he is much worse than mediocre .  not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though -- akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again .  there is no plot anywhere , and the "" dialogue "" is unrelentingly shallow , preposterous , and boring .  they set up mr . freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife , then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one-liners .  it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death .  but that's par for course -- nothing in this film makes any sense , including half of arnold schwarzenegger's lines .  as mr . freeze , arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once .  this is the same problem he had in "" jingle all the way "" , and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass .  personally , i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn't retake scenes to make him understandable .  compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in "" batman & robin "" .  apparently , james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold .  uma thurman is not as bad , but nothing resembling good either .  her poison ivy vamps around terribly , chewing up scenery left and right .  and her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub-snl standard "" acting "" , as if she's reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment .  given the "" script "" , it's a wonder it didn't happen more frequently .  there is no redeeming feature in this film -- not george clooney as batman , chris o'donnell as robin , nor alicia silverstone as batgirl .  michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred , as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance .  in fact , there was something unsettling about his appearance , which seems to have been accomplished without any make-up tricks , looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man .  unfortunately , every scene about alfred's sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance -- they just go through the motions , losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart .  the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle -- you know there's a bunch of people , but instead of a melee , schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist .  there's never a moment of awe , wonder , or mayhem .  the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects , which are impressive ( and probably expensive ) .  even then , the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable .  the hockey team from hell ?  not even the tv series got that stupid ( at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that "" batman & robin "" showcases ) .  frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do .  blink , and you'll miss elle macpherson as julie madison , vivica fox as a "" why is she even in the film "" vamp in freeze's lair ( with all of two lines ) , and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had .  and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs , vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs . fries -- she isn't even filmed well enough to look good ( trust me , she's quite attractive outside of this dreck ) .  and as if the film weren't bad enough to limp along with bad direction , bad dialogue , bad performances , and bad fight scenes , there are inconsistencies and illogic galore .  i know it's nit-picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs , why the character's arms aren't ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one-armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet ( while holding on to another person no less ) , or where the moisture comes from when freeze's weapon creates tons if ice .  that's all traditional comic book stuff .  but why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by-standers ?  why is there a big switch clearly marked , "" heat "" in mr . freeze's lair ?  why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr . freeze hand to hand ?  why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her ?  why do batman & robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency ?  and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones , why don't they wear masks to filter it out ?  i could go on and on .   "" batman & robin "" is a braindead , pointless , garish , loud film that should still reign as the "" worst film of the year "" by the time 1998 rolls along .  note to warner bros . -- if you're going to make another batman film , please replace schumacher with nearly anyone .  because it could actually get worse than this .  what schumacher does not understand is that "" comic book "" doesn't automatically equal unbearable idiocy .  the true equation seems to be schumacher + batman = unbearable idiocy .

0|"when i ponder childhood memories past , one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the "" inspector gadget "" tv show with my older brother .  truth be told , we were rabid fanatics ; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune , alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr . claw , the inspector's arch nemesis .  i was never a biggie on nostalgia , but you just can't help but have fond memories of something like that .  sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re-runs of my favorite episodes , trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid .  at the very least , i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me .  despite how horrid a film may be , the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up .  so back i sat , with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver ( let's face it ; exactly how good can a live-action disney film really be ? ) .  i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr . magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations ) , and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well .  rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness .  as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind , i was left sitting there , absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen .  can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world ?  right from the beginning , i knew i was in trouble .  in the opening scenes , each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be , to simply serve as real-life duplicates of their cartoon clones .  when referring to them , people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be ( "" oh , hi penny !  is brain with you ? "" ) .  creating one-dimensional replicas is one thing ; having mere names take the place of them is quite another .  the "" plot "" , shall we call it , stays fairly in tune with the original series .  matthew broderick stars as john brown ( how creative is that ? ) ,  a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex ( why , rupert everett , for the love of god why ? ? ? ! ! ! ) , who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events .  brown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new law-enforcement technology wherein he's joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form ( drumroll , please ) . . .  inspector gadget !  >from here on out , the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations ( although , to be fair , my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind ) .  there's something about an evil gadget taking over the city ( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon's dentures from there's something about mary ) and it all ends with ( what else ? ) a bunch of post-credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself .  to be honest , i wasn't much paying attention to these "" treats "" .  i was just glad that it was over .

( the audience will easily identify with allen's sentiments . )  with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles , the movie engenders little genuine laughter .  the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it .  the plot for the movie involves two starving actors , maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci ) , who accidentally end up on a cruise ship .  in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina ) , who is chasing them , they dress up as ship's stewards .  the over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer .  when the leads hide from their pursuers , arthur covers maurice's mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze .  at other times , we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else , while darting in and out of staterooms .  with the film's chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage , it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce .  the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having .  too bad they weren't more concerned with the audience's potential enjoyment .  the jokes , frequently framed in silence , fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground .  one wonders if anyone ever viewed the film's dailies .  surely , if they had , they would have realized what leaden results they were producing .  it is tricky having good actors play bad ones , but , if they couldn't pull it off , they should have just given up .

0|"if you're debating whether or not to see _breakfast_of_champions_ , ask yourself one simple question : do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie ?  the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolph's chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight .  everyone else--and i'm hoping that's most people--would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess .  actually , though , the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle , which focuses dwayne hoover ( bruce willis ) , the owner of dwayne hoover's exit 11 motor village in midland city .  not only is he a huge success as a businessman , he's also something of a celebrity , his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials .  with a nice home and family to boot , dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy--yet he's not .  his wife celia ( barbara hershey ) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze ; his son george ( lukas haas ) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name "" bunny . ""  not only that , the environmental protection agency is on dwayne's ass over a building development project .  it's enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown--that is , if he doesn't succeed in blowing his brains out first .  meanwhile , midland city is about to host a fine arts festival , and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout ( albert finney ) , a writer who is far from the renowned author the festival's organizer ( buck henry ) was led to believe--in fact , he's a penniless hack who writes second-rate sci-fi that appears in porn magazines .  his trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey , one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne , who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of life's answers .  the above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews , but , ironically , i have barely scratched the surface .  i haven't yet mentioned wayne hoobler ( omar epps ) , an ex-con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly-named dwayne .  then there's the matter of francine ( glenne headly ) , dwayne's devoted secretary .  not to mention dwayne's employee and old friend harry lesabre ( nolte ) , the one with the secret penchant for cross-dressing .  and so on .  the film is essentially dwayne's story , but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is .  rudolph does arrive at a point ( more on that later ) , but it's blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material .  the surreal visual style , complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwayne's ears , is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness , but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad .  the actors are called on to act accordingly , resulting in some of the worst , most overdone work all of them have ever turned in .  willis fares best of all--but that's because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience .  with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time , it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious , and rudolph tries to make a statement .  unlike _american_beauty_ ( a film that _breakfast_ resembles in more than a few ways , to its great detriment ) , there isn't any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift .  as such , the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned ; and the film attempts , to no avail , to reach a profundity that it doesn't deserve .  vonnegut's original novel is considered a classic , but it had been called unfilmable--the same that was said of hunter s . thompson's _fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas_ , which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam .  with the similar failure of _breakfast_of_champions_ , will hollywood ever learn that books labeled "" unfilmable "" inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable ?  likely not .

0|suicide is pointless , everyone should know that .  so what's this movie like ?  you guessed it . . .  pointless .  the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters , from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them .  when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide , it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever .  that's what the press materials for the film probably say .  now here's what i say : the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time .  boring , arty , pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as . . .  well as committing suicide .  the movie lost me early on , immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window .  the girl's father ( james woods ) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on .  then , as the scene ends , the lawn sprinklers come on .  is that a joke ?  is that supposed to be amusing in some way ?  from then on , the movie failed to draw me back in .  performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides .  woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen , but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well .  dunst has the potential to be a big star , if she chooses her projects well .  and while this film is awful , she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed .  there are also a few cameos in the film here and there , which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more .  as a result , they all seem rather pointless ( although there's a brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since . . .  well since eddie and the cruisers ) .  perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters .  we never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what they're feeling .  all we really know is that mrs . lisbon ( kathleen turner ) is strict and keeps them on a short leash .  what mother doesn't ?  it's certainly no reason to commit suicide .  with the godfather part iii , sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera .  with the virgin suicides , she proves she has no business behind it either .  having family connections doesn't entitle you to be allowed to make movies .  so attention film directors . . .  stop letting your daughters pout their way into the industry .  just because they share your dna doesn't mean they share your talent .

0|"the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities .  the best tales of the genre deal with mankind's struggle for survival or knowledge .  such popular and noteworthy tomes as "" stranger in a strange land "" by robert heinlein , "" childhood's end "" by arthur c . clarke and "" man in the high castle "" and "" do androids dream of electric sheep "" by philip k . dick all deal with man's need for identity and struggle for self worth .  hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it's beginnings .  most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved .  it really wasn't until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein's novel "" rocketship galileo "" and crafted the film "" destination moon "" , that 'sci-fi' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it's own .  from there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre .  with the release of touchstone pictures "" mission to mars "" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe .  the film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission .  woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son .  entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) .  luc consoles jim with woody's assistance .  the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them .  but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet .  the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars .  they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface .  going out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed 'face on mars' .  a strange noise emanates from the rock .  as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc .  back on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing .  luc's interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team .  the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger .  meteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet's surface .  the big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars .  and if so , what is its relationship with us ?  now for the bad news .  the entire plot of "" mission to mars "" is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe .  the famed 'face on mars' becomes the centerpiece of the film , revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed .  borrowing ideas from such films as "" robinson crusoe on mars "" ( 1964 ) , quatermass and the pit ( 1967 ) , "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" , and even mario bava's "" planet of the vampires "" ( 'terrore nello spazio' ) ( 1965 ) , "" mission to mars "" is a hodgepodge of ideas that don't add up to a satisfying whole .  while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed , the film remains flat and un-involving .  so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film , but to no good use .  the performances are all workmen like , with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry .  gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation .  and the mistaken idea of having jerry o'connell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse .  and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better .  he's just having too much fun here to give a damn .  the script has a few lapses , namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower , no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage .  this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship .  also , when one character sacrifices himself , the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation .  but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid , intrusive score by ennio morricone .  subtlety is non-existent here .  in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out .  the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower .  the pacing of the film is very leisurely .  after the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes ) , we are finally dropped onto the martian surface .  then , there is another long pause in the plot for more character development , including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity .  the film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum .  there are so many scenes of talking heads , discussing what we already know is going to happen , that it drags the film to a dead stop .  the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at .  the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring .  the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted , with a level of realism that hasn't been seen since "" 2001 : a space odyssey "" .  the visual effects are just stunning , from the space walk sequences , to the visualization of evolution on earth .  the only fault come with the martians themselves , which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world .  director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film .  the opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage' to hitchcock's "" rope "" ) , as we are introduced to all of the characters .  scenes in the rescue ship , with its rotating centrifuge , are just amazing in their execution .  but the nagging question , is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang .  sadly it is not .  director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production .  the set design and visual effects are all arresting .  but it's the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous , thought provoking science fiction .  a disappointing film , but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals .

0|"back in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention , new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big-screen update of the cult 1960s sci-fi tv show lost in space , complete with in-person appearances by cast members mimi rogers , matt leblanc , lacey chabert , jack johnson , and even gary oldman .  that should have set off my warning alarms--the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago , when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in-person cameo to peddle . . .  last action hero .  but no , like millions of others , i bought into the hype and "" got lost . ""  if only i had gotten lost--literally--on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped-together blockbuster wannabe .  you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film .  at the convention , goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series , and if that really is the case , i'd hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in .  to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with--which there most certainly is not .  after the setup , in which the robinson family--father john ( william hurt , looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews ) , mother maureen ( rogers , wasted ) , daughters judy ( heather graham , ditto ) and penny ( a heavily made-up chabert , looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things ) , and son will ( young newcomer johnson , making the best of it ) --and pilot don west ( leblanc , doing a bad han solo impression ) find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr . smith ( a watered-down but still-lively oldman , cashing a paycheck and loving every minute ) , the script's "" stream "" of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along--and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting .  they encounter another ship .  they board it .  alien spiders attack them .  they return to their ship .  the other one explodes .  they land on a deserted planet .  and so on .  an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act , but goldsman doesn't seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device ; when one character's past self dies , the future incarnation inexplicably lives on .  the look and effects should be lost in space's ace-in-the-hole , but hopkins even manages to botch that .  for a big-budget film , the visual effects are incredibly shoddy .  in one composite background shot , i could see the blue outline around oldman ; the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like . . .  digital effects .  but nothing in those shots is as jaw-droppingly unconvincing as blawp , a monkey-like space creature that becomes penny's pet .  entirely computer-generated and every inch showing it , blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game .  apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it ; how else can one explain the graininess of blawp's composite shots with the human actors ?  but in doing so , the seams are that much more obvious .  you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystal-clear solo reaction shot of judy .  new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long-running star trek cash cow at paramount .  i don't think so .  in a few years , the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question : what film ended titanic's 15-week reign at the top of the weekend box office ?

0|the working title for no looking back was long time , nothing new , and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture .  even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes , it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics .  writer/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline , the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasn't spent their life in seclusion .  instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings , burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion , offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way .  no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful .  the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide , and the sooner , the better .  alas , that's not the case , and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio .  and , to further depress audiences , burns has shot the entire film on cold , rainy days in a gray new york state beach town .  peeks of sunshine are few and far between .  no wonder the characters are all so miserable .  first of all , we have charlie ( burns ) , a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion , then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home .  that girlfriend is claudia ( lauren holly ) , and , after picking up the pieces of her life following charlie's departure , she has moved on , shacking up with one of charlie's old school buddies , mike ( jon bon jovi ) .  the two have a comfortable relationship , but it's apparent to even a blind person that they're not right for each other .  claudia years for some spice in her life ; mike wants to settle down and have children .  then charlie re-enters the mix .  so who , if anyone , will claudia end up with ?  who cares ? ?  no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that we're not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle .  so what if no one finds happiness -- these characters don't deserve it anyway , especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time .  they aren't real people -- they're a writer's construct stumbling through a too-obvious storyline .  they should know the ending as well as we do .  and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two .  another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially-interesting supporting characters .  blythe danner is solid as claudia's housebound mother , connie britton is suitably high-strung as claudia's neurotic sister , and jennifer esposito is eye-catching as a bartender in search of a little romance .  sadly , all we get is quick glimpses into their lives , although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell .  none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes .  edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here .  jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career , but he could still use a little polish .  the worst case is lauren holly , who presents a completely bland claudia .  as portrayed here , she's hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moment's interest , not to mention undying love .  burns' ex , the monumentally untalented maxine bahns , would have been hard-pressed to do a less inspired job .  when he released the brothers mcmullen , edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival ( robert redford has apparently stuck with him -- the aging actor/director executive produced this mess ) .  two films and three short years later , the luster has faded .  some movie makers have only one good film in them .  with back- to-back duds like she's the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers , burns is beginning to look like a member of that undistinguished club .  |-0.8300000000000001|0.8833333333333333|0.8333333333333334|The explanations all indicate a negative sentiment towards the movie, with common criticisms including a hackneyed storyline, predictable conclusion, unlikable characters, and a waste of time.
0|"the job of the film critic is to see a movie and write a review of it that tells you what it's about and why it's good or bad .  i feel kind of embarrassed to admit this , but i after having seen "" get carter "" i really can't tell you what it's about although i could go on and on about how and why it's a bad movie .   "" get carter "" falls into that category of ? movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room .  you might call them the "" steven seagal/mickey rourke/jean-claude van damme/wesley snipes school of mediocre action/crime thrillers . ""  you know - the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights , shoot-outs and car chases but really light on plot and character development .  they have stories where the so-called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight , chase or shoot at .  sylvester stallone stars as jack carter , a las vegas-based mob enforcer who returns home * for his brother's funeral .  he believes his brother ? richie was "" taken out "" and didn't die from a dwi accident .  carter's one of the most cliche bad-asses ever captured on celluloid .  his face alone is pretty intimidating and there's quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his "" rambo-on-testosterone-therapy "" voice .  stallone's performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesn't realize he's mocking himself .  the actual story involves carter's investigation into his brother richie's death .  he's in a town that's not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well .  mickey rourke co-stars as one of these characters , a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon ( played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman ) .  there's also another plot involving richie's mistress , a secret cd-rom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carter's still-living relatives .  i'm rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible .  i could just rip the screenplay to shreds , plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all .  i don't like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally .  yes , "" get carter "" is just that complicated and complex .  and what's worse is that it's not this intricate to make it seem smart like "" the usual suspects "" for example - just the opposite .  you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didn't remember what had already happened and didn't figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax .  all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another , asking them what they know , getting information and then realizing that if he wasn't a complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes .  although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another .  making a movie entirely about criminals doesn't necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters .  mel gibson starred in "" payback "" a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldn't help but like him even though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter .  so ultimately "" get carter "" fails for pretty much every selling point it has .  carter is not a likable character and you really don't care if he gets revenge or not .  the action sequences are not at all exciting or original .  the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all ( c'mon , you know who's going to win every brawl and shoot-out and car chase ) .  in the end you don't feel nearly satisfied with the results .  the filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible .   * the city is never mentioned by name but i assume it's seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and it's always raining .

0|i've got to admit it . . .  i'm a huge jim carrey fan .  i loved the first ace ventura , as well as the mask and dumb and dumber--and even in batman forever ( which was a pretty awful movie ) , carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good .  until i saw ace ventura 2 , i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying .  sadly , ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be .  carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie , but this time it is no longer funny--it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i .  the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon ( in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof ) .  soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and , if not returned in four days , will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other .  once again , it's up to ace to save the day , using his uncanny detective skills .  those who have been disappointed by carrey's more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over-acting to the best of his ability , but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesn't capture the feel of the original .  the original benefited from what looked to be carrey's constant hyped-up improv sequences , which were hysterically funny .  here , however , the tighter script ( which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies ) takes the improvised material from the first , and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie , giving carrey little chance to improvise .  instead , his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly .  but one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself .  in the first movie , he was always cool , and one step ahead of every one else--perfect for carrey's off-the-wall approach .  but here , ventura is made to look a lot stupider , and is often made out as the straight guy--a role which is definitely not carrey's style .  there are definitely some very funny moments , but they are few and far between .  they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura , or even dumb and dumber .  |-0.6666666666666666|0.9|0.9|"The explanations express disappointment and negative sentiment towards Jim Carrey's performance in ""Ace Ventura 2,"" criticizing the lack of humor and improv sequences that made the first movie enjoyable, and stating that the portrayal of the protagonist is not in line with Carrey's usual style."
0|"for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them .  sadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver .  and not a particularly good one at that .  what went wrong ?  mi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it'll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise's firing gun just so they can die really cool .  early on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic .  in one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other's eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff .  prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another .  why ?  i haven't the foggiest .  i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply .  with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects .  it's possible that these "" spies "" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored .  the scenes i've described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character .  god forbid .  woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals .  still in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish .  cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) .  between the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact .  the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us .  sure it's all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product .  thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that's about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight .  they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres .  newton bats her eyes flirtatiously .  cruise grins a little too slyly .  the cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film .  here cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 .  he's cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90's ) .  sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise's initial "" i'm the man ! ""  charm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug .  mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won't stop .  the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could've been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the "" symbolic "" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) .  we've all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand .  it isn't done any differently here .  the action is pure hard target \ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind .  he's cool for sure but he's made to be as empty as the movie .  the actor isn't used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one .  when he's not beaming away , he's staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo's editing seriously undermines the effort .  he fetishizes cruise's angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof .  i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he's really austin powers .  in a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death .  the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) .  the lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles .  though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a "" so you thought i was dead . . . "" .  not to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat .  what a hero !  you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2's plot .  my reasoning is simple : i'm not sure of any good it would do .  the film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next "" special "" effect .  i wasn't kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video .  nobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they'll surely regret it .  as summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing .  in mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma's ( that film's director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo's non-stop masturbatory pandemonium .  it's irrelevant in every sense , as is character .  all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors .

( mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city . )  anyway , tarzan's old jungle friend appears to him in a vision .  tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city .  he leaves jane ( his first mistake , in my opinion ) and travels to africa .  of course , jane is hot on her ape man's heals .  the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys .  sound like a dumb explanation of the plot ?  it's actually an improvement over the real thing .  the acting is just plain awful .  i'm not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film , but it wasn't acting .  jane march wasn't a heck of a lot better , but at least she is easy on the eyes .  compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re-recorded , and i've seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies .  added to the sound problems was the cinematography .  this film was filled with beautiful african scenery .  but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me .  quite frankly , i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment .  then we have the special effects .
