0|" "" what is this , a homicide or a bad b-movie ? ""  that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie .  let me clear things up for you cupcake , this isn't a bad b-movie , it's a really bad b-movie .  so bad , it's almost good .  almost , but not quite .  the movie starts off in the 1950's with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth .  it is a bunch of slug-like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies .  the slugs' first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody .  that is , until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986 .  he , and the slugs inside him , promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co-eds into slug zombies .  a slightly crazed cop ( tom atkins ) and the requisite girl with the face of an angel ( jill whitlow ) join these two geeky university students ( jason lively and steve marshall ) to do battle with the slugs .  it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs .  the acting is bad with a capital b . the story is worse .  and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie .  the only saving grace was the requisite tit-shot courtesy of jill whitlow .  it had absolutely nothing to do with the story -- but i liked it .  actually , it was the high point of the movie for me .  of course , that isn't really saying much .  the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion .  which gives it a leg up on some other horror films .  unlike most movies of this genre , there actually is a story .  not a great one , but it is there .  this is one in a long line of movies from the 1980's that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th , halloween and nightmare on elm street movies .  you could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better .  but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b-movie horror marathon .  just don't be too upset if you can't find it .  you really won't be missing that much .

0|"there's a scene early on in "" jawbreaker "" where a character utters the unintentionally prophetic line , "" that is * so * not funny "" .  how right she was .  this pathetic tale of three high-schoolers who accidentally kill their best friend in a birthday kidnapping prank gone horribly awry is never even remotely funny .  or fun .  or original .  not content with the too-obvious "" heathers "" heisting , the filmmakers proceed to lift freely from a staggering variety of sources , including "" carrie "" , "" bride of frankenstein "" , "" blue velvet "" , and even shaw's pygmalion , itself recently remade as "" she's all that "" .   "" jawbreaker "" is a pastiche , and not even an enjoyable one .  i find it extremely telling that the most engaging part of the film is the credit sequence , a jawbreaker factory montage inexplicably backed by veruca salt's "" volcano girls "" ; serving as a blueprint for the rest of the film , the song has absolutely nothing to do with the footage we're watching .  just close your eyes and pretend you're listening to an alt-rock station ; you won't be missing anything .  the blame for a mess this big has to be spread around among the principals .  rebecca gayheart , following roles in "" scream 2 "" and "" urban legend "" , should have known better than to take yet another role in yet another teen body count movie .  pam grier has totally wasted any credibility she might have gotten from her role in quentin tarantino's "" jackie brown "" .  and rose mcgowan should just quit acting .  she has no charisma , no presence , and no acting skills other than rolling her eyes and looking disaffected .  mcgowan manages to be upstaged by her real-life boyfriend , rocker marilyn manson , whose fifteen second role here is far more interesting than anything any of the "" real "" actors are doing .  manson , sans trademark makeup & contact lenses , and with an obviously fake moustache , looks eerily like nicholas cage ; who woulda thunk it ?  that crack about direction by committee wasn't merely a pithy sound-bite .  stylistically , thematically & narratively , "" jawbreaker "" is all over the map , varying wildly in tone & content from scene to scene .  though credited solely to writer/director darren stein , one gets the feeling that no two scenes here were actually guided by the same hands .  if stein was indeed responsible for the whole of this atrocity , someone needs to get the man some drugs , pronto .  prozac , lithium , kava , ritalin , something , anything .  he's quite obviously in desperate need of chemical help .

0|"can you say "" dated "" ?  you can if you've seen rosemary's baby which , like the exorcist , was a thrilling horror film in its time but seems boring and laughable in the decades that have passed since its original release .   "" mystery science theater 3000 "" has skewered the bad films of the past , but let me tell you , it could do a number on the "" good "" ones too .  rosemary's baby stars mia farrow ( from the time she was actually good-looking ) as an innocent housewife and her not-so-innocent husband ( john cassavettes ) , an actor who takes an easy , albeit evil , road to success .  it all seems so harmless in the beginning .  mia and john move into an apartment where several past murders have been committed .

0|" "" the 44 caliber killer has struck again . ""  starring john leguizamo , mira sorvino , adrian brody , jennifer esposito , michael rispoli , bebe neuwirth .  rated r .  summer of sam will be remembered as a waste of spike lee's abilities .  lee is a great filmmaker , often exhibiting kinetic visual flair on par with brian depalma and martin scorsese and a storytelling ability comparable to steven spielberg .  but here , he gets himself into a bind .  his latest effort is a case of a director pretending he has something to say when in reality there is little of substance to absorb from his work .  the summer of 1977 was an unusual summer in new york city .  it was the hottest summer on record .  to boot , new york's first serial killer was on the loose : calling himself the son of sam , david berkowitz killed 9 people in the new york area and frightened the whole city population .  so it was understandable that when nyc was hit with a citywide blackout , people went berserk , causing billions of dollars in damage to the city .  the movie's focus is on a group of twenty-somethings during that fateful summer : vinny ( john leguizamo ) , a club-hopping , adultrous hairdresser , his benevolent wife dionna ( mira sorvino , looking young ) , ritchie ( adrian brody ) , a punk who becomes an outcast as well as a son of sam suspect , a gang of small time mobsters and a few more minor characters .  we follow them through their roller coaster lives , thrown out of whack even more by the recent killings .  vinny and dionna have marital problems because vinny cheats and dionna tries to please him , make him stay faithful to her .  ritchie gets shunned by his group of friends because he has started to become more and more "" eccentric , "" and has degenerated to the point of dancing in gay night clubs and making porno films with his girlfriend .  tensions build and conflicts arise as the anniversary night of son of sam's first murder looms ; the night he promises he will strike again .  a local gang with too much time on its hands makes a list detailing all of the people that its members think might be suspects .  at the top of the list is ritchie .  vinny , an unwilling part of the said group , is called upon to set a trap for his friend .  as we watch these proceedings , some of which are painfully graphic , the dreaded "" so what ? ""  question springs to mind .  from the way this movie is made , i'd have guessed that spike lee was trying to tell us something , but as i searched deeper it became clear that there is very little there to find .  lee touches on so much -- the media , the 70's punk scene , the details of the actual killings , as well as the characters' very personal dilemmas -- but he doesn't bring all of his topics together to form a coherent theme or make a discernible statement .  all is not lost if a movie turns out to be hollow ; it can be a saving grace for the film to be enjoyable .  too bad summer of sam doesn't get any help here .  frankly , it's a bore , a redundant and repetitive two hour and twenty minute film that doesn't entertain beyond its first half hour .  there is no suspense because the film refuses to be fully about the murders and little involving drama because the film is too muddled and its focus too vague .  leguizamo's turn as vinnie is annoying and whiny .  the script makes it clear that we're supposed to believe that his character is flawed , but still a good guy .  you'd never guess from his performance .  adrian brody and especially mira sorvino fare better .  sorvino gives a riveting , touching performance in a banal movie ( i'm tempted to think that i liked her because nearly everything else around her was inane ) ; her character is affecting and her emotions true-to-heart .  brody , too paints an effective portrait of a young guy desperate for attention who gets a little more than he bargained for .  summer of sam has some superficial elements of a good film : it looks great , it has a few notable performances and i suppose it's pretty well directed , in a purely technical way .  but it's also empty , pretentious and boring .  like last year's the thin red line , it's a movie by a director who doesn't know what he wants to say but goes ahead and says it anyway .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  "|-0.55|0.8666666666666667|0.7666666666666666|The general sentiment is negative as the reviewer finds the film lacking substance, pretentious, and boring, despite acknowledging Spike Lee's filmmaking skills and some notable performances.

0|"the summer of 00' wasn't a very good one for devout cinephiles .  it offered no blair witches or sixth senses ; the best big budget hollywood could do was an efficient x-men adaptation and a flawed but entertaining shaft update .  nurse betty signals the unofficial end of that dreadful summer movie season and the commencement of a potentially brighter fall movie season , that battery-charging ( at least for critics who have to sit through every piece o' shit that moseys into multiplexes ) time of year when all those oscar contenders ( read : "" quality "" films ) compete for audiences .  alas betty has the dubious distinction of being the first overpraised junk heap of the new season .  it's also indie director neil labute's first attempt at something resembling a mainstream picture , and i'm sad to report it's a resounding failure ( at least on this web site ) , a mess that's as hopelessly saccharine as people have accused labute's previous films of being unrelentingly masochistic .  i went in expecting something decent , for betty was gleefully praised , it's screenplay even winning an award at cannes , but i exited shaking my noggin in bewilderment .  are critics so desperate for something unique that they're blind to how derivative the particular brand of "" uniqueness "" betty dolls out is ?  for the first time labute is working from a script he has not written , and he seems unsure of how to handle the material .  betty tries to be hip like pulp fiction ( this is another flick featuring a pair of strangely bright and articulate hit men ) , enchanting like the wizard of oz ( of which this film makes several allusions to ) and heartwarming like [stick in your favorite loveable misfit movie] , but by the end it left me cold with its calculated desperation .  it's labute's half hearted attempt to make a crowd pleaser and he doesn't even seem to have half that heart in it .  nurse betty concerns a soap opera addict , betty ( brilliantly played by renee zellweger ) , who witnesses the killing of her husband , del ( aaron eckhart playing the most casually loutish husband since richard benjamin in diary of a mad housewife ) by two hit men ( morgan freeman and chris rock ) .  she happens to have her most beloved soap on in the background and somehow merges the two realities .  she's blocked out her husband's death and thinks she's a character in her favorite soap , a reason to love .  betty sets out on the road to la ( with some drugs unknowingly stashed in her car trunk ) searching for her soap boyfriend dr . david ravell ( greg kinnear ) while the two bickering hit men follow in not so close pursuit .  the labute who birthed the extraordinary in the company of men , slipped a bit ( but not much ) with his sophomore effort , your friends and neighbors , then fell straight on his ass with bash , a play he penned that was recently aired on showtime .  the play demonstrated no forward movement as an artist , only labute's persistence in wallowing in the horrid things "" average "" people do to each other , usually with out realizing how horrid they themselves are .  in the play , paul rudd , as an obnoxious jock , delivers a monologue detailing how he once followed a gay man into a bathroom and beat him maybe to death , while his clueless girlfriend essentially regards his sadistic behaviors as something along the old maxim "" boys will be boys "" .  another character , schlubby businessman reacts to the loss of his job by actually killing his own baby !  what was once so powerful about labute's work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic .  obviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty isn't it .  he clearly has little passion for what he's doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn't managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience .  nearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft-boiled tarantino-esque dialogue .  they evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that's represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) .  i think rock is a great comic yet he hasn't been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it's like he's doing the damn chris rock show .  surprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks .  that wide-open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty-year-old body .  it's the best work she's ever done .  freeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it .  the actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty's , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality .  that's interesting but the movie doesn't do anything with it other than crash land the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle .  the film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie's in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it's parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing .  the film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke .  betty's screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty wouldn't make any progress in the film .  nurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim's wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim's girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too tidy , don'tcha think .  betty has an interesting theme , though it doesn't even seem aware of this .  the current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way .  this is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real-life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) .  instead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the '80s than the '00s ) , the film simply uses betty's delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b . no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation .

0|"wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day ? provided , of course , that you're the victim of a frontal lobotomy .  there is , in fact , no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at : movie-goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group .  this is film noir for the mtv generation : fast-paced , slick , flashy , gleefully mindless , and hollow to the core .  wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998 .  i've seen more convincing drama ( with nearly as much bare flesh ) on that pinnacle of narrative quality , baywatch .  wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it's a thriller with a real story .  what it is , however , is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists .  everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast , a spatter of blood , and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie .  the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen , and that will probably be it .  using this approach , i was right three times and wrong only once .  that's not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what's around the next corner .  the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie : the hot , young cast and the old standby , sex .  both have an abundance of screen time , although i'll admit that the film's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected .  nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu ? .  the soft-core sex sequences are generic , and don't generate much heat .  the lesbian kisses can't hold a candle to those in bound .  theresa russell and denise richards have only token topless appearances ( neve campbell , possessing an iron-clad "" no nudity "" clause in her contract , keeps her clothes more or less on ) .  the film's greatest curiosity is a full frontal shot of kevin bacon climbing out of the shower .  maybe a few girls will skip seeing a fully-clothed leonardo dicaprio for the thirteenth time in titanic to catch a glimpse of what kyra sedgwick ( mrs .  kevin bacon ) is familiar with .  the director of wild things is john mcnaughton , whose last effort was the finely-tuned psychological thriller , normal life .  that movie featured copious sex , a pair of real characters , and a powerful script .  it's difficult to believe that something this shallow could come from the same film maker .  but i suppose we all need to put food on the table .  mcnaughton appears to have completely lost his way here , in what is obviously a stab at mainstream success ( his previous wide-release picture , mad dog and glory , was a box-office disappointment ) .  quick cuts and pretty sunrises can't even begin to cover up this movie's flaws .  the main character ( and i use that term lightly , since no one in wild things shows more than an occasional flash of personality ) is sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a guidance counselor at florida's blue bay high school .  a student , the deliciously curvaceous kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , has a crush on him .  one afternoon , she comes to his house to wash his car , and , when she leaves , her clothing is torn .  after confessing to her mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped , she goes to the police station , where she tells her story to detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) .  they are skeptical about here claims until another girl , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , comes forward with a similar tale .  meanwhile , sam , convinced that he's being set up , goes to a shyster lawyer ( bill murray ) for help .  the acting in wild things isn't very good , but none of the principals have much to work with .  this is definitely not a character- based motion picture .  not only does the ludicrous screenplay ignore the possibility that someone in the audience may have a triple-digit i . q . , but it doesn't bother to give any of the on-screen individuals even a hint of depth .  the men and women populating the picture are there to look nice , but nothing more .  matt dillon is given plenty of opportunities to flex his biceps .  neve campbell gets to model the slutty look .  denise richards strikes a fetching pose in a see-through , one-piece bathing suit .  and nothing in the film gets a rise out of kevin bacon .  the only one who's even remotely interesting is bill murray , and he seems to think he's in comedy , not a thriller ( maybe he's got the right idea ) .  columbia pictures has specifically requested that critics not reveal the film's ending , which prompts the question : which ending do they want kept secret ?  wild things has no less than three ( one occurs during the end credits , so stay seated ) , all of which are jaw-droppingly absurd -- a feat that joe eszterhas ( the writer of basic instinct and showgirls ) would be impressed by .  thanks to jeffrey kimball's polished , kinetic cinematography , wild things always looks great , and george s . clinton's score keeps it pulsing and throbbing .  but , no matter how shiny the superficial sheen is , this is still trash , and , like all garbage , it stinks .

"" metro "" happens to be a lot better than any film in the "" beverly hills cop "" series .  that is because "" metro "" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun .  eddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people .  the "" beverly hills cop "" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch .  in "" metro "" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble .  his character in "" metro "" takes himself seriously .  eddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in "" metro , "" and perhaps it is quite better off that way .  murphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator .  in the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up .  murphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor .  the film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim .   "" metro "" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car .  cars flip .  cars crash .  cars turn over .  and it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of "" speed , "" and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons .  there are also some other good scenes in "" metro "" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have .  scenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning .  of course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling .  the scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too .  those are the scenes that make up "" metro , "" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality .  the actor that i most enjoyed seeing in "" metro "" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation .  it was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius .  rapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit .  i hardly recognized him in "" metro , "" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more .  there are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices .  the villain in "" metro "" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless .  he is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take .  wincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in "" kiss of death . ""  and , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list .  i liked "" metro , "" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy .  his past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family .   "" metro "" is a no-nonsense movie .  it works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay .  it works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay .  it works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay .  and it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out .  but who cares ?  it still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself .  oh , and there were plenty of explosions in "" metro , "" as well .  how nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those .  if there is one major objection i had to "" metro "" , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes .   "" metro "" is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited for it to end .  paul haynes "" >  "|0.741|0.85|0.9333333333333332|"The film ""Metro"" receives positive feedback for its engaging action, suspense, and comedy, as well as Eddie Murphy's performance.

0|"capsule : dumb dud of an entry in the body heat sweepstakes , and now something of a landmark for having spawned a jillion clones .  basic instinct's worst crime is that it's not just a bad movie , but in many ways , an incompetent one as well .  it's stupid in itself , and stupid to think its audience is as stupid as it is .  it's supposed to be a thriller , but the plot is dead on its feet , and ultimately arbitrary ; it's only put into the movie to jerk us around .  it's also supposed to be sexy , but it's instead got the unpleasant rawness of a teenager showing younger kids his collections of dirty pictures .  it's a ripoff .  the story opens with a rock star being murdered while in the throes of orgasm .  the biggest suspect is an authoress , catherine tramell ( sharon stone ) , who wrote a novel in which the murder was eerily presaged .  or maybe it's the work of a copycat ?  these and other plot threads get fed to the detective who's on the case ( michael douglas ) , who has a few problems himself .  like we wonder if his elevator goes to the top floor .  we can measure with a stopwatch the time from them setting eyes on each other to the moment they are doing the mattress dance .  joe eszterhas has written the screenplay , and he uses a device that he used before in the much better jagged edge : the killer's identity is kept a secret until the movie's final shot .  this isn't in itself a problem -- the problem is that up until that point , we've been given nothing to work with .  every clue in the movie -- every clue -- is ambiguous .  the whole thriller aspect of the movie is a shill .  red herrings , dead plot threads , violence , and kinky sexuality litter the movie like potholes in manhattan streets .  they add up to zip , because they're not happening to people we care about .  douglas's character is foulmouthed and bitter and that's it ; stone's character has an iron-on smile that never changes ; the rest are forgettable .  when we don't even have the luxury of giving a damn about anyone in the movie , who cares what happens in it ?  especially with an ending that is not only unsatisfying , but in many ways inexplicable ?   ( a friend of mine once came up with a rule of thumb about movie characters : "" if no one in the movie behaves like anyone you know , or would * care * to know , just leave ! "" )  one of the nastier things about the movie is the way it treats lesbianism not as an integral part of someone's life , but as a kind of kink -- something to thrill men with .  i despair whenever i encounter this kind of stupidity in mainstream entertainment ; are we still so culturally neanderthal that the only way to include something like that in a big-budget hollywood film is as a hefnerism ?

""  my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it .  they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles .  the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious .  that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast .  gary "" gal "" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain .  life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing .  but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch .  the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa .  the second punch comes from gal's past .  back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal .  he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal .  don will accept any decision gal makes from "" yes "" to "" certainly . ""  however , if gal says "" no "" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) .  in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin .  kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness .  there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming .  when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success .  beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him .  any local hood could have done what gal is needed for .  additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault .  no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool .  in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar .  i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade .  the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability .  the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im .  it is not a great plot .  in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards .  perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film .  it is an old plot dressed up to look new .  if the plot is old , at least the style is creative .  this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout .  his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences .  cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes .  we see one side of a person's faces .  but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit .  half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden .  we yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog .  at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language .  sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film .  the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western .  further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance .  i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

0|dear god , this is a fantastically bad film !  regardless of what i say about knock off , you can't grasp its awfulness from my words .  you have to see it and experience it for yourself .  here's the kicker , though -- i suggest that you do so .  yes , this is a bad film -- easily one of the most incompetent films of the year -- but it has a certain misguided charm that makes it a unique kind of disaster to endure .  in fact , i enjoyed myself for most of its brief running time , despite the dreadful acting and a completely incomprehensible story .  don't get me wrong : i'm not excusing knock off .  it reaches an unacceptable level of badness ; it's so incoherent that i wonder if it was hacked up worse than the avengers was .  it also features some truly terrible performances from lela rochon , michael wong , paul sorvino , and -- of course -- jean-claude van damme .  it does , however , have the entertaining presence of rob schneider , and the excessively inventive and pretentious direction of tsui hark .  as i watched it , i occasionally wondered if it was aware of its own awfulness .  now , in retrospect , it seems clear that it wasn't , but it's still a fascinating kind of mess .  i don't like writing plot descriptions ( it is , by far , the most boring part of writing a review ) , but , in this case , i'm off the hook : there is no way i could write an accurate synopsis for knock off .  for the sake of comparison , i had no trouble understanding the usual suspects during my first viewing .  i paid closer attention to knock off , and the only thing i am able to say about it is that van damme plays a dude named ray , and is accused by the cia ( i think ) of selling knock off products ( knock off products are , of course , products that look like name-brand materials but are generic and cheap ) .  i don't know what any of this has to do with martial arts , but there are lots of martial arts in the film .  ray is good at martial arts , so when he has to beat up bad guys , there's no problem .  rob schneider plays his sidekick , although i had no idea who he really was by the end of the film .  lela rochon is just some woman who accuses them of stuff , while paul sorvino is both the good guy and the bad guy at once !  in fact , every character goes through so many shifts from good to bad that the end provides absolutely no insight into what any of them really do .  in that order , knock off is completely incoherent and makes absolutely no sense .  but what a strange mess it is .  it was written by stephen e . de souza , who also wrote die hard and 48 hours .  can this be the same man ?  i don't see how , unless , of course , huge chunks of the film have been removed for the sake of running time .  knock off seems to have an interesting premise ( as far as action films go ) , but there's no semblance here .  for instance , van damme is introduced , and then seconds later he's running a chariot race through the streets of hong kong .  why ?  who knows .  what are the implications of this ?  i have no idea .  most action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem .  knock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut .  the acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity .  sorvino , in addition , deserves better than this .  van damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) .  the only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time .  tsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison .  they're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe .  but his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ? ) is well-choreographed .  lots of the scenes are pitched well to comedy , such as our heroes' first encounter with the rochon character .  but did tsui know that his film is beyond ludicrous ?  i hope he did , for the alternative is a frightening thought .  knock off has the feel of a truly terrible exercise in camp mania .  if it were boring , i'd give it zero stars .  but it's not boring : it's loud and excessive and completely incoherent .  it's also funny , even when it isn't meaning to be funny .  a bad film that succeeds as entertainment doesn't deserve to be fully lambasted .  i recognize knock off for its irrefutable badness , but i can't deny it's zany , useless charm .  oh , i know , they're just action scenes looking desperately for a real story , but they're fun action scenes amongst a crowd of laughably inane concepts .  it's fun to admire the awfulness of a film like this , but that doesn't excuse the fact that it is , indeed , awful .  |-0.6|0.8833333333333334|0.8333333333333334|"The film ""Knock Off"" is universally described as fantastically bad and incompetent, with its awful acting, incoherent story, and overall incompetence.

0|synopsis : the president of a company wants to test his self-appointed successor , who's psychotic , and thinks it's a great idea to spend a week with him and their wives in an isolated cabin a hundred miles from civilization with no dependable transportation or means of communication after a heavy snowfall .  comments : tracks of a killer had a couple of strikes against it before i even began watching it .  strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape's sticker in black marker ( not typically a good sign when you rent a film ) .  strike two came while the previews played .  did you ever get a sinking premonition about a movie's quality ( or lack thereof ) while watching the trailers that come before it ?  well , the cheesy films being advertised before tracks of a killer were films that no one has ever heard of starring people no one knows , and they all looked bad ( definately not a good sign ) .  tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout .  about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery .  to be fair , the first half-hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller .  wolf larson , who bears more than a passing resemblance to hugh grant , adequately plays the underling obviously set up as the killer of the film's title .  james brolin and kelly lebrock seem equally adequate as the loving couple larson will later threaten .  brolin's character , for some inexplicable reason , thinks its a great idea to spend some time in a cabin , practically isolated , with lebrock and larson , whom he's decided to test for the week before giving him full control of his company .  by the time the characters arrive at the cabin , this film begins to become tedious .  apparently , brolin's successor's test involves chopping wood for the fireplace and skiing , which don't seem like attributes necessary to run a business in the city .  but , then again , what do i know about business ?  i do think , though , that they should have invested in some better furniture for the cabin ; its beds and closets have a habit of just breaking at the slightest touch .  larson's character accidently kills his own wife rather than the couple he wants to kill .  this leaves the movie with an hour to go and only three characters , which really isn't enough to sustain it .  the film's writer must have taken a cue from stephen king , as scenes from tracks of a killer seem lifted out of misery and gerald's game .  larson and lebrock fight and torture each other ( the tables get turned a couple of times ) while brolin tramps around in the snow looking for help .  some old guy's around too , just so the killer can add to his body count without killing the couple , who everyone knows will be alive at the end of the film .  the old guy , however , miraculously survives his first death and appears later to be killed again by the killer in a scene so ludicrous it's worthy of a chuckle or two .  outside of that chuckle , unfortunately , tracks of a killer will just bore you as the obvious plot is drawn out ad infinitum and the actors , for some reason , become increasing obnoxious .  if you're in a video store and thinking about renting this turkey , don't .  make tracks to a far superior suspense film , like misery .  |-0.5833333333333334|0.8333333333333334|0.7999999999999999|"The overall consensus from the explanations is that the movie ""Tracks of a Killer"" has several negative aspects, including poor quality, lack of well-known actors, tedious plot, and obnoxious actors.

"" mission to mars "" manages to be both stupid and boring at the same time .  the plot , cribbed greatly from "" 2001 , "" concerns a team sent to mars , the first manned trip ever made to the red planet .  luke graham ( don cheadle ) leads the team , jointly formed of americans and russians .  the team encounters a mysterious monolith that emits a strange pulse ( this being nothing like the pulse-emitting monolith in "" 2001 "" -- that one was on the * moon * ) , but when they try to study it , a giant sand tornado comes out of the top and swallows them ( all except luke , who survives long enough to send a garbled message back to the rotating space station , which looks strangely like the rotating space station in "" 2001 "" ) .  a rescue mission is planned with husband & wife team woody blake ( tim robbins ) and terri fisher ( connie nielsen ) , obligatory pilot with a troubled past jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , and extra crew member phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) along for the ride .  after some zero-gravity dancing , they run into problems when one of their engines is blown , forcing them to attempt a desperate landing aboard a supply vessel .  now stranded on mars with minimal supplies , the team must decide whether or not it can risk entering the monolith or if they should return home .  after all , that monolith just might contain information about how life originated on earth .   "" mission to mars "" is one of those films that makes a critic wonder where to start when talking about all the things that are wrong with it , so let's start with one of the things that does work : director brian de palma manages to create some eerie tension in a few scenes during the middle of the film .  that's it .  everything else fails .  the failure isn't de palma's fault ; he's working from an atrocious script .  only during the sequence aboard the ship ( looking an awful lot like the jupiter vessel in "" 2001 "" ) where the rescue team's air begins running out and they must frantically search for the hole and patch it up does "" mission to mars "" come to life .  a scene where they attempt to save a comrade floating away into space also provides some tension , until you realize that the entire danger/more danger/attempted rescue sequence has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film ; it's just a contrived way to generate thrilling scenes .  take it out , and the plot isn't affected in any way .  the sequence also suffers from a few plot holes ( as does the rest of the film ) : why is the ship's computer ( which sounds strangely like hal from , uh , "" 2001 "" ) able to detect a hole in the main chamber but not one in the engine ?  why did tim robbins' character have to go outside the ship when the solution easily presented itself from inside ?  shouldn't the astronauts be better trained to deal with a hull breach ?  why are the characters such idiots ?  because the script makes little attempt to properly develop them .  all the "" conflict "" is clumsily delivered in excruciatingly obvious exposition in the opening scene ( which rips off orson welles and robert altman by utilizing a long opening tracking shot ) during which the characters repeatedly tell each other about things all of them should already know : "" jim , it's too bad you can't go on this mission because you were determined 'psychologically inadequate' because your wife died right before you were to go on the mission together "" -- does anyone really talk like this ?  can't we find out these things in a less grating matter , like maybe in a flashback ?  the whole film is like that .  the filmmakers are not content to merely show us something and assume we know what's going on ; they must * tell * us exactly what we're looking at * every * time .  sample dialogue from the film : ( shot of mars ) astronaut a : "" look , there's mars "" astronaut b : "" you sure that's mars ? ""  astronaut a : "" yeah , that's mars all right . ""  astronaut c : "" hey , are you guys looking at mars ? ""  that exchange isn't actually in "" mission to mars , "" but i wouldn't be surprised if it were .  for all their cribbing from kubrick , spielberg , james cameron , and even ron howard , the makers of this film haven't learned to do something all those directors did very well : show and don't tell .  de palma used to know how , but seems to have forgotten .  this is mentally-challenged filmmaking ; they assume the audience won't get what's going on , so they explain everything five times over .  fourth-graders may appreciate this , but more learned viewers will have their intelligence insulted .  the principal actors sleepwalk their way through "" mission to mars , "" never managing to do away with an apparent "" i'm just here to get a paycheck "" attitude .  cheadle stumbles over his awkward lines .  armin mueller-stahl manages to thoroughly embarrass himself in an unbilled cameo .  robbins puts his game face on and phones in his standard "" decent guy "" performance .  and sinise hams it up with "" wistful "" facial expressions while watching tapes of his dead wife ( played by kim delaney , who only has one scene during which she still manages to deliver some ridiculous dialogue in a heavy-handed monologue about the meaning of life ) , and especially during the stolen-from-no-less-than-three-movies ( a lollipop to whoever names them ) conclusion , which combines endless , obvious explanation and sub-par cgi effects with gagging sentimentality and is sure to alienate any viewers who had been enjoying the show up until then .  and of course , these aliens from mars who facilitated the evolution of life on earth are entirely different from the aliens in "" 2001 "" who facilitated the evolution of life on earth ; those aliens were from an * unknown * world .  it could be said that fans of brainless action films might enjoy "" mission to mars , "" but such a comment ignores the fact that the film is also incredibly slow-going .  leisurely pacing might have helped a film with a little more substance to it , but all of the substance of "" mission to mars "" has been stolen from other films , and those other films dealt with their ideas in a much more thoughtful fashion and generally contained more engaging characters .  supposedly we're intended to choke up when one character decides not to return home at the end of this one ( totally different from the one-character-decides-not-to-return ending of "" armageddon "" ) , but i suspect most people will either be laughing or groaning .  me , i alternated between the two .  there is only one good thing about the way "" mission to mars "" finally ends : the fact that the movie is over .

"" after all , "" he explains , "" who reads government documents ? ""  lead by harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , a top secret federal operative , the group descends to a mobile undersea headquarters set up next to the alien vessel .  once there they stroll over , knock on the door and explore the still-operational ufo .  discovering the surprising origin of the ship and the crew finds an astonishing gigantic golden liquid metal sphere .  when adams enters the sphere , the weirdness unfolds .  a storm rolls in on the surface and the team is forced to remain below just as an unseen presence begins to communicate through their computer .   "" my name is jerry .  i am happy "" flashes across the screen .  this is unsettling for the psychologist .   "" what happens if jerry gets mad ? "" he asks .  barnes is more pragmatic : he needs a last name because he can't put in his report that they made contact with an alien named jerry .  then the situation turns bad .  deadly beasts appear from nowhere .  a gang of jellyfish kills one of the navy personnel .  lethal sea snakes attack goodman .  a giant squid batters the habitat just as adams is reading "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea "" .  the suspicious scientists turn against each other .  this has all the makings of a first-rate thinking man's science fiction film .  however even the finest ingredients don't go very far in the hands of a chief who doesn't seem to care about his product .  director barry levinson has churned out a mish-mosh that doesn't engage the audience beyond a few skillful suspense scenes .  the first of the film zooms by as the situation and players are introduced without any characterization or justification .  it's much like speed-reading a novel and realizing that you missed the nuances .  it doesn't get any better when the action scenes begin .  while the actors do an adequate job with their limited roles , the people are still flat .  oddly they hardly have reactions when deaths occur around them .  after adams experiences the interior of the sphere , no one bothers to ask him what happened .  their history together is an intriguing plot device but is barely exploited .  even goodman and halperin's ill-conceived affair when she was his student is just mentioned in passing .  her psychotic tendencies are talked about but never convincing .  there's a truism that items shown early in a movie must be used before the ending , but here they are far too obvious .  when an emergency mini-sub is explained , you know what's going to happen .  the movie affectations are nothing more than distracting .  chapter headings that divide the movie have no function .  the shaky camera work muddies already perplexing chaos .  much of what goes on is confusing and difficult to follow .  although some of the disorientation eventually is understandable , a great deal of it isn't .  even a science fiction film must be internally consistent .  there's too much here that doesn't make sense .  are the manifestations real ?  the jellyfish kill queen latifa ( in a throw-away role ) and the squid nearly destroys the outpost , but the bites of the fatal snakes have no effect .  a scene in the sub suggests that it's illusion , but earlier episodes indicate that it's not .  not everything has to be explained to death , but there are major questions that the film never answers .  where the ship came from is clarified , but how it ended up on the ocean floor in 1709 is merely alluded to .  even the enigmatic sphere is still mysterious when the credits roll .  the climax is followed by 15 minutes of epilogue that does little but weaken the already labored tale .  after pre-release audience testing , the actors were called back to re-shoot the ending .  it's difficult to imagine how the original could have been worse .  following the recent tradition of lengthy films , this weighs in at over two very long hours .  the weak scenes could have been cut , but then there wouldn't have been much left .  the movie was supposedly held up by effects work , but there's nothing special on the screen .  we never even see the monstrous squid or the menacing storm .  stealing from "" alien "" , "" the abyss "" and the disastrous "" event horizon "" , this film has learned nothing from them .  remarkably levinson and hoffman's other currently showing film is "" wag the dog "" , a smart and entertaining piece of work .  this one could have been titled the same sans one word .

0|"renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star's 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller .  tsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances .  writer steven e . desouza's fairly straightforward plotline isn't as outre as _double_team_'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little .  van damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans .  it's all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . .   . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ .  while all of van damme's films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting "" skills "" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme's embarrassing directorial effort , 1996's _the_quest_ ) .  a lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : "" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! ""  and "" entrepreneurship , babycakes ! ""  standing out among my favorites .  but it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_'s laughs .  van damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual .  early scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus's business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way .  even typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug .  paul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider's cia superior ; and lela rochon , playing an investigator for the jeans company , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode .  in rochon's defense , though , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs , exquisite bone structure , and perky bosoms , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage .  tsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work .  here , though , tsui's visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise .  for each nifty trick tsui pulls off , such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices , there are others that are completely superfluous .  this is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context .  for instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box .  as he puts his hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen .  it's undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something .  the test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired .  tsui does what he can to make something of them , employing freeze frames , blurred motion , and unconventional camera angles , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza .  there isn't anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alone anything remotely close to tsui's legendary hong kong works ( but that's a given going in ) .  if tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo's stateside success , he would do best to break free from van damme . . .  before it's too late .  if he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ , the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish . . .  that is , if it hasn't already disappeared entirely after this fiasco .

0|"warning : may contain slight mild spoilers .  rated : r for intense violence/gore , some strong sexuality and language .  starring : arnold schwarzeneggar , robin tunney , rod stieger , gabriel byrne .  running time : 132 minutes  we go into a movie theater , boom !  the lights go down , our hearts race , we go through ten minutes of preview and finally the movie we've been waiting to see for a long time comes on .  we sit there , watch in disbelief that this movie is as bad as it is .  why shouldn't i have know what i was getting myself into .  again like this past summers hit "" stigmata "" , "" end of days "" may be worse .  it's not like this is any kind of original idea , it just throws in some "" rosemary's baby "" , along with "" the devil's advocate "" a little "" exorcist "" and some "" stigmata "" here and there .  whala you have "" end of days "" a movie that is extremely disappointing and by the previews made it look terrific .  sadly but truly again like most recent films , all the good parts are in the trailers .  the plot which is very confusing at times is also very ludicrous and the movie is destined to be a hit in the first weekend , and flop in the next .  jericho cane ( arnold schwarzneggar in hit typical macho role ) is a cop who finds out that he is chosen to track down satan ( living in gabriel byrnes body ) and stop him from impregnating christine york ( robin tunney ) because if he does , and she gives birth all existence as we know it will cease to exist .  he has to do this before it turns into the year 2000 , and strangely he's trying to fight him 5 minutes before 2000 comes .  he seeks help from the catholic church and help from rod stieger ( in a terrific role ) and tries to save this girl leading to an ending that's satisfying , but turns into a typical action movie .  that's pretty much it on plot .  it does have the razzle and dazzle of a great action movie , and with the 100m dollar budget parts seem to show it , parts you have to wonder where all the money went .  as for arnie ?  good role , ok performance .  i think since he is getting a little older he is held back a lot of his stunts .  the thing that disappointed me was the fact that there was nothing to the film .  in the trailers it looks like a good scary , action film and ends up being a boring , long and preposterous drama that leads into something else that leaves us with questions .  gabriel byrnes ( who ironically played a priest in "" stigmata "" ) here plays satan and gives a good performance but again seems held back and not into his character .  two years back al pacino gave a terrific performance in the fun "" the devil's advocate "" and here it seems like the idea of him is in the character also .  robin tunney ( great performance as always ) plays satan's main person whom he wants to impregnate to carry his child .  of course rod stieger gives another great performance which really isn't nothing new .  the direction by peter hyams is at times a bit overblown , though not nearly as the visual style was in "" stigmata "" .  here we are given great camera work , and some great scenes that are terrifically directed but sadly just don't work in this movie .  the script written by andrew marlowe has a few witty lines , but again the movie is all style and no substance and by the ending finale climax i was ready to go home .  only a few things work here and those are a few of the performances , the writing and visual style , but the storyline and the finished product don't work as well .  the sad thing is that "" end of days "" had so many things going for it .  the plot could have been more organized , the action scenes could have been more brainy and less mind-numbing .  at times it seems like "" armageddon "" and started to get old and tiresome .  hollywood is running out of ideas bad , and like i've always said before needs new ones .  even with its 100m budget "" end of days "" is less than pleasing .  in fact the 100m dollar budget is at least 30m over , and easily could have had a 70m budget .  maybe i sound crazy , but i am really looking forward to the new exorcist film , and hope that they make it as good as the original .  we need to get new ideas and stop recycling old ones just to make money at the box-office .  we need to get more films like "" the blair witch project "" that could scare people to death , while people thinking well what exactly is scaring them and how do i know that it is in fact the blair witch .  overblown effects , stupid and thin plot-line , good performances , disappointing . . . . umm  yup those pretty much describe "" end of days "" .

0|" "" my name is jack carter , and you don't want to know me "" says our brooding anti-hero ( sylvester stallone ) .  take his advice !  to know this guy is as rewarding as being thrown over a terrace .  and to watch this film is almost as painful .   "" get carter "" is a gloomy looking , unimaginative film that offers no joy .  jack carter is as tough as tough guys come .  he works out of vegas as a self-described 'financial adjuster' .  explaining his duties , he says , "" people make promises and break them .  i help them remember . ""  he has a chiseled body full of tattoos .  he has the weathered look indicative of a man who has seen his share of hard times .  he speaks in a hushed but menacing tone of voice .  in other words , this is sylvester stallone acting like . . . sylvester  stallone .  and like most of his previous roles , his character is a shallow , one-dimensional thug whose modus operandi is to talk tough , hassle a few hapless people , find out what he needs to know , and then dispense his own kind of justice .  with the charisma of a pit bull , being tough is all that jack carter knows .  yet , even tough guys know when to put family first .  as the story begins , we learn that jack's little brother has died in a car accident .  the police attribute it to heavy drinking .  however , jack is suspicious , believing that he was 'taken out' .  he takes a break from his vegas duties and tries to see if he can find the truth .  as he pokes around , he runs into several lowlife characters .  they include a shady business partner , a prostitute , a dweebish millionaire molded after bill gates , and an oily owner of a porn website .  any one of them may know something about his brother's death .  all of them have the means of carrying out the deed .  but don't expect an exercise in sleuthing where well-placed clues lead carter to the truth .  he's all brawn and no brains , so there are no epiphanies during his investigation .  instead , he uses intimidation to muscle his way forward , cycling through this circle of suspects .  flustered with his lack of progress , he cycles through them again and again .  this all gets tiring fairly quickly .  by the time the film launches into its final act , we're numb from its pedestrian pace .  oddly , as a tough-guy thriller , it starves us for action .  admittedly , there is one nifty chase sequence , but this is related to a tangential and needless plot ( carter's vegas ties send thugs to retrieve him ) .  the story also fails to generate any kind of emotion .  stallone has the personality of a slab of stone .  and the look and feel of the film is perpetually downcast .  the weather is constantly overcast or rainy .  meanwhile , most shots take place at night , in dimly lit rooms , or in dark alleys .  it's just impossible to get stirred about that kind of atmosphere .  as a result , "" get carter "" amounts to nothing more than a flat thriller , bereft of clever moments and devoid of any excitement .  you're better off leaving this guy alone .
