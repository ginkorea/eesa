1|`strange days' chronicles the last two days of 1999 in los angeles .  as the locals gear up for the new millenium , lenny nero ( ralph fiennes ) goes about his business of peddling erotic memory clips .  he pines for his ex-girlfriend , faith ( juliette lewis ) , not noticing that another friend , mace ( angela bassett ) really cares for him .  this film features good performances , impressive film-making technique and breath-taking crowd scenes .  director kathryn bigelow knows her stuff and does not hesitate to use it .  but as a whole , this is an unsatisfying movie .  the problem is that the writers , james cameron and jay cocks , were too ambitious , aiming for a film with social relevance , thrills , and drama .  not that ambitious film-making should be discouraged ; just that when it fails to achieve its goals , it fails badly and obviously .  the film just ends up preachy , unexciting and uninvolving .  |-0.3333333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.7999999999999999|The majority of the explanations indicate a negative sentiment towards the film, citing reasons such as it being unsatisfying, preachy, unexciting, and uninvolving.

1|"there's a thin line between satire and controversy , and mike nichols ( the birdcage , wolf ) has directed a sharp and very honest look at a us presidential election .  based on the book written by "" anonymous "" ( actually former "" newsweek "" writer joe klein ) , john travolta plays governor jack stanton .  but he doesn't actually play stanton .  he plays bill clinton ; just the same as emma thompson no doubt plays the first lady and billy bob thorton is the campaign manipulator james carville ( although the credits will of course say otherwise ) .  the film is taken from the perspective of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , a morally correct and somewhat hesitant new advisor to stanton .  he searches for justice and dignity in the ugliest possible situations , and whether it be keeping the history of his boss' pants under wraps or contemplating digging up dirt on another politician , he approaches his work with a keen desire to skillfully serve his country and his fellow workers .  richard jemmons ( billy bob thorton ) and daisy green ( maura tierney ) team up with henry as the would-be president's advisors , and hire lesbian veteran libby holden ( kathy bates ) as the campaign's eccentric "" tougher than dirt "" incriminator .  together they face all sorts of sexual allegations , the irritatingly discourteous media and other witty politicians in the election race .  in its satire and controversy , primary colors is a similar film to wag the dog : they both are not afraid to wipe their noses in the nitty-gritty and take a bold look at something that will never has honesty as a virtue .  but whereas wag showed us how much affect a few people can have on the media , primary colors is much more concerned with fleshing out it's characters , letting us understand what they want and why , and making us truly appreciate the humanity and rectitude that they graciously represent .  seeing john travolta play bill clinton so confidently and justly is enough to make the film more than worth a look .  and the rest of the cast also make superb performances - adrian lester sharply portrays the intellect of henry whilst kathy bates is perfect as the robust and energetic libby holden .  at occasions , you can't help but feel that these terrific characters are going to waste .  there are long slabs of time where john travolta ( unquestionably the most interesting to watch ) is missed from the screen ; and since it is awkwardly structured as henry's story we are often forced to watch scenes that perhaps are not so necessary to the central plot - or even the point of the film .  having said that , make no mistake - primary colors is always enjoyable to watch .  but frequently we have to ask ourselves - exactly what are we watching ?  most of the first half of its duration is a lightheaded look at melodramatic confrontations that seem so genuine we cannot help but laugh , but the way primary colors chooses to finish tackles aspects that are very contrary , and almost unsuitable , to the rest of the film .  but as i mentioned before , there is a thin line between satire and controversy - and for the most part , primary colors delivers an entertaining indulgence of political matters combined with a far-from-overpowering look at winning the public's opinion .  although at occasions the film may jump around a little too freely , focus is never lost on how important and vulnerable the subject matter really is .  thankfully , it is clear to make the distinction on what is entertaining movie cosmetics and what is a provocative documentation of something so really it's scary .

1|it was only a matter of time before a dilbert-esque office comedy hit the screens .  however , rather than coming from dilbert creator scott adams , office space is instead based on the work of another animator , mike judge , creator of beavis and butthead and king of the hill .  in his live-action directoral debut , judge aptly spoofs corporate culture .  the story is certainly not very involved , but there is plenty of truth and humor to fill the gaps .  peter ( ron livingston ) is a programmer working at the initech corporation .  every day in his mundane life is worse than the one before . . . in  other words , every day is the worst day in his entire life .  he's stuck in a boring job with eight different supervisors , all obsessed with administrative trivialities .  he's smitten with joanna ( jennifer aniston ) , a local waitress , but hasn't the guts to even introduce himself .  everything has simply made him a complete , nervous wreck .  but all of that changes when , after an unintentionally over-effective visit to a hypnotherapist , peter loses all of his inhibitions .  he realizes his lifelong dream : to do absolutely nothing .  he begins to blatantly disregard the nonsensical instructions of his boss , bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) , doing whatever he feels like .  peter's friends and co-workers , samir ( ajay naidu ) and michael bolton ( david herman ) . . . no ,  not that michael bolton , are perplexed by their friend's sudden change in attitude .  but , they have larger things to worry about : rumors about that initech is about to begin downsizing . . .  as bleak as much of this sounds , let me assure you that office space is a comedy , and quite a funny one .  although it shares the same absurdist office humor of the dilbert comic strip , office space is actually based loosely on the series of milton cartoons which aired on saturday night life .  each mundane detail , taken by itself , seems completely , regrettably , plausible .  yet , when combined into a whole , the picture which results is absolutely surreal .  ron livingston tackles his role straight-faced , and becomes much funnier because of it .  his character isn't simply being a clown lampooning around the office , but rather seems possessed by a zen-like clarity .  he is operating on a higher plane , where everything suddenly makes sense , and from this vantage point , he allows the audience to smirk at the absurdities of life .  anyone who has had to deal with the inefficiencies of corporate bureaucracy , or who has ever been frustrated with the technology of modern life , will recognize many of the characters and situations in the film .  in fact , in addition to being wildly humorous , the film may actually prove to be cathartic .  the animated roots of office space show in the film's lack of complexity .  most of the characters in the film can be quickly summarized by a particular personality quirk .  one employee , milton ( stephen root ) , is practically a flesh-and-blood cartoon .  however , despite their simple nature , the characters still manage to be surprisingly funny .  it's not required to have a corporate background to enjoy this film ( though the situations may seem exceedingly far-fetched if you are unfamiliar with just how close to reality they really are ) .  the film is flimsy and absurd , but also very funny .  |0.6333333333333334|0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|"The explanations agree that the text expresses a positive sentiment towards the movie ""Office Space"" by emphasizing its humor, relatability to corporate culture, and the cathartic effect it may have on viewers."
1|all those who were offended by there's something about mary should not tread in the waters of american pie , a gratuitously sexual rollercoaster ride of raunch .  and while this uproariously funny , gross-out summer movie is basically an exercise in bad taste , it also demonstrates a surprising sweetness in the end .  american pie is the latest entry to the offensive teenage-targeted fare this season .  i must question the studio that releases a movie like this .  the producers are aiming these films at the 15-24 crowd , but while pushing the limit of possible sex and violence in an r-rated film .  some have even been narrowly avoiding the dreaded nc-17 , a rating the mpaa gives when the adult content surpasses even that of a restricted movie .  american pie was threatened with an nc-17 , but after snipping a few scenes from the finished product , it was given an r . but at least this new addition is not as careless and unforgiving as something like south park .  it is sick , perverse , and ultimately disgusting - not to mention extremely funny .  american pie is about four desperate teenagers who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night .  jim ( jason biggs ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) , oz ( chris klein ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) are a quartet of high school students in their senior year who think sex is something they must experience to be successful in their lives ahead .  jim inquires what it feels like when you reach third base , to which one of his friends replies : `like warm apple pie . . . ' .  of course , this prompts the scene unfairly exposed in the trailers , in which jim and a freshly baked pie have a very intimate moment in the kitchen corner .  there are many moments , such as this , in which director paul weitz uses a game-plan similar to the one frequently displayed in mary : to cause the audience to break down laughing in disgusting disbelief .  american pie is a hard-fought effort that has replenishing rewards if you manage to stick with it .  i loved the young cast in this movie .  consider the subject matter that these actors have dealt with , obviously suggestiveness never rivaled in any of their previous projects , and you should appreciate their performances .  biggs is more than enjoyable , and chris klein ( who recently played a similar jock in election ) is obviously a young talent on the rise .  but in a teen-dominated movie , the best performance comes from comedian eugene levy ( of television's sctv ) , who is unexpectedly brilliant as jim's uneasy father .  scenes in which the familiar father-son conversations are brought to interesting new levels are the funniest moments to be found in american pie .  after levy discovers jim's new use for apple pie , he tells him , `i did a fare share of that sort of thing when i was your age .  but i never used baked goods . '  it is performances such as his , and bill murray's in rushmore , that are often unfairly dismissed when awards are handed out .  there are some less-than-original aspects of the film .  a bathroom incident involving finch and a bottle of ex-lax is something we've seen before .  if weitz is planning to take after the farrelly brothers , then this is a decidedly unwise move : the same prank was pulled in the brother's dumb and dumber , and used to greater effect .  secondly , the characters are forced into a half-hearted climax that seems more artificial than amusing .  but at one point , in which we discover that american pie does have a heart of it's own , biggs asks his buddies why he's going through so much pressure for something that's `not very important anyway . '  and so we realize that while the film is expressive about a subject that is hardly appropriate , it still manages to be mature .  in it's own way .  |-0.2833333333333334|0.7833333333333333|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment of the text is mostly negative, with criticism directed towards the excessive and offensive sexual content in the movie ""American Pie"".

1|"albert brooks saves the day , just in the nick of time .  with a very poor summer for movies , brooks is just what audiences were looking for to cheer them up , and does so in a positive way .  while this may not be his finest work , "" the muse "" still shakes up some delightful humor .  in albert brook's latest comedy , he tells a story of a troubled screenwriter ( brooks ) who's losing his edge , as his business partners say .  in desperation , he goes to see his friend jack ( jeff bridges ) , who has been a very successful screenwriter in the past .  he asks jack for some help , and recieves word of a real life muse , that has helped him and many other directors throughout their career .  so brooks seeks the muse named sarah ( sharon stone ) , and is suckered into buying her expensive , food etc . as a sort of payment .  the real punch line however , doesn't come until the end .  it really makes you wonder , how screenwriters really get their ideas , could it simply be from a friend or a bum in the street ?  the idea itself is provoking and brooks does it in a hilarious manner .  speaking of brooks , he was absolutely hysterical as a screenwriter .  every time he graces the screen , i can't help but start laughing .  albert has a very unique sense of humor that makes him a very likeable character .  the real problem with the film lies with sharon stone .  she wasn't likeable at all .  brooks had the right idea with her occupation , but she never pulled through .  in a way , she drained energy from the once funny atmosphere and left it bleak .  luckily brooks could clean up the mess , and cover for stone's mishap .  it was a shame that the film went slightly downhill after her appearance , because "" the muse "" had the potential to a be a very authentic comedy .  on a brighter note , andie macdowell was also charming as brook's wife .  she is always a nice addition as a supporting actress , because she has that charisma that seems to complete the atmosphere to any film she's in .  the funniest moments in "" the muse "" in my opinion were the cameos by james cameron and martin scorsese .  i mean imagine , brooks seeing these big named directors in his back yard seeking sharon stone for advice , like it was something out of the ordinary .  it was just plain hilarious .  it just adds to the satire joke , of how directors get ideas .  brilliant move by brooks .  as i mentioned before , the film is a satire much like it's proceeder bowfinger , which came out a few weeks before .  unlike bowfinger , this is not a mean spirited film that's desperate for jokes , it's rather a witty and humorous look at hollywood .   "" bowfinger "" had it's moments , but had quite a few problems that were never worked out , but "" the muse "" still managed to keep the laughs despite a bit of a detour .  by the end of the film , you're glad to see a good hearty comedy come out of it .  for once i'm not fully disappointed , because the film didn't slow down , it kept moving , even with some flaws .  thumbs up to brooks for his brave effort .  i think he'll still manage to keep his edge around well into the future .

1|"for more than a decade , anjelica huston has been one of america's finest actresses .  in her directorial debut , bastard out of carolina , based upon dorothy allison's largely autobiographical book on child abuse and poverty in the south , huston displays impressive proficiency behind the camera as well .  the film tells the story of ruth anne boatwright , nicknamed bone by one of her uncles at birth , in post-world war ii south carolina .  through voice-over ( narration done by laura dern ) , we find that she nearly didn't survive birth , as her single mother anney , played by jennifer jason leigh , was thrown through the windshield during an automobile accident .  that's just the beginning of her troubles .  bone is deemed illegitimate on her birth certificate , a social stigma which her mother and her large poor family obsesses over for years to come .  anney meets and weds lyle , a kind man and good stepfather whom gives bone a baby sister before dying in an automobile accident .  anney's brother earle , played by michael rooker , introduces her to glen , played by ron eldard , a co-worker at the mill .  glen , the black sheep of a wealthy family ( "" when are you gonna make your daddy proud ?  i'll tell you when - never ! ""  he's told ) and filled with bitterness , courts anney and eventually wins her , despite warnings of a violent temper .  when anney miscarries with his much-prized baby boy , glen loses his capability to supress his violent outbursts and begins to direct them at bone , beating and abusing her , while the love-dependent anney tries to turn a blind eye and justify his behaviour .  things turn for the worse when glen loses his job and the family of four sink into impoverishment .  while set several decades ago , this story remains completely relevant in today's society , where abused wives return to their husbands , and abuse committed against children by one spouse is routinely overlooked by the other .  the real star of this domestic drama is not top-billed jennifer jason leigh , but child actress jena malone , who plays bone in a wrenching and wholly impressive debut performance .  her work is of award-calibre , and in this age in which a preponderence of superb child performers have emerged ( kirsten dunst , tina majorino , anna paquin , natalie portman , christina ricci , elijah wood ) , malone's performance stands up well .  leigh's performance in bastard out of carolina is fine , although she's not really given much to do , and ron eldard work is very solid , skillfully manouvering his character's moods in and out of explosive rage .  one can always sense that underneath his glen is a pressure-cooker ticking away .  of the supporting cast , special note must be made of the criminally underrated michael rooker's performance .  there's a bit too much generic formulaism in the screenplay for my taste , from the various characters spouting off country bumpkinisms , to the familiar sight of a dried-up uptight wise old granny ( played by grace zabriskie ) sitting on the porch rocking chair , to impassioned soliloquies better suited for a stage performance .  still , it cannot be denied that anne meredith's screenplay contains a wallop of emotional power .  huston's direction of the film is surehanded and impressive , giving the film good pacing and eliciting good performances from her cast , particularly the young malone .  her sequences of child abuse are shot in a hard-hitting emotional , rather than graphic , manner , and are very effective .  huston's talent with camera positioning is wonderful , from a visually striking shot done through a fan , to an extended sequence in the front seat of an automobile .  the film has the toned-down feel of a television production ; bastard out of carolina was originally composed and cut for broadcast on the tnt cable station , who ended up declining the film due to sentiments that scenes of abuse and rape in the film were too disturbingly realistic for their audience .  perhaps some sequences of the film may be unpleasant , but as a whole bastard out of carolina adds up to a powerful viewer experience worth seeing .

1|razor blade smile running as part of the vancouver international film festival played october 2nd and 4th , 1998 .  official release : halloween  reviewed by vince yim  `you think you know all about vampires . . . believe  me . . . you  know f * ck all . '  with these words , we are brought into the world of a sultry vampire seductress by the name of lilith silver ( played by eileen daly ) .  made into an immortal a century and a half ago by the sinister ethan blake , she continues to alleviate boredom with her state of being .  so , what's an undead girl to do , except squeeze into the tightest fitting clothes possible , get out her guns , seduce a few guys , and kill a few people for money and blood ?  with that out of the way , let me say this .  this film is bad .  this film is really , really bad .  yet somehow , it is strangely enjoyable .  with all the elements of a direct to video horror flick ? buxom babes , gore , cheesy dialogue , and bad acting ? any casual film viewer would be more inclined to spend their money on renting innocent blood or going to see blade .  still , it is considered to be one of the finest british vampire film .  agreed , it might be , but is far from being the best vampire flick ever .  period .  razor blade smile has some rather high production values , shown by the nice overall tone to the film .  the film is also a bit of a departure from popular vampire lore , with a vampire that can go out in broad daylight without disintegrating , doesn't sleep in a coffin ( but leaves one next to her computer ) , and sees religion as the `opium of the peoples' ( hence , immunity to crosses ) .  but aside from that , it doesn't stray too far away from horror film conventions .  that is , unless that is intentional .  razor blade smile literally goes for the throat , then pumps the wound full of processed cheese .  you can't help but laugh when a female vampire gets decapitated and her severed head goes flying into a puddle .  you'll laugh even harder at the hideously contrived situations ( to distract two female guards , lilith tosses a cellular phone towards them and dials the number ) .  you'll laugh the hardest when a murder witness recants the tale and suddenly starts sobbing uncontrollably .  and then , there's the sudden twist ending ( i have enough heart not to give it away ) .  the film refuses to take itself seriously , which is a good thing , as by the time lilith zips up her skin-tight body suit and then unzips it just to show the right amount of cleavage , you've most likely forgotten the main point of the story .  but in case you really care , she's been assigned to kill a bunch of people who belong to the so-called illuminati , and she's leaving a huge mess behind for the police to find .  as much as my criticisms , this movie works best as a guilty pleasure or as a film that you watch with your friends and within groups .  almost destined for cult-status , the film's campy , cheesy overtones actually work towards the film .  while this may not necessarily be the film you'd want to be seen watching by yourself , it makes for a fun time at the movies .  |-0.31666666666666665|0.8166666666666668|0.85|The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly positive, with reviewers noting that the film is strangely enjoyable and has high production values, but also criticizing it for being bad and cheesy.

1|"seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) .  when it comes to modern gangster movies , it's really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word "" routine . ""  i've always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it's been used before ) can provide for a good story and "" donnie brasco "" clinches this idea .  it's not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another's style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale .  the film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it .  we meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk .  he and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this .  somehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn't afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him .  it's clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade .  i have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit .  however , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer .  the first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to .  the screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original .  most gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable .  thankfully the film doesn't become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development .  much of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie .  pacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would .  he's old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be .  we learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it's easy to sympathize with him .  newell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run .  as donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it's hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed .  most of the film tells the story of donnie's life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn't always seem to come together as a whole .  the storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar .  the resonance to donnie's actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn't always seem to have much meaning .  back home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he's never a and the family is suffering .  since this is based on a true story i wouldn't doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic .  my only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure .  a climax of sorts does occur , but there's little feeling of a payoff .  we get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful .  aside from a few minor , general flaws , "" donnie brasco "" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development .  it may be routine , but it's good , and that's respectful .

""  indeed .  and any filmmaker with a three hour movie who ends it with that gem of dialogue should expect to see it quoted in a review .  on a more positive note , let me add that sometimes the green mile is almost good enough to make us forget its length .  the mile in question ( green due to its faded lime-colored linoleum ) leads from the prison cell to "" old sparky , "" the electric chair where executions were carried out at louisiana's cold mountain penitentiary in 1935 .  paul edgecomb ( tom hanks , you've got mail ) is the head guard of e-block , otherwise known as death row .  keeping his prisoners calm as they await the carrying out of their sentence is his primary responsibility .  it is a responsibility which he capably delegates to the other guards on his watch by insisting they "" talk to "" the convicts instead of yelling at them .  this practice leads to an unusual camaraderie between the guards and the men behind their bars .  into his charge comes one john coffey ( michael clarke duncan , armageddon ) , a seven foot tall gentle giant who has been convicted of the rape and murder of two young girls .  immediately , paul senses something different about this prisoner .  perhaps its the way he asked for a night light because he is frightened of the dark .  or perhaps it is the mystical healing powers he demonstrates as he "" takes back "" paul's bladder infection thereby restoring him to health .  based on steven king's 1996 serialized novel , the green mile does offer other characters who have stories to be told : eduard delacroix ( michael jeter , patch adams ) , is a frail cajun convict who befriends and trains a mouse to do circus tricks ; percy wetmore ( doug hutchison , a time to kill ) , is a young and sadistic guard sitting on a transfer to a more lucrative position because he has yet to see a prisoner "" fry "" up close ; and hal moores ( james cromwell , babe : pig in the city ) is the compassionate warden for whom , despite all the executions he's witnessed , death never loomed as large as when his own wife was diagnosed with a tumor .  while it is mr . hanks "" everyman "" performance at the center of the film which gives it the anchor to hold our interest for 180 minutes , it is the performances of his supporting cast that are most worth noting .  all involved do credible work in their respective roles , most especially mr . duncan , who turns in an impressive , fully realized characterization .  if only the story were more credible .  writer/director frank darabont ( the shawshank redemption ) has crafted a flawed fantasy/allegory of sorts ; one which is more spiritualistic than spiritual , relying on a preternatural mysticism rather than a genuine and godly spiritual power .  mr . darabont also overplays his hand considerably in the manipulation of our affection towards and association with his characters .  was it an accidental omission that the first two inmates who walked the green mile were being punished for crimes never disclosed ?  by not knowing the reason for the condemned convicts' presence on e-block , the audience never gets the sense of the justice which is being carried out , making the death penalty appear cruel and unwarranted .  this is especially true during the gruesome depiction of the second execution which was horribly botched .  much has also been made of coffey's christ-like ability to heal but unlike the numerous healings which are recorded in the scriptures , coffey's powers are shrouded in mystery , taking on the feel of a circus trick , coupled with a voodoo-like "" i feel your pain "" transference .  in contrast , there is no mystery associated with the healing that is from god .  the genuine "" gifts of healing "" listed in 1 corinthians 12 is just one of the nine manifestations of holy spirit and can be operated by any spiritually instructed man or woman in accordance with the knowledge and wisdom of god .  true spiritual healing ( with few exceptions ) requires the committed believing of both the healer as well as the one being healed .  such believing comes not from the shrouded secrets of mysticism , but from the revealed word of god .

1|"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .   "" all the world's a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts "" - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7  when william shakespeare penned this passage , he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash .  this is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show .  truman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life .  he has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise .  or so it would seem .  bizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman's life .  a lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky .  a rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term 'isolated' follows him around .  a radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move .  for the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be .  the truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next .  balancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy .  in many ways , mr . niccol's screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea .  although the film's rather conventional climax doesn't sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception .  despite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible .  the tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false .  the end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs .  the system formula .  while the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking .  the device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman's growing awareness isn't exactly convincing .  there's not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film .  in fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman's artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling .  still , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city .  i've always believed that the versatile ms . linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans .  cheerfully going over the top , it's hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she'd have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ?  ms . linney is a delight in the film .  but it is mr . carrey who rules the show here .  he may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it's difficult not to root for truman .  in a commanding performance , mr . carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there's an early scene where he's down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr . carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags .  it's almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who's constantly the centre of attention .  in addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman's antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz's original score .  technical credits are first-rate all around .  while the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film , it's not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965's secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner .  all the same , this is a visionary , award-calibre film : entertaining , provocative , and intelligent .  the curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film's concept seems unfathomably outrageous , it's abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching , if not actualisation , at least permissiveness of such a scenario .  perhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question .  perhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world .

1|"in chocolat , a chocolate shop owner tells her customers to look into a spinning object of obscure textures , patterns , and lines , hoping she'll be able to foresee the kind of chocolate they'll most enjoy .  some scoff the idea , but everyone who gazes into the complexity of the spinning object winds up seeing something different than the next , revealing personality traits which the person may not have known they had before .  this can easily stand as a model for chocolat as a whole : on the surface , it appears to be a light , fluffy fable with no depth or true worth , but when one takes a second , deeper look , chocolat's true colors begin to shine through .  making a bold statement about organized religion and those who practice it , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is flawlessly acted and meticulously crafted-not to mention one of the best films of the year .  what gives chocolat its magic , much like hallstrom's 1999 winner of two academy awards , the cider house rules , is its willingness to say what's on its mind without holding back to prevent offending audiences .  the bold and honest message hallstrom conveys with chocolat will no doubt outrage a select group of viewers , but those who are willing to suspend their bitterness because they feel they are being intimidated or attacked should find themselves to be in agreement with what the film says about narrow-mindedness .  chocolat centers its story around the small french village of lansquenet , where majority rules , and the majority lives by only one law : religion .  the bulk of the townspeople ( with few exceptions ) are preparing for the sacred time of abstinence , lent , but when the independent thinking , seemingly non-religious vianne rocher ( juliette binoche ) and her daughter anouk ( victoire thivisol ) make the village their home , the people will be tempted beyond belief by the mouth-watering confections in the chocolate shop vianne opens .  many are predictably opposed and deeply offended by vianne's opening of the chocolate shop just in time for lent , especially the mayor , comte de reynaud ( a cartoon-like alfred molina ) , who will stop at nothing to put her out of business .  on the other hand , the shop is a delight to others , including the cranky armande voizin ( judi dench ) , who sits day by day in vianne's shop , telling the single mother about her unfortunate detached relationship with her grandson ( aurelien parent-koening ) , which comes as a result of his mother ( carrie-ann moss ) believing armande is a bad influence , as she does not hold the same , strict religious beliefs that she does .  also a fan of the chocolate is the nervous wreck josephine muscat , whose husband is constantly beating her , to whom vianne offers a home and befriends .  juliette binoche is charming and honest as vianne , genuinely capturing her character's determination to turn the narrow-minded townspeople into more happy , independent human beings , but most of chocolat's success is unquestionably a result of the remarkable performances of the supporting actresses .  lena olin , previously nominated for an oscar in 1989 , deserves her second nomination for her earnest , moving portrayal of a lost , scared woman torn between staying true to her battering , manipulative husband or leaving him to live the life which for which she longs .  judi dench is sharp , incisive , and occasionally greatly touching as armande voizin .  carrie ann-moss , in what is likely to be her first largely noticed ( and acclaimed ) role since the matrix , shows a more solid side of her acting skills not previously seen , crafting a character that the viewer both sympathizes with and despises simultaneously .  victoire thivisol shows much promise as anouk , a young girl hoping her always-on-the-move mother will eventually settle down .  a trade ad for chocolat sums up best the power the actresses have on screen with the tagline : "" five extraordinary women , one extraordinary movie . ""  that's not to say the men don't do their share , though : alfred molina makes for a sly and utterly repugnant antagonist , hugh o'conor adds quite a bit of comic relief as the priest who seems to not even know why he is who he is , and johnny depp gives a strong performance as the pirate roux , who enters the film late in the game and sparks the romantic interest of vianne .  the technical aspects of chocolat are strong across the board : lasse hallstrom directs his enchanting fable with great care , perfectly balancing the elements of each genre to be found within the film .  cinematographer roger pratt brings an atmospheric , fairy tale look to the film , and rachel portman's masterful score is her best and most memorable since the cider house rules .  chocolat , adapted by robert nelson jacobs from the joanne harris novel , is a wonderful little treat of a film , one that will most likely win over the hearts of audiences and the votes of academy members this winter , and the aggressive backing of miramax films assures the latter .  while not as powerful as the cider house rules , lasse hallstrom's chocolat is a film which works on all levels-as a drama , a comedy , a fable , a romance , and a fairy tale .  and it even lives up to its name : it is delicious to savor the taste of , easy to digest , and , like all excellent chocolate , it is memorable for days afterward .  the bottom line : chocolat is pure pleasure .

1|"assume nothing .  the phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990's , as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be .  the phrase especially goes for oscar novak , an architect who is the main focus of three to tango , a delightful , funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself .  novak ( matthew perry ) , a shy , clumsy , chicago based architect , along with openly gay partner , peter steinberg ( oliver platt ) , fights for projects day in and day out .  one of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman ( dylan mcdermott ) , a rich , well-known businessman .  charles immediately takes a liking to oscar , as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor .  seeing oscar as someone he could trust , charles asks him to watch his girlfriend , an unpredictable , adventurous girl named amy post ( neve campbell ) , who makes a living by blowing glass .  charles wants to know who she talks to , what she does , and where she goes .  the point ?  to make sure she's not seeing someone else , of course .  oscar gladly takes the job , and meets amy at an art show of hers , and sparks fly between the two from the get go .  oscar feels he has found the one meant for him , and he is content with the idea of being with amy .  well , another popular phrase of the 90's is "" all good things must come to an end , "" and this stays true for oscar as well .  charles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night , as oscar and amy have become great friends , but he doesn't seem to mind .  why is this ?  he thinks oscar is gay .  he's not afraid to share this with him either .  oscar stands in shock after the words , "" i swear if you weren't gay oscar , i'd have to kill you , "" are muttered flamboyantly from charles' mouth .  the word spreads instantly through town .  will oscar "" come out "" of his supposed gayness , or will he tell everyone that he isn't ?  one would immediately think he would deny the fact , but numerous occurrences come to oscar , which result in the fact that if he denies the fact , he could lose his job with charles .  matthew perry doesn't escape his character as chandler on the already classic t . v .  comedy "" friends , "" as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless , shy , and sensitive .  nonetheless , perry is hilarious here , and shows that he can handle drama , as obviously , his character suffers quite a bit here .  it's wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie , ( she was the star of scream 1 and 2 , and the upcoming scream 3 ) as she handles comedy superbly here .  her voice , smile , and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies- stay with this genre , neve .  neve is delightful as her conflicted character , who feels love for oscar , but knows , based on rumors , that he is gay .  as usual , campbell is likable as her likable character .  unlike the other two leads here , dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue , and is never convincing .  when his character his present , mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting .  stick to the t . v .  drama , the practice , dylan .  the major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano .  no originality or technique is used whatsoever .  three to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy , or else the film would have been a disaster , as it is just plain boring to look at .  three to tango is a film done many times before , as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998's the object of my affection , but the plot has never been completed so well .  three to tango's script , written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun , fast , and funny , delivering not only original , hilarious gay jokes ( not your run of the mill material ) , but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling .  unlike last summer's south park : bigger , longer , and uncut and 1997's in & out , three to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar .  the script is wise to take this route , as gays can't ( i don't think so , anyway ) be offended by this light , playful comedy .   ( to prove this , a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly . )  three to tango's climax is a hilarious , clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romantic-mistaken identity comedies .  three to tango is a gem .  the bottom line : three to tango is a light , sharp , snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending , and great stars .  one of the better romantic comedies of 1999 .

1|the question isn't why has grease been reissued .  the answer to that one is easy : to celebrate the movie's 20th anniversary and to make more bucks for paramount's coffers because john travolta is once again a hot commodity .  no , the question that ought to be asked is : should grease be reissued ?  the answer is not an easy one .  grease is a fun movie , an entertaining fantasy of the '50s , embodying all the cliches of that era .  the music is lively and the dance numbers , choreographed by patricia birch , are energetic and high-spirited .  travolta was at his pinnacle as a sexual icon , cool , but non-threatening .  but grease didn't break any new cinematic ground .  it was not a milestone in movie history such as citizen kane or easy rider .  what grease is - or has become - is the highest-grossing musical in film history .  ok , let's not be a spoilsport .  grease is a fun and entertaining movie , even though it stretches credulity to see such performers as travolta , olivia newton-john , taxi's jeff conaway and the multi-talented stockard channing try to act like high schoolers .  it's nostalgic to recall how good a dancer travolta was , and it's sad to think of what could have been had not a few missteps sidetracked his career .  he could have become a musical comedy star in the tradition of gene kelly .  cinematically , the musical comedy has basically gone the way of the dinosaur .  between grease and 1996's evita . , you can probably count the number of movie musicals on one hand .  two reasons have contributed to the demise of the genre : the first is that movie audiences have become more sophisticated , no , make that cynical and jaded .  today , if a character began to dance and sing with no orchestra in sight , he or she would probably be hooted off the screen .  today's audiences lack the innocence , that belief in movie magic that is required for a musical to succeed .  secondly , a lack of talent .  performers with the charisma , the style , the larger-than-life panache of fred astaire , gene kelly , ginger rogers and judy garland are gone .  most singers and dancers remain on the stage , and those who do succeed in movies usually wind up in serious dramatic parts .  a good example is gregory hines , one of the greatest dancers in the world .  he danced a bit in the cotton club , tap and white nights , but those were essentially dramatic vehicles .  so , perhaps the reissue of grease can serve a purpose .  if audiences show enough interest , meaning if the re-release earns the studio enough revenue , it may spark a revival in movie musicals .  perhaps not original musicals such as singin' in the rain , an american in paris or seven brides for seven brothers , but for broadway properties that have been in the planning stages for film adaptations for several years .  at one time or another , according to the industry rumor mill , hollywood has been set to create an animated version of andrew lloyd webber's cats , a filming of the popular phantom of the opera as well as les miserables and chicago , the latter reportedly to star madonna .  so , let this grease be the forerunner of an armada of movie musicals .  let grease be the word that sparks this revival .  |0.13333333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.8166666666666668|The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly positive with some discussions on the decline of the musical comedy genre and the nostalgia for John Travolta's talent.

""  the from dusk till dawn dialogue is 100% tarantino , hovering between absurd and disgusting ( as when they're entering the nightclub and cheech marin announces the main attractions of the titty twister ) , but always entertaining , and is a huge reason the movie is so much fun to watch instead of being one more second-rate gorefest .  clooney , keitel and especially tarantino are so over-the-top with their delivery that the dialogue is that much more hilarious , ensuring not one second of from dusk till dawn is taken the least bit seriously .  stuff like this would be terrible in any other movie , but tarantino and rodriguez know exactly what to do to entertain people , even if there's absolutely no message or meaning to from dusk till dawn .  pulp fiction had the vulgarity and violence for a reason , but this movie just throws it out for cheap entertainment .  from dusk till dawn isn't the classic of modern cinema that pf is , but is does prove you can do a good job making a really bad movie .

1|"warren beatty's "" bulworth "" is a caustic political comedy that doesn't attack any particular political group , but rather the ingrained insincerity that has infected the american political system .  some might think this film is vulgar , and in many ways it is .  however , as loud and raucous as it is , "" bulworth "" speaks the truth , which is almost always ugly to hear .  beatty , who directed the film and co-wrote the script with jeremy pikser ( "" the lemon sisters "" ) , stars as incumbent u . s . senator jay billington bulworth , who has one of the best politician names in cinema history .  bulworth is a democrat , and in beatty's view , he is symbolic of everything that has gone wrong with the current democratic party .  once an ideological liberal ( like beatty still is ) , bulworth has long since succumbed to the materialistic pressures of washington .  instead of waging the battles for the impoverished and the downtrodden , which was once the calling card of democrats , bulworth has become another sell-out money hound - if he's not accepting illegal bribes from the insurance lobby or taking campaign contributions from the chinese , he's making wind-bag speeches that start with the amusingly clintonesqe statement , "" america is standing on the doorstep of a new millennium . . . .  blah , blah , blah . ""  when the film opens , it is a few days before the 1996 primary elections , and bulworth is sitting at his desk weeping because he realizes how corrupt he has become .  in a fit of desperation , he takes out a $10 million life insurance policy from a dirty insurance rep played by paul sorvino ( part of a shady lobby deal to kill a threatening bill in committee ) , and then hires a hit man to kill him , although he doesn't know who the assassin will be , or when the hit will take place .  knowing that he will soon be dead , bulworth unleashes his own brand of political rhetoric on the world , which is made up of politically incorrect truths about the state of american politics and the society in general .  at a compton church , he tells the group of african-americans that they will have no power in the u . s . unless they "" put down that malt liquor and chicken wings , and get behind somebody other than a running back who stabs his wife . ""  later , in a particularly hilarious sequence , bulworth mixes with the hollywood elite , then insults the quality of their movies and informs them that the only reason he's there is because "" my guys always put the big jews on my schedule . ""  all throughout this physically and politically suicidal escapade , bulworth's chief of staff , dennis murphy ( oliver platt ) , follows behind in a state of constant shock and bewilderment .  platt has some of the movie's funniest scenes , as he makes murphy into a politically savvy but nonetheless clueless assistant who is forced to watch his own career teeter at the brink of being flushed down the toilet .  his constant half-truth-telling and spin-doctoring to cover bulworth's stampede is equaled in its perversion only by a self-righteous reporter ( nora dunn ) who acts like murphy's refusal to explain bulworth's actions ( something he really cannot do ) is somehow an act of treason .  when bulworth decides he wants to live after all , and therefore must constantly evade a grim-looking assassin to be who's trailing him at every turn , he hides out in the ghetto , complete with a stereotypical gangsta wardrobe which he wears to one of his television interviews .  at this point , beatty abandons much of the political aspect and dives into a cartoonish exploration of the black inner-city experience .  bulworth becomes friendly with a young black woman named nina ( halle berry ) , who he meets at the harlem church rally .  she has a tough-talking brother who is deep in debt to a local gangster named l . d .   ( don cheadle of "" boogie nights "" ) , who also becomes involved in bulworth's campaign .  some of the scenes in the ghetto ring true , but much of it feels like a lighter version of scenes depicted in more intense inner-city films like "" boyz'n'hood "" ( 1991 ) and "" menace ii society "" ( 1993 ) .   "" bulworth's "" chief liability is beatty's insistence on having his character adopt a clumsy style of rap as his new communication device .  instead of speaking at political rallies , he breaks into a kind of rhythmless rap style that is a reminder of why almost all hip-hop stars are black .  it's hard to tell whether beatty is being humorous by being so bad , or whether he's actually that incompetent .  at any rate , the rap sounds more run d . m . c .  than snoop doggy dogg , which makes the film seem dated instead of contemporary .  beatty would have been better off simply adopting some of the inner-city lingo and working that into his speeches , instead of trying to sound like l . l . cool j .  other than that , "" bulworth "" hits all its targets with wry , hilarious accuracy .  the film is like a letter bomb to the democratic party , and even if you don't agree with beatty's liberal message about the unrequited duties of the federal government , it is hard to deny the impact the film has in exploring the monetary and moral debauchery that infests modern politics .  unlike "" primary colors "" which opened earlier this year , "" bulworth "" doesn't try to tip-toe around the truly painful issues that hit close to home - instead , it takes them dead-on .

1|"when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time .  while i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good .  i'm happy to say that there's something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs .  in fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours .  the film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island .  ted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can't seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w .  earl brown ) , who's being harassed by one of the school jocks .  it seems warren's sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted's willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up .  mary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom .  ted was just flattered that she even knew his name .  unfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital .  fast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn't seen since that fateful day .  with the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love .  however , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections .  there's something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin .  not exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them .  with their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you'll not only enjoy , but also won't mind talking about the next day at the water cooler .  the film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers' last two films ) they almost all work .  i have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on .  one minute you'll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you'll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary's apartment .  one of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller .  he is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he's a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation .  ted's a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don't always work out .  it's comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top .  actually , i've liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties .  the film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money .  in it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler .  it was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived "" the ben stiller show "" on the fox network in late '92/early '93 .  like "" the critic "" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show's cancellation .  cameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times .  however , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she's got guys just falling over each other to be with her .  heck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week .  my girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn't change , and you know , it's really true .  he and ralph macchio must hang out or something .  maybe they live in dick clark's pool house .  anyway , here's another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary's heart .  the supporting performances are also good .  chris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy .  lin shae , who plays mary's neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film .  lee evans , as mary's friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist .  the farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren't any noticeable times where the film drags .  the only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes .  they appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera .  it's a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film .  after that it got a little annoying , and it's unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow .  fortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous lines , and solid comedic acting , there's something about mary will still have you laughing after you leave the theater .

( "" look into my eyes ! "" )  in fact , the last time that i've seen a guy so scared in a movie was john turturro in that forest scene from the coen brothers' miller's crossing .  scary shite .  but there's an ever better scene than that in this film .  this one features bettany , once again , slowly torturing , hacking and beating the living piss out of a rival gangster ( from that man's point-of-view ) , but not before turning on a quaint little tune in the background and removing all of his own expensive clothes , one by one ( that's right , he "" does "" the guy in his underwear ) .  that scene is also in tune with some of the obvious phallic and homoerotic undertones present throughout this film , especially in the relationship between bettany and his boss ( why does he get so upset when he falls in love with that woman ? ) .  but the flick's not perfect .  in fact , i didn't mind malcolm mcdowell's voice-over narration at first , but as the film grew into a major flashback ( most of the film is presented as such ) , he came in every now and then , and rarely added anything of interest to the plot .  all he seemed to do was swear and call people the c-word umpteen times , and even described one scene as it was happening ( "" . . . so  i opened the door , then went up the lift , etc . . . . "" -it's  like , yeah , i know that already , i could see it on the screen ! !  overdone . ) .  i also didn't quite "" buy "" the ending of the movie , which despite being original , seemed a little unbelievable , especially when you consider that it's supposed to be taking place 30 years later , and folks still seem to be holding grudges , still in love , still living in the same apartments ? ? ! ?  i mean , c'mon . . . it's 30 years , man ! !  i don't know , somehow it didn't work all that well for me .  but one of my favorite genres has always been the crime movies , and this one is a decent addition to the lot .  forget the lame title and malcolm mcdowell's narration of the obvious plot points , and concentrate on the film's stronger attributes such as its style , the exquisite atmosphere of the time period , its original look at the gangster dynamic within the same group , its memorable sequences and the solid performances from its two main leads , bettany and thewlis .  incidentally , unlike a few of the gangster flicks that i mention below , this one is in no way a parody or homage to this genre of films . . . it's the real deal !  note : this film is packed with strong accents all around , which makes it hard to make out some of the words from time to time .  it's also quite violent and i don't remember any film that used the c-word as much as this one , so leave the kids at home for this one . . .   ; )  where's joblo coming from ?  american psycho ( 10/10 ) - a clockwork orange ( 9/10 ) - donnie brasco ( 8/10 ) - fight club ( 10/10 ) - get carter ( 7/10 ) - godfather ( 10/10 ) - godfather ii ( 10/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ) - lock , stock & two smoking barrels ( 8/10 ) - pulp fiction ( 8/10 ) - reservoir dogs ( 9/10 )  "|0.7333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|0.9666666666666667|The movie receives overall positive sentiment, with praise for its unique and serious-minded approach to the British gangster genre, authentic portrayal, strong performances, style, atmosphere, and memorable sequences, although there are some minor drawbacks such as an annoying voice-over and unsatisfying ending.

( his initial conversations with hopkins sound shockingly like hannibal lecter . . . )  and the ultimate resolution to one of the film's supernatural problems seems , well , somewhat superficial .  still , even with the film's length , it was a pleasant time at the movies , something you wouldn't necessarily expect from a film about death . . . but one which meet joe black delivers anyhow .
