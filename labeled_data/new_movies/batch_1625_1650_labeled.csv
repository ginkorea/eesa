0|" "" tina ! ! ! fetch me the axe ! ! ! ""  a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981 , paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands .  it wasn't just the film's disappointing box office performance .  indeed , in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two , three , even six times .  no , the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year .  in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events , some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming : "" mommie dearest : the biggest mommie of them all ! "" .  executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn , but it was all too late .  mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history .  unfortunately , faye dunaway's energetic , at times ridiculously over-the-top performance is about the film's only redeeming feature .  based on daughter christina crawford's trashy biography , mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother .  if you believe this movie , it was a life was racked by obsession , lonliness , child abuse and rampant egomania .  the film begins with crawford adopting two children , and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown-up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother's will .  joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves , you see .  but that's about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film's end .  the script - laboured over by four writers , a bad sign in itself - is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum .  frank perry's direction is no more than competent , and dunaway's bitchy lines aside , the dialogue is flat and uninvolving .  in fairness , the film's second half ditches some of the cartoon hysterics and does develop a degree empathy for its characters .  when the adult christina moves out of home into her own modest dwelling , joan visits and keeps in touch , not helping her financially but encouraging christina's own acting and career ambitions .  crawford does seem to care about her daughter , but you can sense the emotional distance and feel some of their pain .  you also get glimpses of what the film could have been in the hands of better writers .  ah , but there is dunaway's performance .  and what a delicious piece of campery it often is .  having just been sacked by her studio after a run of box office duds , crawford storms home late at night and proceeds to go ballistic in the garden .  she has the maid drag the kids out of bed to come down and clean up the mess she's making .  spotting a young tree she doesn't like the look of , she turns to the trembling christina and utters the immortal line "" tina ! !  fetch me the axe ! ! ""  with which she proceeds to enthusiastically dismember the poor sapling .  in the film's most outrageous scene , joan realises that some of her daughter's clothes are hanging on wire coat hangers .  oh dear !  sounds like the perfect excuse for another temper tantrum , doesn't it ?  this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst : "" no . . . wire . . . hangers . . . . ever ! ! ! ! "" .  and later , when the board of her late husband's company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship , she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring : "" don't fuck with me , fellas ! ! "" .  oh joy !  something of a camp classic , then , but if that's not you're cup of tea then mommie dearest doesn't have too much to recommend it .  better you see the real crawford in the women ( 1939 ) , mildred pierce ( 1945 ) or whatever happened to baby jane ( 1962 ) .  great films distinguished by great performances , and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perry's shrieking piece of tabloid froth .

0|"writer/director lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s .  yes , that's right , he co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) , the empire strikes back ( 8 . 5/10 ) and return of the jedi ( 8/10 ) .  now with this film , it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing .  and guess what ?  he succeeds once again !  plot : a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town , where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open-armed swarm of people with problems .  it isn't long before he befriends the small-town billionaire , folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients .  critique : this film is not a comedy !  it is a drama .  i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer , you would think that this film secures its base in humor , but unfortunately for us , it does not .  it is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me , but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake , but overall , just sits there .  now on to my review .  this movie sucks because it was slow and boring , starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past , included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst , and certified it all with many a predictable ending .  i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture , but whatever it was . . . he  missed !  anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff-piece , which on a good day , might be described as predictably digestible .  it's no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy !  it sucks as a drama , and bored my movie cohort right to sleep .  i've given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks .  first of all , i couldn't help but think about how much the lead actor , loren dean , looked like a young charles grodin .  he even acted like him , save for the dry , sardonic wit .  this kept me interested in watching him at least .  number two , and this one is really shallow ( seemed to be geared that way as well ) , there were quite a few "" titshots "" , as they would say back in high school .  and god help me if i can't get enough of those in an aimless drama .  and three , and this one surprised me the most , actor ted danson's cameo ( yes , he will always be sam malone to us real fans ! ) was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person .  a different asshole , but a different person nonetheless .  if ever you rent this movie one day ( promise you won't throw away your hard-earned money at the theaters ? ! ) ,  wait for his scene because it's actually pretty good .  other than that , drab , drab , drab and drab .  even jason lee , a personal favorite of mine , was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while .  well , at least he finally "" came out "" and did some real skateboarding in this movie !  oh yeah , and i guess that's the fourth point in my rating .  anyway , if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist . . . this  film's your bag !  otherwise , skip it and see analyze this ( 8/10 ) again . . . now  there's a great shrink movie !  little known facts about this film and its stars : "" three's company "" fans alert ! ! !  terri from the tv show , also known as actress priscilla barnes , plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film .  the scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage , so stay tuned , kids !  also , it is to note that the actress was once named "" penthouse pet of the month "" in march of 1976 .  she was known as one joann witty back then .  she's originally from jersey .  who the hell is loren dean , the dude who plays mumford in this film ?  you got me , but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name .  jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971 .  he was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats ( 6/10 ) , and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp . he's been in every kevin smith film except for clerks ( 8 . 5/10 ) .  listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film ( the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince ) make a reference to the "" lost ark "" , which is obviously an in-joke , considering that it is the writer/director of this film , lawrence kasdan , who co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) .  kasdan also played the part of dr . green in 1997's as good as it gets ( 8/10 ) .  ted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdan's 1981 directorial debut body heat starring a sexy kathleen turner and william hurt .

( in a running gag , porter demands $70 000 , but everybody mishears him and assumes he's after the entire $130 000 haul . )  in his travels ( or travails ) , porter encounters several other one-named villainous cretins like fairfax ( james coburn as a white-haired , millionaire thief ) and carter ( kristofferson , as a brown-haired , millionaire thief-the kingpin of the obligatory "" operation "" ) .  helgeland's film ( which was recut by mel the producer ) is devoid of an imperative dime store charm .  the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly : a ) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs , and b ) because mel's schtick doesn't evolve from act one-he's the terminator stranded in a plot without a sci-fi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone .  payback should have been called playback : it's a 102-minute loop of the same short sequence .   ( mel : "" i want my money . ""  anonymous villain : "" no .

( director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello , so va-va-va-voom in permanant midnight , to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig . )  to analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention than it deserves .  perhaps only someone as experienced with antagonists-as-protagonists as tarantino-look what he did with the similar hero-less botched-robbery tale reservoir dogs-could have pulled off this material ( a loose remake of john boorman's point blank ) .  the movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction ( all women are femme fatales ; even the cops are in on it , etc . ) and crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas ( death is never in the cards for the main character , etc . ) but transcends neither .

0|"when you've run out of old tv shows to turn into movies , i guess you try video games .  why did i go to see mortal kombat : annihilation ?  the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw .  this film was a bunch of fighting , yelling , special effects , and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack .  the plot is fairly simple : a portal has opened between our world and the "" outworld "" , allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn ( brian thompson ) to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity .  the good guys , led by sorcerer rayden ( james remar ) and human mortal liu kang ( robin shou ) , must take the fight to outworld , where the fate of both worlds will be determined .  here's the catch : they must reunite princess katana ( talia soto ) , who's on the good side , with her resurrected mother queen sindel ( musetta vander ) , who's on the bad side , for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanity's safety for another generation .  how this is supposed to work , i still have no idea , but i liked katana's line , "" i knew love would keep us together , "" since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh .  there are some seriously stupid things in this movie .  take , for example , a transportation system which utilizes the "" inner winds "" , generated by earth's magma flows .  you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast .  how fast ?  as katana says , "" you will be moving so fast , it will be as if you are not moving at all . ""  what ?  later , sonya blade ( sandra hess ) goes to find jax ( lynn "" red "" williams , otherwise known as "" saber "" on tv's american gladiators ) at a medical research facility on the island of oahu .  how do we know this is where she went ?  there's a sign on the facility's perimeter fence that reads : medical research facility - oahu , hawaii .  remember , this is not a caption , but an actual sign .  i guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are .  there's a lot of major flipping action , too .  the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another .  do they land and immediately get into the fighting ?  does one of them land first and catch the other off guard ?  do they collide in mid-air ?  no , apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away .  why did they need those metal balls to travel ?  everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b .  i have to admit , the fight scenes are pretty good , although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires , allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics .  the movie's thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly .   "" ouch "" was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one .  you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights , not plot , would be the main draw , since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next .  it seems that's all there is in this movie .  maybe it is .  as i had mentioned , the acting is bad .  there's not one solid performance in the film , although williams as jax was pretty funny .  after a fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling , jax says , "" you look good in mud .  no , really , you do . ""  remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously , and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang .  brian thompson , who has played good guys , bad guys , and even an alien on tv's the x-files , but always some muscle-bound behemoth , is your average evil demi-god , but it's more the script's fault than his own that he doesn't have anything original to say .  the one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and a half .  another thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking , blood only appears in one scene .  all in all , mortal kombat : annihilation is loud , violent , shallow , and marketed toward kids .  hey , just like the video game !

0|"i didn't come into city of angels expecting greatness .  i've never seen wim wenders' wings of desire , the classic movie upon which city is loosely based .  then again , i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device , with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them , that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold .  unfortunately , city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them .  the plot , for those that couldn't tell from the previews , revolves around the angel seth , played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage , who , in the midst of his angelic duties , falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally ) .  of course , his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her , watch her buy groceries , only to disappear in the blink of an eye .  their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human .  using this framework as a jumping-off point , the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire , the joys of being human , and the definition of perfection .  the first half of the movie succeeds on most points .  cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesn't know feelings so can't really express , preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang-dog expressions .  unfortunately , cage takes the intensity too far sometimes , and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive .  as maggie , ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right .  her beauty , unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss , is mature , intelligent , and winning .  likewise , some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film .  when the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen , the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel .  the beautiful camera work , shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels , also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel .  the film begins to lose its way , though , when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie .  the grand , angelic perspective gets lost , except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angel's eyes .  the movie devolves into an examination of how seth can't feel the world or , more importantly , he can't feel maggie : he can't smell her hair , feel her touch , or taste the pears she eats .  this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seth's intense longing , but in doing so , the conflict disappears .  if he wants maggie so badly , then why doesn't her just make the leap and become human ?  after all , what's so great about being an angel ?  sure , you get to sit on marlboro signs , but what's that compared to getting to be with meg ryan ?  and from there , once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur , it's all downhill .  the philosophy becomes heavy-handed , the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep , and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audience's hankie .  it's the last thirty minutes of the movie , then , that wrecks the film .  i feel like the writer , by pulling out all the melodramatic stops , has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level .  i came out feeling robbed , seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing .  i could go on longer , but i don't want to "" ruin "" the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on .  city of angels , then , is a paradox .  it's a well-acted ( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type-casting as a happy-go-lucky fallen angel ) , well-filmed , and based on a wonderful idea .  all these possibilities , though , are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up .

0|"plot summary : the year is 2024 .  the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod .  the shield , although saving lives , has made the atmosphere hot and humid .  connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope .  on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a "" terrorist "" organisation .  they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up .  connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist ( like zeit--get it ? ) .  they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off .  he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland .  both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment .  connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield .  katana meanwhile , fearing connor would return , sets out himself to kill the highlander .  if you have never seen it .  being a fan of highlander and mr . connery , i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening .  i wish it had been quicker .  i feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music , etc . ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said .  the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so ( the time mr . connery is on the screen for ) is worth watching .  the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance .  maybe they could pull it off .  instead , i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film .  it's as if they are different people with the same names .  witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the attitude of "" who wants to live forever , when love must die "" gone to ?  the love sub-plot * must * have had footage cut out .  the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before .  putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying .  i still want to know why connor's coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal !  we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it , nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill .  why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck ?  i know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first .  to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the world's worst shot .  meanwhile connor develops luke-skywalker-like powers of laser beam deflection .  as for "" bad guys , "" we see a rebellion on zeist , crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist .  two assassins are sent , presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems .  no more assassins are sent .  katana , supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor .  has he no more assassins ?  has he no better ?  why was the rebellion crushed so easily then ?  michael ironside is totally unconvincing ( bring back the kurgan ) .  he seems like a cartoon character and really isn't that evil , just stupid and violent .  we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents .  yet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor , or maybe because his two best assassins wouldn't have been amiss with larry , curly and mo .  so much for plot and characters .  the music is atrocious .  it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying .  bring back queen .  there was an audible sigh ( of relief ? )  when connor played a queen track in a juke box .  i believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release .  the acting is at best flat , except for mr . connery .  lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered "" there can be only one "" this time around it just made me wish there had only been one -- highlander .  michael ironside is unconvincing ; sorry , michael , i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable .  so why 2/10 ?  visually the film is interesting at all times .  it has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning .  add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film -- or is he smirking to himself ?  his lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey -- * i'd * have done it for 12 million .  oh , and i agree with a previous reviewer , she * does * look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film .  incidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii : the wizard .

0|"200 cigarettes takes place on new year's eve 1981 .  monica , played by martha plimpton is having a huge new year's party .  everyone in town is trying to get there , but some are caught up in other things .  this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes .  as we meet the characters headed towards the party , we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal , and not interesting at all .  this disappointed me greatly .  the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion .  lucy , played by courtney love , is with kevin , played by paul rudd .  the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship , but starts to blossom into something more than that .  this subplot is extremely boring and dull , and i am getting quite sick of plots like that .  janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot , dealing with kevin .  she plays ellie , an ex-girlfriend of kevin's .  this subplot is completely a waste of garofalo's talent .  there was no point to it at all , and it was hardly even in the movie .  when lucy runs into a bartender , played by ben affleck , another subplot is formed .  the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monica's party .  at the bar , he runs into two more girls .  the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker , but unfortunately , due to the terrible acting of both of them , i don't even remember their characters names .  ben affleck is a good actor , but his character doesn't go anywhere so he doesn't have much screen time to give a good performance .  featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles , and they are part of the reason the film is so bad .  christina ricci plays val , and gaby hoffman plays stephie .  the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost .  they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night .  this subplot was alright , but it was quite annoying with stephie's accent .  hoffman did an okay job of acting , but ricci did good .  she was underused , considering she is such a wonderful actress .  another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy , played by goldie hawn's daughter , and jack , played by jay mohr .  jack is an actor who doesn't care about the girls he goes out with , he just likes dates for one night , and the next day he doesn't .  kate hudson is a huge klutz .  she gets herself into very funny situations , that are the funniest parts in the entire movie .  they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well .  this subplot could have been used more , mainly due to hudson's performance .  mohr wasn't good , but he wasn't bad .  he was just alright , which i didn't find acceptable .  there is not much to say about the performances in the film .  none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not .  the only performances that i can judge are christina ricci's as always good performance , kate hudson's funny role , courtney love's mediocre performance , and paul rudd's annoying and overused performance .  i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr , ben affleck , casey affleck , gaby hoffman , dave chapelle , and especially out of janeane garofalo .  the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes .  martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981 .  the soundtrack is full of 1980's tunes , ranging from "" i want candy "" to "" tainted love . ""  the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s .  during the film , i often found myself asking the questions , "" is there a reason to this ?  is there any moral story ?  is there a point ?  are any of the events going on in the film necessary ?  do i care what lucy and kevin are going through ?

0|"i'll be the first to admit it .  when you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch .  yes , it's a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine .  certainly , the experience wasn't truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , "" i'm not going to tell the story the way it happened . . . i'll  gonna tell it the way i remember it . ""  anyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it's trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations .  instead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult ) .  finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs . joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper ) .  the setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s .  finn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects ) .  during one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro ) .  borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro's criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor .  ok . . . maybe  that's an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini's records in the opening scenes of the film .  and that's nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn's motorboat , but i digress .  anyway , finn does the convict a good deed , just to show that he's a really swell guy .  and then the plot moves on .  enter miss havisham . . . or  ms . dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft ) .  abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms . dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid .  with bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role .  although she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film .  joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner , but the insane ms . dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece , estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl , gwyneth paltrow as an adult ) .  for no apparent reason , other than to provide the main plot of the film , finn is instantly stricken for the estella .  perhaps it's her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person , or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before .  in any case , neither as children nor adults , chemistry simply doesn't exist between the two , and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her .  even when , as an adult , finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor , reacquaints himself with estella , and draws her portrait in the nude , there's nothing .  in fact , there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear's gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets .  at this point , the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella's character , and couldn't care less about the two characters .  the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow .  she fails to imbue estella , a remote character in the book , with even the vaguest traces of humanity .  there's obviously something wrong when , watching the film , you're more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character .  without a strong estella , finn's obsession seems baseless .  you wish he would just stop whining , let estella marry his rival , walter plane ( an oddly subdued hank azaria ) , and just get on with his life .  in fact , the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot .  finn's relationship with his brother-in-law , joe , is interesting , if a bit stereotypical .  what's more fascinating are his interactions with deniro .  although it's only a bit part , it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create .  it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film .  some of the shots work , but others are too obviously staged ( for example , both of the water fountain scenes ) to have any impact .  finn's art ( actually the creations of italian painter , francesco clemente ) is used throughout the film , but it mostly fails to have the intended effect .  we never see why finn would generate this style of art , which is simultaneously crude and insightful .  as a result , it ends up as distant as the rest of the film .  modernizing the classics is currently in vogue ( just see william shakespeare's romeo+juliet ) .  simply update the action to a modern setting , and apply plenty of modern rock .  but such adornments do little to perk up great expectations .  as much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it , you'd probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film .

""  but heston has already seen a cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species , before apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president .  and he takes them there , holding up a baby doll and yelling , "" if humans couldn't speak , then how do you account for this talking doll ? !

"" ) .  he becomes a first-rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr . magoo-style onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations , which plays like something out of a sitcom .  and not a good sitcom , i mean .  the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each other's face .  and in a scene taken straight from there's something about mary , corky gives a dachshund mouth-to-mouth resuscitation .  but it's not a complete disaster .  the manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments , including a bit featuring a cat in a fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren , a german shephard , and a kilo of cocaine .  plus , berg -- whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope -- gives a great turn as the illiterate brother paulie .  and , it's nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work .  unfortunately for those out there who can't truly appreciate animal or fart jokes , corky won't have much to offer you .  so the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv , asking , "" who is corky ?

0|"kids today , they don't just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr . loving on the ladies .  no , they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department : namely , playing baseball .  through a series of drippy voiceovers , we are informed that there's no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues , where college also-rans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention .  our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham a's , where he is hoping for his big break .  it's only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a woman's thong ( don't ask ) that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be : that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne , struggling to make a name for himself ; that neither his father ( fred ward ) nor brother ( jason gedrick ) pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries ; and that the local beauty tenley -- tenley !   ( jessica biel ) -- is so far out of his league that he probably shouldn't even bother . . .  but of course he makes a play for her .  summer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots -- the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee ( brittany murphy ) , the alienation felt by ryan's non-baseball playing best friend ( gabriel mann ) , or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles ( marc blucas ) .  worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that '70s show's wilmer valderrama and beverly d'angelo , both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs . robinson-like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham .  in fact , virtually all of summer catch feels like it's been done better somewhere else .  for starters , the film has a major question of identity .  it's definitely not a sports movie , and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance .  the worst part is the amateurish script ( co-written by an arli$$ writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3 ) , chock-full of phony emotion .  by the end , it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart .  dad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice .  coach ( brian dennehy , just loving the fact that he's got some work on the big screen ) is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint .  ryan's catcher ( matthew lillard , playing himself again ) is on hand to tell ryan to "" play catch "" with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy .  ryan's stoner best friend is on hand to give the go-get-'em-tiger-we're-behind-you talk .  and the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarming-nuzzly-follow-your-dreams counsel .  before long , you start to wonder : is freddy prinze jr . is capable of having a thought of his own ?  don't answer that .  the only real joy in the film is found in biel's character , and not just because of the skimpy outfits , which are also usually wet .  she's the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role , taking the rebelling-against-daddy character to at least a passing grade .  when she's on screen , the time flies by .  when she's not , you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long .  for a pg-13 teen romance ( despite near-constant sexual innuendo ) , one has to ask warner brothers : what were you thinking ? ? ?  for her part , biel has fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards .  hollywood is either about to eat her alive . . .  or vice versa .  either way , good luck , jessica .  as for freddie , if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year , prinze's next "" summer catch "" is liable to be a venereal disease .

""  this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 ) , heathers ( 1989 ) and clueless ( 1995 ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich ? s .  along the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own .  the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels , julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel , marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her "" foxy "" , and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise .  liz is everyone's favorite because she's both beautiful and kind .  liz is about to turn 17 and , as a prank , courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning .  in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her .  they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtney's car but when they open it later , polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment , their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at liz's dead body ) .  courtney , thinking fast , decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her .  things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to .  in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into "" vylette "" , hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students .  up until about this point the film is effective enough .  however , an investigation begins into liz's death and the film becomes excessively dull .  the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch .  courtney's plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson , in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second .  meanwhile , the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot .  julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) .  he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid .  fern's rise to popularity is equally lame .  we do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section .  it's a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high school's resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate , using a popsicle , exactly what he would like for her to do to him .  it at least provides us with a look at courtney's personality but the way the scene finishes doesn't make any sense .  stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting .  william katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are liz's distraught parents , jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julie's creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman .  at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinema's greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer .  the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look .  the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid .  they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color .  director of photography amy vicent , who beautifully lensed eve's bayou ( 1997 ) , does a remarkable job here as well .  shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive .  performances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty .  none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer tatyana ali , who has a small role as a cheerleader .  the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like "" auto stud , "" "" college stud , "" and "" high school stud #2 .

0|" "" with all that education , you should know what happiness is . ""  starring sylvia chang , teresa hu , hsu ming , li lieh , mao hsueh-wei ; directed by edward yang ; written by yang and wu nien-chen ; cinematography by christopher doyle and chang hui-kung  every country has , eventually , its new wave .  france had its nouvelle vague , brazil its cinema novo , china its fifth generation , and on and on .  some waves just take longer than others , before they wash over us , cleansing us with the balm of discovery .  taiwan's new wave came in the 1980s , in the work of directors like hou hsiao-hsien , wan jen , and edward yang ; that day , on the beach--yang's first feature--is central .  it created a new language for young taiwanese directors , even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering .  later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here , giving taiwan a distinctive international presence .  that day itself is long and frustrating , the document of a nation's attempt to find a voice .  it does not lack ambition .  it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan , in the manner of antonioni , elaborating the alienation that the westernized white-collar middle-class feel as their lives are shaped by old-fashioned roles--dedicated career men , loyal housewives--that they find unfulfilling .  jia-li ( sylvia chang ) is the focus , but the film brings others into its compass--her husband , her brother , friends from her college days--as it charts her discontents .  no one is happy .  jia-li married her husband , we-lei , at a young age .  at the time , her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage , despite his affection for another woman , and so jia-li's marriage seemed , in comparison , a good one : she chose we-lei of her own free will , they loved each other .  but it goes wrong .  that day dutifully presents all the clich ? s : we-lei becomes absorbed in his career , indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; jia-li feels restless and trapped , bound by a choice she made while young , but which no longer seems wise .  the film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured .  it unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother's old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college .  both women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness .  their circumstances ( and those of jia-li's brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc . --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate .  it is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didn't .  the problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy .  for a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins .  the film's sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan .  seen now , it does not seem provocative .  indeed , it's hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull .  and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined .  nor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material .  there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couple's first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband's mistress--but they are brief .  too often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes--grocery shopping , flower-arranging--in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted .  perhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating .  but jia-li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties .  at two hours and forty-five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long-winded .  consider the defining moment for jia-li , the titular day on the beach .  the thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation .  even so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point .  needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout .  the look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative .  it was the first feature shot by christopher doyle--at least , it's his name in the credits--who is now rightly regarded as one of the world's leading cinematographers .  in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar-wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image .  you would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle's inexperience or yang's humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible .  in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak .

""  of course there are very few completely original ideas .  even earth-shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience .  there is , after all , no need to re-invent the wheel time after time .  recently it seems that hollywood doesn't feel the need to even re-write the script .  my understanding of the word "" sequel "" is a continuation of the story .  the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes .  have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalma's adaptation of the steven king novel ?  this is your dream come true .  rachel ( emily bergl ) , a high school outcast , is beginning to notice weird things happening around her .  doors slam shut by themselves .  glass globes blow up .  her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent .  a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out .  the in-crowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event .  any of this sound familiar ?  once the audience catches on that this is the same story as "" carrie "" , there's little to do but wait for the inevitable ending .  the effects are a bit better this time around , but the film doesn't work nearly as well .  there are a couple of minor plot differences .  rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized .  the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original .  they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest .  and , uh , there must be other story changes but none stand out .  one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell .  over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie .  now a high school counselor , she befriends rachel , but her character's potential is squandered .  there's too much about sue that doesn't make sense .  after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates , sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachel's mother is in .  still living in the same small town , the woman with a well-known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor ?  sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease .  this may be the one original idea in the film , but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a "" disease "" is never explained .  sue's eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldn't figure out what to do with her .  blink and you'll miss it .  some of the events are filmed in black and white , but the rationale for this is unknown .  it doesn't add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random .   "" the rage "" retains some of the trappings of "" carrie "" without the meaning .  in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carrie's onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating .  here there's an abundance of red , but for no apparent purpose .  the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin .  one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds .  the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original .  seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film - and the flaws in this one .

0|"plot outline - wendy ( samantha press ) , a jazz singer , loves mack ( hugo race ) a criminal and wanna be rock singer who's planning a bank heist .  mack is also being tailed by a couple of cops , one an inexperienced rookie ( dominic sweeney ) , the other ( john flaus ) a worn out veteran who frequents wendy's jazz club .  they're tailing mack , because he has an audiotape that may show evidence of governmental corruption .  meanwhile wendy's sexually awakener , fifteen year old sister ( rebecca elmaloglou ) has moved in with her , and is secretly watching mack and wendy's late night love trysts ? much zaniness ensues  the review : main problem first - about 2% of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work .  unfortunately , trying to cast hugo race as a violent , sexy criminal falls into the "" what the hell where they thinking "" category that takes up 98% of the rest .  but , hell , it's not as if he's the only problem in this well-intentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller .  leads , race and samantha press are wooden and dull , hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on .  though they do manage some heat later in their love scenes , helped , no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut .  the film suffers every time the story shifts back to these two .  which is unfortunately , the other main story isn't any great shakes either .  the second part , concerning two cops , political corruption and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled .  at many points during the movie i had no idea what was going on , a situation that didn't improve on repeated viewing .  there is no doubt that this film's achilles heel is its script .  as for the rest of the cast , it's a mixed bag .  john flaus , one of australia's most criminally underused actors , is in top form as the withering , alcoholic jazz fan cop , who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder .  although he falters at one point , when the script calls for him to get up on stage and deliver a drunken beat sermon , but believe me , they way it was written , no one could have pulled it off .  dominic sweeney is fine , though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens but he really isn't given a whole lot to do .  pre home and away elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo , but her character seems extraneous to the story , well , at least until the final scenes .  i must admit , in too deep does have some impressive qualities , not the least of which is it visual element .  cinematographers mark gilfedder & peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city , which is akin to turning london into san paolo .  the bar is an oppressive red , like all of it's patrons are being baked while they drink , outside it hazy orange by day and cool blue by night .  if only deborah parson's script could have supported this idea better .  having two director's ( colin south & john tatoulis ) doesn't help either , the most glaring example of which is the final retribution/fight scene , where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen action , and more importantly it doesn't pull away to anything else .  it just stays static as the fight happens in the distance .  it has no reason to it ; it's just bad direction .  and , ultimately , that is what sums up in too deep , it's tries to be good , and you want it to work , but , it's just lacking the talent behind it , that it needs to succeed .
