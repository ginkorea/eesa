1|underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today .  1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year .  we always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them .  this year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films .  critics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment .  but as i viewed 'double jeopardy' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie .  the always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend .  her husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted .  after a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck .  of course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her .  however she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money .  she pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years .  while making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby's heart stop right there .  she realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead , one of her cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again .  which means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it .  after she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones .  he is a man who has had his share of bad things .  while out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not .  whatever happens the film was excellent to me .  i found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great .  ashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie .  even if you know what is going to happen in the end , you don't know how .  this is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don't know how they are going to make it happen .  it could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way .  the movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made .  it gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances .  the characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years .  even though a lot of critics didn't like the film , i loved it .  the director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie .  i found it not to be boring at all and it's only flaw comes from some predictability .  it moved at a fast pace , has suspense , humor , heart and great acting .  it earns it's right to be a great movie and to me that's what it was .  |0.6407333333333334|0.8666666666666667|0.7666666666666666|"The sentiment of the text is overwhelmingly positive as the user expresses their love for the movie ""Double Jeopardy"", praises the acting, writing, and emotional impact, and highlights its suspense, humor, heart, and overall quality, earning it the status of a great movie."
1|as fairy tales go , cinderella has to be one of the most famous .  almost everyone knows it , well at least in north america .  so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it .  it has been done before with varying results .  this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time .  the basic story remains unchanged but , one thing that seems to vanish with this version , and that is all the fantastical elements of the story .  there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature .  after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least .   .  unlike in the fairy tale , the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end .  the ? prince' , who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france , meets 'cinderella' , known as danielle , on a few occasions , most coincidentally and he becomes smitten with her .  although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling . .  the story takes place in a renaissance setting ; in france , with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion .  this addition of leonardo da vinci , was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie , since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical .  for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired .  for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle , a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that .  especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne .  the characters of danielle ( cinderella ) played by drew barrymore , and that of the evil step mother , played by anjelica huston , are well developed and well played by the two women .  although the part of danielle is a bit stretched it is not too unlikely and not totally unbelievable .  the nuances of the character are brought out well by drew barrymore and from watching the movie it seems like she had fun making the movie .  as a contrast the part of the evil step mother is clearly seen from the very beginning and is almost clique .  but , anjelica huston seems to add a certain flair to the role that makes it suit the movie nearly perfectly .  the actual story is fairly predictable since it is after all the basic story of cinderella , but there are more than enough twists in how the story is told to make it interesting and enjoyable .  the acting is of high caliber and seems deserved of praise .  all in all this movie takes you back into history , into a seemingly magical fairy land .  but , don't get me wrong there is nothing but reality , it is just refreshing to watch a movie that is not based in a familiar setting with everyday familiar things happening .  so although the story is basically familiar the world it is set in is not , and that adds a dimension to the film which in this humble reviewers opinion makes it worth seeing  |0.39366666666666666|0.8386666666666667|0.789|The movie is praised for its realistic and believable rendition of the Cinderella story, well-developed characters, high-quality acting, and the refreshing addition of Leonardo da Vinci. Some roles are considered stereotypical and the prince's character is criticized for being unstable. Overall, the sentiment is positive due to the praise for storytelling, acting, and the refreshing setting, despite some negative aspects such as the lack of fantastical elements and a predictable storyline.
1|"it stands as a moment one will not soon forget : a giant , green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale , narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds .  this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek , dreamworks' second computer animated feature , but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema , a page of this tale serves as that ogre's toilet paper .  from this opening moment , one can infer shrek's defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard , disney-esque fairy tale .  although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek , the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship , courage , and acceptance , excelled by outstanding direction , stunning actor voice work , and most importantly , a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye .  while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults , positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline : shrek , the previously mentioned ogre , holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community .  the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider , known only as the donkey ( his species ) who talks , and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time , shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world .  the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad , learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way .  their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on , exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone .  shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey .  courage demonstrates itself within two major storylines : along the journey to rescue fiona , donkey's immeasurable cowardice reveals itself .  whether he encounters walking over a shaky bridge or living alone , donkey withholds fears that he continuously puts aside without self-acknowledgment .  but the yapping donkey must face his phobias when presented with the giant , fire-breathing dragon guarding fiona ; either he dies from terror or he triumphs with courage .  he wisely chooses courage by pretending as if no dangerous situation actually faces him , allowing the donkey to overcome a horror that likely only continued due to his insistence of them .  secondly , upon shrek's and donkey's redeeming of princess fiona , the ogre finds the princess has plans for whomever saves her : to satisfy her desire for a ( human ) knight in shining armor .  throughout this storyline , shrek faces his deep , perpetual misgivings of inhering as an ogre and struggles to determine how he will reveal his true identity to fiona .  an ongoing struggle occurs between himself and his reluctance of the truth , but eventually , shrek courageously conquers his fear by telling the forbidden secret to fiona .  children can realize from donkey and shrek that fear remains only as complicated as one makes it ; if one sets his/her mind to overcoming something in particular , endless possibilities exist .  after the friendships and courage prevail , the three central characters at the heart of shrek must take one more stretch of development : acceptance .  surprisingly , fiona holds a dark secret of her own : due to a spell cast upon her years ago , she transforms into an ogre by night .  in this storyline , fiona must learn to hold acceptance for herself , and she must realize what beauty truly means : to simply act as one's self .  upon fiona's learning of shrek's desire to pursue a relationship with her , fiona , knowing that acceptance of herself serves as the only platform for her love with shrek to work , gives in to her inner demons of self-ridicule and hatred .  any child can pull from fiona's transformation the meaning of beauty and the meaning of self-acceptance .  on the technical side , shrek triumphs .  directors adam adamson and vicky jenson pace shrek in a consistent and satisfying manner , evenly distributing the lessons learned by the central characters .  these central characters spring to life thanks to brilliant voice work from mike myers ( shrek ) , eddie murphy ( donkey ) , and cameron diaz ( princess fiona ) .  myers creates his shrek as a lovable and troubled ogre whose green color not only serves as a skin color but perhaps his envy of other , "" normal "" beings .  murphy succeeds with his donkey through recreating the high-strung persona that so many know the actor to have off screen .  cameron diaz exudes charisma and innocence as fiona , giving the princess/ogre a sense of power that many female characters in animated films lack .  while the direction and voice work certainly elevate shrek , the ultimate factor in the film succeeding lies in the screenplay , written by ted elliott , terry rossio , joe stillman , and roger s . h .  schulman .  the script never underestimates the intelligence of the viewer , combining the three previously spoken of elements with humor for adults and children alike .  capping it off with a constant tongue-in-cheek feel that pokes fun at classic disney animated features , the fresh and entertaining screenplay delivers .  with shrek , dreamworks executive jeffrey katzenberg has certainly one-upped himself by creating an instant animated classic that will live on for ages to come .  the smaller children will laugh and cheer ; the adults will laugh even harder and leave understanding much that their children did not .  a film that breaks stereotypes and creates a definite standard of its own , shrek can certainly endure as one for the ages .

1|"for a movie about disco-era excess , "" 54 "" comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club .  think of it as a sort of "" boogie nights "" -lite - where that similarly-structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings-on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift , "" 54 "" leaves the kinkier details to your imagination .  it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter , but it thankfully never resorts to preaching , either .  in fact , were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment , "" 54 "" would be about as feathery as the time period's popular female hairstyle .  studio 54 was a haven for the rich , famous and generally good-looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986 .  inside , anything went and , we are told , everything did .  the film's fictional main character is shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , the jerky jock from "" i know what you did last summer "" ) , a fresh-faced 19-year-old who dreams of venturing beyond the club's velvet rope and coming face-to-face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines .  his wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell ( mike myers ) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in '79 and permits him passage - but not before he doffs his hideous shirt , of course .  once inside , shane becomes seduced by the club's dizzying vortex of sex and drugs .  he has such a good time that he doesn't want to leave , so he seeks employment as a busboy .  he quickly becomes friends with greg ( breckin meyer ) and anita ( salma hayek ) , a married couple who work along side of him ; greg's a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender , while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own .  after rubbing elbows ( among other things ) with a renowned socialite ( sela ward ) and gaining the personal interest of rubell , shane begins to ascend to the upper echelons of 54 .  but fame doesn't come without a price .   "" 54 "" 's major shortcomings lie within its handling of the supporting players - at a slim hour-and-a-half , the film is too short to take on such a multi-character focus , and more than a few balls are dropped in the resulting juggling act .  alleged last-minute edits and reshoots are more than likely to blame for the occasionally rushed development and ambiguous interaction , since "" 54 "" sometimes feels like it's missing a scene here or there .  nowhere is this more apparent than in shane's relationship with soap opera actress julie black ( neve campbell ) , a frequent studio 54 patron whom he's long admired from afar .  the romance is prodded along before it has a chance to transform into something special .  that "" 54 "" works despite these limitations , then , is largely due to the competence and energy with which it's assembled .  sure , it's shallow , slick , sanitized portrait of a bygone age , and sure , we've seen the rags-to-riches story gazillions of times , but debut director and screenwriter mark christopher keeps things moving with lively snapshots of the studio 54 hustle and bustle and an even livelier cast to inhabit his bouncy vision .  the film boasts some fine comic creativity , the pinnacle of which is disco dottie ( "" the wedding singer "" 's ellen dow ) , an elderly dancing queen who plays the loving grandmother in public , but slides up to shane behind 54's closed doors and asks for a "" funky little treat . ""  the solid , sexy cast smooths out - if only while you're caught up in the film - any rough spots belonging to their alter-egos or the plot .  newcomer phillippe has the charisma and joisey accent down pat ; he and campbell , as fetching as ever , look so good together it's a shame their subplot goes nowhere .  meyer exhibits the congenial appeal that made him a delight to watch in "" clueless "" ( he was the stoner with the joker-smile ) , while hayek simply sizzles , especially when leading a dance class with the mantra , "" one , two , three , attitude ! ""  sherry stringfield , unidentifiable under big '70s hair , takes on her first big-screen gig since she left "" er "" as rubell's accountant , but she's criminally underused .  as the droopy-eyed , drug-addled steve rubell , myers is worth the price of admission alone .  when he's not playing the life of the party , the ex- "" saturday night live "" comedian strips away all of rubell's confidence and swagger to show a man desperately trying to fill his empty , unhappy life with exorbitance ; it's a moment worthy of pity when , while lounging on a bed of money and vomiting from a particularly heavy evening , he attempts to seduce one of his employees .  and while his performance is largely serious , myers mixes the empathy with a delicate "" austin powers "" -esque wink , thus keeping consistent with "" 54 "" 's overall feel - gaudy , larger-than-life and satisfyingly ornamental , not unlike a giant disco ball .

1|"in 1994 , an insider's look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton's 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ) .  now , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever .  but the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president .  it is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics .  jack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination .  he is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) .  the film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton's ideals and helps to organize the campaign .  he joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) .  governor stanton's past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage .  to help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby "" the dustbuster "" holden ( kathy bates ) .  the acting throughout primary colors is superb .  it would be worth seeing the movie for bates' wild performance alone .  she enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance .  travolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little .  emma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can't let anything show that might hurt the presidential run .  the problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom .  primary colors treads lightly on this issue .  though stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues .  in fact , most of the "" bad guys "" are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house .  rather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control .  although the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president's current troubles ) .  primary colors' chief problem is its length .  it runs about 15 minutes too long .  there are some scenes which could have easily been cut .  for example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists .  the scene's only apparent purpose is to establish stanton's character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film .  the extra length isn't long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film .  republicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors .  it's a funny , and at some times shocking , look at the modern political process .

1|"eyes wide shut isn't the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick's final film , but it is an impressive achievement ; a mesmerizing , haunting , adult psychodrama about marriage , fidelity and sex .  it's a stanley kubrick film from beginning to end , consistently exhibiting the auteur's trademark penchant for long , continuous takes , his unparalleled deftness behind the camera and his uncanny ability to extract gorgeous performances from his exhausted cast ( indeed , eyes wide shut attained infamy even before its release for its notoriously laborious shoot : kubrick , a renowned perfectionist , reportedly held his cast "" hostage "" on the set for nearly a year ) .  in an uncharacteristic maneuver , kubrick cast two big-name stars in the lead roles , namely real-life husband and wife tom cruise and nicole kidman .  they play bill and alice harford , a volatile couple who , during the course of a couple nights , ponder the validity of the idea that a husband and a wife must be faithful to each other .  he is an m . d . , she's unemployed and we are introduced to them as they are getting ready to go to a fancy party .  at the affair , they are both propositioned and both nearly succumb to the temptation to play around with someone else .  when they return to their lavish new york apartment kidman ( after smoking a dash of weed ) inquires whether her husband had sex with two models who approached him during the night .  he ( truthfully ) says that he did not and asks what happened with that hungarian guy she was dancing with .  they proceed to argue until alice tells her spouse a lustful story : evidently some time ago , she had a thing for a young naval officer .  she admits that she was ready to give up her whole future with bill and their young daughter if this guy wanted her even for one night .  bill is jolted by alice's story and we anticipate his reaction , but at that moment he gets a phone call and has to go "" show his face "" at the house of a just-deceased patient .  this turns out to be the beginning of a long and eventful night on the town .  the daughter of the dead patient hits on him but he wisely turns her down .  he almost does the dirty deed with a kindly hooker who approaches him on the street .  then , through a series of coincidences , he winds up at a gothic mansion where a ritualistic ( and frankly , creepy ) orgy takes place , with costumed people performing various public sex acts on each other .  erotic dread mounts as cruise ( who's not supposed to be there ) wonders the spacious halls watching the "" action "" until he is discovered to be an outsider .  much hoopla has been raised over the fact that warner bros . digitally edited the orgy scene .  with the help of a computer , they put in cloaked figures to block some of the actual sex acts ( they can still be seen , just not in all their glory ) in order to avoid the dreaded nc-17 rating .  european viewers will see the film as kubrick envisioned it .  roger ebert calls the american version the "" austin powers version , "" and many others have bashed the alterations .  i am of the potentially controversial opinion that the figures only supplement the scene's mystical atmosphere .  the first thing one notices about eyes wide shut is how it looks .  this is an artful , distinctively gorgeous production , shot in dark , moody hues and featuring some elaborate , beautiful scenery .  from the giant mansion used in the film's centerpiece to the decor at the christmas party to the harford's apartment , this film is always a pleasure to look at .  to boot , a great soundtrack makes it more atmospheric still .  at the core , behind the graphic , controversial content and unappealing mood , this is a good-natured movie that emphasizes the importance of fidelity .  it looks at sex as almost perfunctory by portraying it as unnerving rather than erotic .  it's something superficial and yet something necessary to achieve a deeper relationship .  at the end , it seems , bill's eyes are wide open to the special kind of love he and his wife have for each other , more meaningful than anything he could ever hope to find on the streets of new york .  kubrick elicits wonderful performances from both cruise and kidman .  tom is completely convincing as dr . harford , a man who seems guided solely by destiny , with no control of the course his life will take .  nicole projects a quiet intensity as the jittery yet aggressive wife and her performance is stunningly effective : she's headed for an oscar nod .  the movie has some help from a similarly strong supporting cast , at the head of which is director-cum-thespian sidney pollock , enigmatic and articulate as harford's mysterious friend .  eyes wide shut is not perfect : the last hour could have used a slightly more scissor-happy editor and both cruise and kidman are too good- looking for me to believe that either would have a very strong temptation to philander .  still , this is an important work from a great director , and while it may not be on par with some of stanley kubrick's best it is a worthy final film , a complex exploration of jealousy and faithfulness .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  "|0.6666666666666666|0.8166666666666668|0.85|The reviews all express positive sentiment towards the film, praising it for its

1|note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  milos forman's first film since the ill-fated valmont , columbia's the people vs .  larry flynt , is a vastly entertaining ( if not particularly enlightening ) biopic of hustler publisher and self-made millionaire larry flynt , who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s .  the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order : we open with young and dirt-poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy , peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky .  cut to forward in time , where the two flynt brothers , now young men , are running the struggling hustler go-go clubs in cincinnati .  the strip clubs are in a dire financial state , and in a last-ditch effort to salvage the operations , flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter .  this evolved into the adult periodical _hustler_ magazine , creating larry flynt a vast financial empire , and the rest is history .  what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material , and who railed and preached against him - flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt - and his driven , single-minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression , regardless of personal cost .  the people vs .  larry flynt also weaves in the bittersweet story of flynt's true love , althea leasure , whom he meets as a dancer in his club and later marries , and who devotedly stands alongside him throughout his trials and tribulations .  considering the serious nature of the film's theme - the importance of the united states' first amendment - the people vs .  larry flynt is surprisingly and wonderfully light-hearted and humourous .  much of the comedy is elicited from larry flynt's outlandish stunts at his courtroom appearances - some of his chosen apparel is hilarious - and for the most part these elements of the film work far better than some of the more dramatic points , such as an uninspiring flynt monologue set at a free speech rally in front of an enormous american flag dealing with the subjectivity of obscenity .  the film's focus is on the flynt's many battles over first amendment rights and freedom of speech , but the heart of the people vs .  larry flynt is the touching love story between flynt and althea .  larry flynt is shown as being occassionally gruff , harsh , and overtly aggressive with his friends and colleagues , but with althea , we see his loving , affectionate side .  there's a scene where flynt tenderly takes his ill wife on a ride on his wheelchair that is heartbreaking .  ultimately , the emotional power that the film hits at its conclusion comes not from his achievements from his battles against censors , but from the strength of flynt and althea's love for each other .  woody harrelson is entirely engaging in what must be certainly a career-topping performance as the irrepressible larry flynt .  harrelson plays flynt with the right mixture of outrageousness and confident stubborness to make him endearing and entirely sympathetic to the audience , and a very compelling protagonist for the film .  courtney love plays althea leasure in a startling turn , completely raw and impulsive .  it's a very solid performance , brash and naturalistic , and love is extremely compelling ; it's difficult to take your eyes off her onscreen , and her chemistry with harrelson is dead-on .  edward norton , as flynt's straight , level-headed lawyer is often upstaged by his flashier co-stars in the people vs .  larry flynt , much as his counterpart lawyer alan isaacman was upstaged by flynt during many of the courtroom scenes , but norton shines in his big scene where he addresses the supreme court in the climactic scene of the film .  one can sense the frustration that norton's character feels when harrelson's free-talking flynt sabotages trial after trial on him by openly speaking his mind , and this results in a heightened emotional punch when norton's isaacman has the opportunity to sway the supreme court judges .  milos forman keeps the film moving - although it runs over two hours , it never drags - and his direction of the film is very effective , eliciting a great deal of empathy for a subject which could be construed by some as extremely sordid and unsympathetic .  there's also a great visual technique which forman uses to indicate the passing of time in one shot , which is both clever and extremely entertaining .  two minor quibbles with the film - it certainly seems like the people vs .  larry flynt is in a rush to get to its main theme , with flynt battling against authorities and the system for his freedom of speech .  consequently , the first thirty minutes of the film , introducing and setting up the characters , seem unduly rushed ; perhaps it is merely due to the fact that these characters are so interesting , but i felt it would have worked better if this route was taken in a more leisurely fashion .  it also felt like there was a distinctive lack of insight into the inner workings of these characters - the film clearly shows what flynt , althea , isaacman , and rev . jerry faldwell did , and on a superficial level some of their motivations , but it never seemed like one could really understand the characters on a deeper level .  for example , why larry flynt was compelled by ruth carter stapleton ( president carter's sister ) to be born-again is a mystery to me .  then again , perhaps it was to him as well .  these two points don't detract greatly from the film .  the people vs .  larry flynt is certainly among the very best studio-released films of 1996 , and works both as a ringing political statement about the importance of freedom of speech and the depths to which larry flynt would go to advance the cause of free expression , and as a touching love story .  |0.3333333333333333|0.8166666666666668|0.7000000000000001|The sentiment of the review is generally positive, with praise for the entertaining and light-hearted nature of the film and the performances of Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love.

1|"until i saw the night of the hunter , it had been a long time since i had gasped while watching a movie .  forget the others and the deep end ( which veered toward strained dramatics ) , the night of the hunter is by far the scariest movie i've seen so far this year .  even though the movie is nearly 50 years old and there's a not drop of blood to be seen .  luckily , the night of the hunter , charles laughton's first and final directing gig , has been restored by the ucla film and television archive and is being re-released in october 2001 .  so , there's still plenty of time to spill your popcorn all over the place .  robert mitchum stars as harry powell , a reverend with a nasty habit of courting and then killing widows for their cash .  his newest target is young mother willa harper ( shelley winters ) , whose murderer husband ben ( peter graves ) has hidden $10 , 000 somewhere .  powell finds out about the stash and decides to court mrs . harper after he's released and ben is hanged .  but finding the money isn't easy for powell , who must contend with his stepchildren ( billy chapin and sally jane bruce ) , who know where the money is , but aren't telling .  the hard part about seeing a classic now is the pop culture monster has usually drawn and quartered and then flaunted all the memorable moments , thus ruining the spontaneity and adventure when we finally watch it for the first time .  how many spoofs or salutes to the shower scene in psycho have we seen in other movies ?  what about the brilliant baby stroller sequence from battleship potemkin ?   ( no , i'm not blaming brian de palma entirely for this sampling problem . )  yes , there are some visual elements that other directors seem to have borrowed from the night of the hunter .  powell's "" love "" and "" hate "" knuckle tattoos obviously influenced spike lee in do the right thing ( remember radio raheem ? ) .  and powell's black suit , with black tie and white shirt , could have shaped quentin tarantino's early visual style .  seeing the night of the hunter for the first time , i was amazed at how much it crackled with wicked wit and fright and how much intensity was intact .  you can now sign me up as president of the robert mitchum fan club .  he plays the role with a controlled malice that induces unease every time he appears .  he's like the senior class president with an evil streak .  if i ever need to stay awake , i'll just picture him crooning , "" leaning . . .  leaning . . . . ""  any actor who wants to play a character with a touch of evil should study his performance the way a rabbinical student studies the torah .  and credit must be handed out to laughton and cinematographer stanley cortez , who create a series of haunting , surreal shadowy images over the rural depression-era backdrop .  it's a testament to both men that they're able to invigorate what has become a hackneyed storyline ( kids harassed by evil guardians ) by sticking to the old maxim that we're more scared by what we don't see .  screenwriter and legendary film critic james agee does a beautiful job giving shape and substance to an array of supporting characters : the drunk birdie ( james gleason ) who's haunted by his wife , and the spoons ( evelyn varden and walt spoon ) whose marriage has become a verbal vaudeville act .  the only lapse is the movie's third act , when pearl and john run away from home and find a home with the motherly , bible-reading mrs . cooper ( lillian gish ) .  her showdown with powell is memorable -- a battle done with dueling hymns .  however , the whole segment feels a little rushed and underdone , but it's still a thrill seeing the queen of the silent film era handling a shotgun .  do yourself favor and don't miss this if it comes to a nearby theater .  note : a series of revealing , but overlong , outtakes preceded the movie .  the highlights included the legendary laughton ( who sounds eerily like mr . pitt from seinfeld ) running winters' lines with mitchum , and the adorable , tiny bruce having trouble descending a coal pile .  hours more of such footage exists , as laughton liked to keep the cameras constantly rolling .  screened as part of the 2001 new york film festival retrospectives ( feature story coming soon ) .

1|"jamaica is a hot vacation spot .  the exchange rate encourages delusions of wealth ( approximately 30 jamaican dollars to one american ) , the sea is a brilliant blue , the air is warm but lacks humidity .  and as tourism is unfortunately jamaica's biggest trade , foreigners enter and leave with a sense of relaxation .  life and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country .  while normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music , this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface .  the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid .  it guides the audience along a tourist's journey and the story of the native inhabitants .  instead of telling you what you are already seeing on screen , it quips , "" you don't see what happens after you flush the toilet . ""  this engages a viewer to see and think about devastation instead of merely being told it is there .  this strong , sparse storytelling approach runs throughout the film .  stephanie black is also intelligent in how she chooses to disclose the problems faced by the locals .  this isn't just another talking head show of people moaning about their horrible lot in life .  people are interviewed from all sectors of occupation , from field to factory , as well as social theorists and the banking organizations that continue to invest in the country .  the variety of discussion perpetuates a compelling internal dialogue with any viewer , whether they are seeing jamaica for the first time or not .  of course , as can be expected , the united states is slammed , owing to its involvement with the international monetary fund and the world bank .  officials look moronic as they explain why their plans for jamaica's economy will help the country back on its feet , but only if they are willing to follow the advice word for word .  the next moment we see why and how each of these initiatives has failed , usually due to imports being cheaper than local labor or whether or not the soil is appropriate for the next agricultural trend the u . s . is forcing on the citizens .  admittedly , some of the back and forth between the business-minded organizations and the failures they produce gets repetitive , but it also drives home the impact ignorance can have on both sides of an international argument .  but jamaica isn't against the united states , and this documentary does not accuse the u . s . of being the sole perpetrator of its grief .  if anything , it begs for a better understanding of the nature of jamaican society before stepping in to change it based on foreign regulations .

1|"denzel washington is among the many actors this holiday season to give very impressive milestone performances .  this perhaps may be washington's very best to date .  he joins matt damon and jim carrey in having the talent , this season , to become his character , copying mannerisms and personal styles perfectly .  his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting "" the hurricane "" a much better film than it actually is .  when his rubin "" hurricane "" carter feels pain and is tormented by racism , he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy , disgust , and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices .  the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago .  the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone , as his tortured carter , sum up the troubles of racism in america's history .  he is that amazing .  the problem with "" the hurricane "" is that when compared to washington , all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles .  mainly because the script focuses so much on carter , that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors .  this is , without a doubt , washington's movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying , it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars .  denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance .  as rubin carter , we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system .  >from the age of eleven to twenty one he was sent to a juvenile prison for a crime he did not commit .  then after a successful marriage and boxing career , he was harshly imprisoned again for life after being framed for a triple murder .  carter's second term in prison seemed almost inevitable when faced off against jealous , powerful white men who refused to let him succeed .  from these past experiences in jail , carter realized that he must make his case heard for all of america .  after several court appeals , an autobiography , and many public marches for his freedom , carter remained locked in prison .  it was not until a young black boy from brooklyn being educated in toronto read carter's book in the 1980's , that a serious battle for freedom took place .  the young boy and his three canadian guardians decide to dedicate all of their time to the case until carter is released .  the greatest scenes in the film are when carter begins to lose his mind after spending three months in isolation .  washington really shows the breakdown of carter when after swearing he would never go to jail again , he is unfairly framed at the height of his innocent career .  the devastation in washington's eyes show a man who has struggled to do the right thing his whole life only to be punished for it .  in the hole , carter attempts to maintain emotional balance but he cannot .  his anger is heightened to a point of no control .  we see multiple carters , a violent angry one , a silent passive one , and a mediator .  we see an emotional boxing match inside carter's head .  from this point in the hole to the end of the film , this fight continues .  it is very apparent at times which side is winning the battle and in some scenes there is a direct switch from angry to caring or the opposite .  when carter sees that white canadians want to help him get out of prison , the angry carter at first erupts .  white people have been trying to hurt him his whole life , this reminder leads to anger in his head .  however , as the film continues and the canadians continue to help carter we see the calm side him .  he realizes that society is changing .  that racism is decreasing and now carter wants to leave jail immediately and become a part of this world .  very rarely have i seen such determination to perfect his role as washington has done here .  if only the other actors had this same determination .  dan hedaya , ridiculously plays the man who sends carter to prison twice by forcing witnesses to lie and switching evidence around .  it felt like his character was taken straight out of a "" scooby doo "" episode ; he would have gotten away with it if it wasn't for those annoying little kids .   "" the kids "" in this film are the three canadians who are terribly underused making their relationship with carter underdeveloped and unbelievable .  the lawyers who help release carter also are underused , as is clancy brown as a kind prison guard ( the complete opposite of his character in "" shawshank redemption "" ) .  there is a great amount of talent in this supporting cast but it just never appears .  hedaya was superb in "" clueless , "" same for david paymer in "" get shorty , "" harris yulin in "" ghostbusters "" and liev schreiber in "" the daytrippers .

1|"[note : after claiming otherwise , my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh's hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap .  as it happens , it didn't take long . ]  is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli ?  known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968's romeo and juliet ( required viewing for many high schoolers , and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare ) , he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera , where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria .  last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre , one of the twin peaks ( with wuthering heights ) of romantic literature .  it might seem peculiar , then , that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen .  at first blush , hamlet is far removed from romance .  the hero , though a prince , is depressed , conflicted and confused .  the ostensible love interest gets little screen time , and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery .  the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus .  it is zeffirelli's genius , however , that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace .  in this italian master's hands , romance is everywhere -- in a son's worship of his father , in the bonds of deepest friendship , in the private thoughts of young lovers , even in the mystery of castles by the sea .  after all , the story hinges on a ghost , and what could be more romantic than that ?  what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all , namely , hiring then-reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead .  who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a "" lethal weapon "" ( in the series of the same name ) would have the skill to succeed in the most famous role in the english language ?  franco zeffirelli , that's who .  and it is apparent in every frame that his instinct was right on the money .  what gibson brings to the role is a naturalness and ease which makes the whole story meaningful , not to mention comprehensible .  his line readings sound spontaneous rather than rehearsed .  his movements and gestures ( excepting his sometimes too active eyes ) are totally in keeping with the character .  this is a hamlet whose pain we feel , whose struggle we empathize with , and whose death we mourn as sincerely as horatio at film's end .  glenn close , the other big name in the production , also does well by the script and satisfies as hamlet's mother , gertrude -- though i must confess i'm still trying to understand the character as written .   ( zeffirelli's incestuous interpretation of hamlet's relationship with his mother doesn't help . )  alan bates makes a believably evil claudius without resorting to the mannerisms of a hollywood heavy .  by and large the rest of the cast performs admirably and comfortably .  of special note are the cinematography by david watkin and the score by ennio morricone .  both support the realistic mood marvelously ( as do the sets and costumes ) , without any overstated effects that declare "" this is important ; this is shakespeare ! ""  i particularly appreciate that the words are often spoken without any music at all : the melody of a wonderfully wrought phrase is given its due .  perhaps it is difficult to call edited shakespeare "" definitive . ""  and there are certainly quite a few other filmed versions of hamlet that i have not seen .  but if you've ever felt the urge to overcome your fear of the bard , this hamlet is an excellent place to start .

1|"whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms .  he made the west dirty in "" mccabe and mrs . miller "" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in "" the long goodbye "" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with "" popeye "" ( 1980 ) .  the same holds true for his most recent film , "" the gingerbread man , "" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie .  by the time "" the gingerbread man "" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham .  there's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn't feature a great showdown in a courtroom .  instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , "" the gingerbread man "" is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman's trademark full-frontal female nudity .  the central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham's other lawyer heroes .  he is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds .  rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) .  a reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn't hard to surmise that rick's womanizing had a large part in it .  whenever he's late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it's because he's been "" screwing around . ""  after an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn't lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses .  he drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together .  rick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers .  it was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does "" weird "" stuff like that .  as another character puts it , dixon is "" a few beers short of six-pack . ""  rick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency .  he succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory's begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) .  dixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out .  from there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action .  altman's cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look .  if it isn't night-time , at least it's raining .  gu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light .  a great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability .  in the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world .  altman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies .  but , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings .   "" the gingerbread man "" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here .  however , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller .  a great deal of the credit for the film's success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction .  here , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic .  rick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character .  without it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick's pain and frustration .  the supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart-breaking role as the jewish maid in "" schindler's list "" ( 1993 ) .  tom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird .  it doesn't seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film's one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing .  while "" the gingerbread man "" isn't in league with altman's greatest works like "" nashville "" ( 1975 ) or "" the player "" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career .  some critics love to stamp films like this as "" commercial , "" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don't make money .  altman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more .

1|" "" say , any of you know how to madison ? ""  --- brad "" asshole "" majors ( barry bostwick ) shows just how unhip he is after watching the kooky transylvanians wrap up their ode to the time warp in the cult classic the rocky horror picture show .  the story behind the rocky horror picture show is one of legend .  in the early 70's , stage actor turned first-time playwright richard o'brien decided he wanted to make a musical homage to the crazy b-movies he had grown up with as a child , set to a bunch of catchy rock tunes of his own design .  the result was the stage play the rocky horror show , which opened to fairly decent reviews in london in 1973 and was even hailed the best musical of 1973 by prominent drama critics in england .  the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later , in october of 1974 .  the film version ( now titled the rocky horror picture show ) was released in 1975 . . .  and immediately tanked at the box office .  whether it was because fox wasn't quite sure how to market it to audiences or that audiences didn't quite know what to make of it themselves has never really been determined , but the one common bit of knowledge about the film was that it was a huge flop .  it seemed that the infectious spirit brought about by the stage version had not been infused into the film version and fox quickly had it pulled from theaters .  a year later , something entirely strange and magical happened .  prints of the film started to be distributed to theaters in small amounts and were circulating at midnight shows across the country , and it was then that a whole new audience found the film .  this new audience was prone to dressing up like the characters from the film , acting out segments in front of the screen as the movie played , yelling rude comments at the screen , and just generally having a good time .  word quickly spread about this new phenomena of interactive film and the rocky horror picture show's life as the ultimate cult film was born .  for the virgins out there who are unaware , the plot centers around a loving couple , brad majors ( barry bostwick ) and janet weiss ( susan sarandon ) , who come from a small town called denton .  brad and janet have just attended the wedding of two of their friends and decide that they also want to be wed .  they plan a trip to see the man who led to their meeting , dr . everett scott ( jonathan adams , who played the narrator in the original stage version ) , but their car gets a flat on the way to his home .  remembering a castle they had seen back a few miles down the road , they decide to walk there and see if the residents have a phone they might be able to use to call for assistance .  the castle is actually the home of a race of aliens from the planet transsexual ( in the galaxy of transylvania ) , who are lead by the eccentric fishnet-stocking wearing mad scientist dr . frank-n-furter ( tim curry ) .  frank-n-furter has masterminded the secret to creating life and has done so in the form of rocky ( peter hinwood ) .  as rocky becomes accustomed to his new environment , brad and janet find themselves at the mercy of frank-n-furter's mad schemes .  little do any of them know that the doctor's handyman , riff-raff ( original author richard o'brien ) , and domestic , magenta ( patricia quinn ) , are actually transsexual planetary protectors who have been sent to stop frank from spreading his alien evil all over the earth .  going back and revisiting this film after ten years ( 1990 being the first time i had ever seen it ) , it is amazing to me that this film ever got made or has had the staying power that it has .  if i had been a fox executive around the time of its release , i don't think i would have known what to make of it either .  for all intents and purposes it is a bad movie ( though bad in a really good sort of way ) , but sumptuous production design and a great deal of incredibly catchy songs really help to increase the likability of the film .  by the time the credits role , it is fairly easy to have gotten wrapped up in the film and its characters , and one really gets the feeling that richard o'brien definitely was a fan of the old cheesy b-movies his film is based on .  when i say that the wall-to-wall songs are catchy what i really mean to say is that , once you hear them , they will be ingrained in your head for all of eternity .  it goes without saying that the "" time warp "" is the most popular song in the film .  even people who have never seen the movie know of that particular song .  what those who haven't seen the movie don't know though , is that there are even more songs in the film that are just as worthy of acknowledgment .  my personal favorite is "" over at the frankenstein place "" , but "" dammit janet "" is also maddeningly catchy .  tim curry's vocals on the rocking tune "" sweet transvestite "" need to be heard to be believed .  the finale of the film , a big floor show staged by frank-n-furter and featuring most of the cast in garters and fishnets ( including barry bostwick . . .  frightening ! ) , features no less than four songs ( "" rose tint my world "" , "" don't dream it "" , "" wild and untamed thing "" , and "" i'm going home "" ) , all of which are immensely singable .  the film's true popularity and longevity resides in its audience participation though .  despite the catchiness of the songs , this movie would have been long forgotten about if it hadn't have been for the multitude of folks who dress up every friday or saturday night to rush out and be a part of their own little floor show .  watching this film at home is nothing compared to actually experiencing this in a theater with hundreds of rabid fans ( unless you don't mind inviting friends over and letting them shoot water guns in your home or letting them throw rice and pieces of toast all over the place ) .  note : director jim sharman brought back to the central characters of the film , in the form of a sequel , resulting in the very much forgotten film shock treatment , which picks up with brad and janet ( this time played by cliff de young and jessica harper ! ) as contestants on a game show in their home town of denton .  the two are menaced by the evil tv station manager ( also played by de young ) , who wishes to claim janet as his own .  o'brien returned as a writer/performer on the project ( as did quinn , campbell , and gray in performance capacity only ) , but the film had nowhere near the spirit of the original .  25 years later , this film is still the pinnacle of cult filmdom and is continuously screened at midnight all over the world .  as a lasting testament to the longevity of the film and its legion of fans , a brand new special edition 2-disc dvd set has been released that is the most comprehensive compendium of rocky horror to date ( even out shining the laserdisc special edition that was released for its 20th anniversary ) .  if you are one of those people who can't get enough of the film , this disc should be more than enough to satisfy your appetites .  in an attempt to recreate the interactivity of the film , fox home entertainment has released this wonderful 2-disc dvd set loaded with so many extras that it'll take a good eight hours just to take in the majority of it all .  the film itself is located on the first disc and has been given a beautiful transfer that shows it in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) .  the film is presented in two different versions , the us theatrical version and the uk version which adds a musical number during the finale called "" superheroes "" .  for ambitious viewers , the disc also includes a hidden version ( located on the main menu by clicking left from the scene selection menu choice and highlighting a pair of lips in the lower left corner ) which presents the film in the manner it was originally supposed to have been seen .  originally , the film was to have been similar to the wizard of oz , with the first half of the it seen in black and white ( and not changing to color until the transylvanians are first revealed to brad and janet during the time warp musical number ) .  most reports , including a documentary on the disc , say that the color was supposed to appear when frank-n-furter first shows up in the elevator , but it does seem to work better where it was placed on this version , depicting the vast difference between the world brad and janet were used to compared with the one to which they are introduced .  the film contains a commentary track by show creator ( and faithful handyman ) richard o'brien and co-star patricia quinn which is fairly enjoyable ( and quinn immediately starts off by refusing to speak about sarandon nearly contracting pneumonia while having to walk around wet and half-naked on freezing cold sets , which she apparently complained about the entire film and in future interviews ) .  the two seem like old friends and have great stories to tell , but they also point out cast members that are sadly no longer with us anymore ( and there are quite a few ) .  fox has also tried to recreate the feel of attending the film in a theater with several audience participation segments .  the first feature ( and the most simple ) is a subtitle prompter which lets you know when to open up on people with your water guns or when the right time to throw your toast is .  the second feature is an audience participation track , which lets you in on what you might hear on a good night out at the show .  most of the comments are unintelligible because it is basically just a large group of people screaming their heads off , but every once and a while a comment can be heard that will invoke a bit of laughter .  the final participation segment uses a technology very much like the technology used on the matrix dvd , where a pair of lips will appear on-screen during certain scenes of the film ( mostly during the musical numbers ) that can be selected by pressing enter on your remote .  when selected , you will be taken out of the film and into a live participation version of the scene put on during one of the many screenings that occur all over the world .  once the segment is over , you are deposited right back into the film where you left off .  the first disc also contains a few dvd-rom goodies for those with that particular type of dvd player .  there is a timeline of the evolution from the stage play version to worldwide cult sensation , a video jukebox , a you don't know jack-styled trivia game ( which is about as bare bones a you don't know jack parody as it can be ) , and a bizarre mad-libs styled word game known as riff-raff's story lab .  links to the rocky horror websites are also available from the dvd-rom portion of the disc .  the second disc features even more goodies for the person who loves extras .  former lite-rock video channel turned music historians vh-1 have allowed some of their outtake footage from the "" behind the music : rocky horror "" special that they ran earlier in the year to be shown here , as well as a pop-up video for the meat loaf-sung "" hot patootie "" .  the "" behind the music "" segments are all very interesting , especially richard o'brien's jaunt through the castle ( which is now a hotel ! ) where the film was originally shot .  there are also extensions of the sarandon , bostwick , quinn , o'brien , and meat loaf interviews .  as far as extras for the film itself go , there are two deleted musical numbers that are also included here .  one of which is just the "" superheroes "" number available in the uk version , but there is also another rare musical number presented here called "" once in a while "" .  a series of alternate takes are also presented here , but none of them are really much of a revelation ( except for the undressing scene in which we see that patricia quinn is having a hard time unbuttoning barry bostwick's pants ) .  for the completist who must have every little bit of rocky horror paraphernalia , a misprinted end sequence and alternate credit sequence are also presented here .  rounding out the disc is a decent documentary called rocky horror double feature video show , two theatrical trailers ( proclaiming that the film is "" a different sort of jaws "" ) , a still gallery , and two sing-a-longs ( for "" toucha toucha touch me "" and "" sweet transvestite "" ) .  fox's special edition is the dvd set that rocky horror fans have been waiting for all their lives ( "" you're lucky . . .  i'm lucky . . .  he's lucky . . .  we're all lucky ! "" ) .  it's not just amazing enough that tons of classic italian films are finally getting their recognition in the u . s . , but even long standing traditions are finally receiving their due on the wonderful dvd format .  as with their excellent dvds of the abyss , fight club , independence day , and the sound of music , fox shows that they have most certainly made the commitment to provide the things that dvd lovers want .  i raise a toast to them ( cue the throwing of the bread ) as i cut out the lights , sit back , and watch those disembodied lips begin to sing about b-movie tradition .

1|"in "" magic town "" , jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a pollster who heads to a "" perfect "" town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only poll-takers care about .  however , as time progresses , and he finds himself falling in love with the town ( and a woman ) , he begins to see that what he's doing is wrong .  the plot is standard stuff , but that's not important .  in a film like this , it's the calibre of the actors that make or break it .  obviously , since stewart stars , that's practically a non-issue .  he's great in the film , as usual .  there's just something about him that always manages to be endearing , even when he's deceiving the town folk .  you're always on his side , and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition .  the film was directed by a longtime frank capra script-writer , and it shows .  this is the type of feel-good picture that capra is famous for .  by the time "" the end "" shows up on screen , everything has been wrapped up very nicely .  there are no loose ends , and virtually every character gets a happy ending ( those that deserve one , anyway ) .  in this age of cynicism , it's refreshing to see a movie so upbeat .

1|kevin smith is like a big kid .  his humor is that of a sophisticated juvenile's .  he grew up idolizing star wars and loves comic books , having also written a few .  he also has a cult following , mostly composed of teenagers , college students , and smith's own fellow adolescent-minded grownups .  smith is hilarious in person and in writing , but when he tries to be earnest and moralize , that is when he goes wrong .  kevin smith is a better writer than director , and he'll be the first to tell you that .  that might also be part of the reason why his moralizing comes across as so heavy-handed .  great directors show us their theses instead of having the characters sermonize them .  this was true in the overrated chasing amy , and it is true for dogma as well .  that is not to say smith's message is a bad one .  in dogma , smith tells us that problems arise when people believe beyond any doubt that their insight into god and god's desires is superior to anyone else's .  basically , dogmatism is bad .  changing the minds of the dogmatic is virtually impossible , and since the dogmatic believe that they have special insight , they also know what is best for you , whether you like it or not .  this is not exactly a new message in movies ( see inherit the wind ) , but i have no problems with recycling old ones , particularly since dogma's protesters are proving smith's point .  smith's own problem with delivering this message is that he beats us over the head with it like we are reading a dogma for dummies book .  but this is smith's personality , and his simplistic views neglect such adult issues as how does one interpret the bible ( or koran , etc . ) correctly ( or if there even is a correctly ) and how one settles disputes of heretofore dogmatic concerns .  the story concerns abortion clinic worker bethany ( linda fiorentino ) being chosen by voice of god , metatron ( alan rickman ) , to prevent the destruction of the universe by two fallen angels , bartleby ( ben affleck ) and angel of death , loki ( matt damon ) .  along the way , forgotten thirteenth apostle , rufus ( chris rock ) , stripper muse serendipity ( salma hayek ) , and slacker duo jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith himself ) come to bethany's aid .  fallen muse , azrael ( jason lee ) , proves to be the behind-the-scenes manipulator for all the chicanery .  the logical but convoluted plot only exists as an excuse for the jokes and to make smith's points , and in itself , has little dramatic momentum .  among the supposedly outrageous claims made by the film is that god is a woman , jesus was black , and the bible was written by a bunch of racist , misogynistic white men .  of course , kevin smith does not necessarily subscribe to these ideas himself .  they are a metaphor for the fears and insecurities of the dogmatic .  smith says as much in his amusing disclaimer that precedes the movie .  when harvey weinstein asked smith to put it into the film before cannes , smith thought it might give validation to protesters' claims that the film was sacrilegious , but then he rethought it and turned the disclaimer into a joke .  the film's humor is uneven .  some parts are very funny as when bethany goes for a fire extinguisher when metatron makes a burning-bush kind of entrance .  but many of the film's jokes just bomb , as in virtually anything involving salma hayek's serendipity .  also , some of the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away .  still , smith keeps the zingers coming at a sufficiently rapid pace .  among the actors , fiorentino and rickman stand out by far .  fiorentino virtually by herself gives the film emotional weight .  damon and affleck are fairly lackluster .  rock and hayek exist in the film pretty much only as comic relief as are mews and smith .  but the latter duo fare much better because jay and silent bob , who recur in all of smith's movies , are much more in line with smith's brand of humor .  bud cort , george carlin , janeane garofalo , guinevere turner , and alanis morissette all make cameo appearances .  |0.1566666666666667|0.8333333333333334|0.7999999999999999|The sentiment of the text towards Kevin Smith and his work is mixed, leaning slightly towards a balanced or neutral sentiment with both positive aspects such as his humor and cult following, as well as negative aspects such as heavy-handed moralizing and directing flaws.
