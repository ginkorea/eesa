0|capsule : one of the ten worst movies ever made .  christopher lambert vs . evil ninjas in modern-day japan . . .  and nobody wins .  the hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain-damaged that i could almost feel affection for it .  i could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren't also insanely xenophobic and insulting .  christopher lambert plays a computer-parts salesman who's on business in japan .  he meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) .  apparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered .  since lambert is a witness , he's of course the next one to die .  let's stop and think about this for a second .  if lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he'd have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock .  in this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him .  i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body .  you know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is .  this is , of course , only the beginning of the movie's problems .  lambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun .  they are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows .  the script doesn't know what the hell to do with them .  lone , as the bad guy , is zero-dimensional .  the only bad-guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him .  in the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype .  what's funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there's a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful .  also , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it's been designed to accompany .  there is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re-couple the whole thing with the movie's relentlessly stupid plot .  by the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham-handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care .  we're not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies !  someone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way .  this movie bungles two out of three , badly .  |-0.8333333333333334|0.9166666666666666|0.8666666666666667|"The movie ""The Hunted"" is overwhelmingly disliked and criticized for being one of the worst ever made, with a clumsy plot, unsalvageable hateful characters, and a soundtrack that, despite its quality, stands out.

0|"starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz  permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this .  the film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity .   ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . )  ultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself .  ben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit .  he eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for "" alf "" : chompers looks just like alf except he's blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons .  insert proverbial downward spiral here .  permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story .  i've spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i've been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive .  as stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there's something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer .  what separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy .  watch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby !  watch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble !  stiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie .  but permanent midnight is mostly soulless .  when the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ?  and then answers it in the form of bello's character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ?  in the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn't need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself .  if you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it's that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man .   ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs .  is this hollywood . . . california ? )  i learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead .  of course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems .  so , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he's apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects .  so much for the moral of that story .  temporary midnight is more like it .  -bill chambers ; september , 1998  "|-0.7666666666666666|0.9|0.85|The overall sentiment of the explanations is negative, as the reviewers express disappointment with the movie's lack of depth, uninteresting main character, and soulless portrayal.

0|"as with any gen-x mtv movie ( like last year's dead man on campus ) , the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points : sex and football .  those two items , wrapped in a guilty-pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons .  first , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre isn't mainstream and it's been retread to death .  second , the sex is just bad .  despite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all-night strip-club party , there's nothing even remotely tantalizing .  the acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic jon voight .  cultivating his usual sliminess , voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer .  kilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes' twenty-two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans to make it twenty-three .  unfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he's got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) .  moxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football-crazy west canaan .  most regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most .  similarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer .  these elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv's core audience is the high school demographic .  this focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv's "" dawson's creek , "" is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role .  other stars are similarly young and unmemorable .  there's not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there's not much to like about it , either .  everything herein has already been done , and if it hasn't , the movie manages to botch it one way or another .  this is certainly missable .

0|nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air .  the opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl .  the prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met .  if the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should .  cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained .  and thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough .  cage should have known what he was getting himself into .  he got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production .  the critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance .  in the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time .  that sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness .  while the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact .  audiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production .  in fact , the marketing people are counting on it .  no one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded .  director simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) .  what he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense .  a bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely .  if either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up .  at a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool .  their tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) .  in fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts .  it is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance .  while malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep .  his recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies .  it doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over .  there's a word for people like you , nicolas .  that word is called recidivist . . . repeat  offender .  |-0.29466666666666663|0.8000000000000002|0.8000000000000002|"The explanations provide a mixed sentiment towards the film ""Con Air"" and its lead actor Nicolas Cage.

( oh , how witty . )  she rejoins the world as a dog lover and is assigned to a probation officer , who oddly turns out to be her victim from the original film .  cruella then becomes ella -- dog lover -- until the plot twists , like a dog with his leash caught on the back of a moving truck , and she becomes the evil vixen again .  a kidnapping plot unfurls again as cruella decides she still needs her dalmatian coat , but she now needs 102 dalmatians instead of the commonly used 101 dalmatian formula .  at this point , i was envying those kids filing out of the theater .  how low have glenn close and gerard depardieu ( as the film's villain ) sunk in the film business ?  it's almost laughable in a sadistic way to watch close walk around in costumes that seem to be pulled from the wardrobe of flash gordon .  and depardieu . . .  how can a french guy have a bad french accent ?  and never mind the toilet brush haircut .  the only minutely positive selling point i can even think to point out is the talking bird with a british accent ( courtesy of eric idle ) that thinks he's a rottweiler .  now that's funny .

0|" "" the animal "" is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling .  it's clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill .  there are certainly better things you can do with your time .  actually , if you've seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments .  the story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer .  but he's afflicted with loser-itis .  dogs attack him , neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co-workers ignore him .  truthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we'd probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun .  this is actually bad because you can't like a character if you can't develop sympathy for him .  we never do , and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor .  however , marvin is found by an eccentric doctor ( michael caton ) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him , implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs .  as a result , marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed .  he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body , swim with the speed of a dolphin , and can run as fast as a cheetah .  imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation .  with his enhanced abilities , he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him .  however , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn , and instead , marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic , sexual urges .  goats beware !  he also chases cats , urinates to mark his territory , or growls at his enemies .  what he should've done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich .  equally tenuous is its other running joke , which involves one of his friends ( guy torry ) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he's black .   "" it's reverse racism , "" he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything .  this element doesn't work the first time it's mentioned , and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence .  you don't have to be as wise as an owl to realize that "" the animal "" is tame .  if there's any reason to see this film , it's to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut .  remember her ?  she was voted off in week 11 of the 13-week program , "" survivor .

0|"romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant .  with director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination .  those mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay .  call me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don't seem to mix well .  gary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife .  his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character .  jack has become addicted to "" feeding the hole "" , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money .  when he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out .  gary oldman's performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored .  in the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider .  demarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world .  this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2 . i can't remember seeing a character quite like her .  after being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety .  what a woman !  lena olin's performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film .  anabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo's wife .  there is little insight into her character .  she's depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house .  juliette lewis , as romeo's girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms . lewis' portrayal certainly didn't improve it .  both women were anything but sexy or attractive .  poorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems .  it is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something .  for example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene .  fine .  jack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite .  fine .  what does jack proceed to do ?  he brushes his friends off by telling them he isn't feeling well , then strolls over to the boss .  why ?  the boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack's toes by the gravesite .  i guess they weren't worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral . . . .  or here's another : demarkov set-up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw .  she proceeded to set the place on fire .  wouldn't the flames burn off the fingerprints ?  aren't dental records more important ?  as bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , couldn't she come up with a better plot ?   ( and it took her no time at all to get a good-fitting , functional prosthesis . )  lack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film .  this film doesn't even add up the large details .  there is little or no consistency in the story-line .  not much makes sense .  the direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable .  the moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one .  so while it certainly isn't reservoir dogs , it certainly isn't diva .  there's plenty more to tear apart in this film .  my advice to someone who hasn't seen it to to wait until it comes on video .  there are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously .  it's not a boring film , just not a good one .  or an intelligent one .

0|"54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring .  a greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors .  i , however , would rather cut to the chase .  54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring .  there is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight .  there is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots .  and it's underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they're in this year's boogie nights .  they are so wrong .  the picture has been assembled by mark christopher .  based on this film , i don't know how he got a job in the business .  54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s .  i don't know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson's brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography .  what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes .  54 can't even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining .  it's remarkably bad timing , i'd say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind .  i have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance .  that character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves .  steve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself .  alas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell's homosexual impulses .  it's here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell ) .  shane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life .   ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen . )  but he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs .  why his "" friends "" push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are "" friends "" is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he's been elevated to bartender status ) .  there isn't a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works .  most of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane .  there's a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they're arm-in-arm without a bit of development .  then , they're kissing in a bowling alley !  this is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn't a long film to begin with ) .  campbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth .  this one doesn't .  and phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg's star-making role in boogie nights .  he seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone .  i guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me .  he's all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn't help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters .  by the end of 54 , shane's most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent .  the rest of the performances are wasted .  hayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here .  meyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard .  only myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher's wading-pool of a script .  rubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance .  in fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him .  i've read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail .  frankly , i don't care .  it's easy to recreate something technical like this .  a fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task .  besides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway .  aside from myers' performance , 54 is a complete failure .  it's dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring .  some may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they're so obvious to me .  in any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast .  it doesn't even work as mindless entertainment : it's so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it .  so , don't forget those key words : dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring .  everything else i said was just padding .

0|an experience like baby geniuses can have certain effects on an average moviegoer .  you may be scarred for life after seeing this petrified piece of garbage , which is so disarmingly horrible that it may cause you to ponder it's hollywood existence .  when i think of the screenwriters behind this film , i picture a room full of monkeys .  the monkeys are pounding on their typewriters while scratching themselves .  all of the monkeys combine their efforts , hop in a cab and take the finished product downtown to director bob clark's office .  the designated monkey explains the plot by jumping up and down on clark's desk while flailing his arms and shrieking .  the director appears to be deep in thought , until he slams his fist down on the desktop and exclaims `i love it ! ! ! '  the writing behind this project is embarrassing .  for your amusement , i will explain the plot .  dr . kinder ( kathleen turner ) and dr . heep ( christopher lloyd ) are two of the cold-hearted executives at the baby geniuses institute , where peculiar studies are going on .  as the story goes , there is an ancient myth explaining that babies ( ages 2 and under ) know all the secrets of the world from previous life experiences .  when they move past this phase , they become like any other drooling toddler .  kinder and heep want to unlock the secrets using their test babies , namely little sylvester ( sly for short ) , who can break in or out of any given situation so efficiently that he would be right at home on the mission : impossible team .  there is so much crap derived from this premise , despite the fact it's virtually identical to the plot in look who's talking !   ( a far superior film in any league ) .  you will be able to determine the quality of the film by examining the opening scene .  sylvester has broken out and managed to elude several security guards with his amazing intellect and kung-fu tactics .  question : it's obvious the babies are super-smart , but why are they able to fight like jackie chan ? ?  the adults in this film are furiously beaten by these youngsters in diapers .  it's a shock when writers will stoop this low just to draw cheap laughs by using john hughes' familiar home alone formula .  i also found it disturbing that the babies in this film have attitude and endless 90's knowledge , quoting numerous movies and insulting their adult captors .  the effects in baby geniuses ( similar to the talking animals in babe ) are pathetic , the editing is a disaster , and the jokes are never funny .  the only reason viewers may avoid vomiting is the argument that the babies are `cute' .  i suppose they are .  i can admit to smiling a few times because the babies were cute .  other instances , though , i was howling in laughter due to the inane stupidity of the script .  there are supporting characters who have no personality whatsoever ; their entire existence is based on punch lines .  peter macnicol and kim cattrall , as an unwilling couple who have adopted sylvester's twin , are both miscast .  then again , i don't suppose any performer could handle the uneven material without looking incredibly stupid .  meanwhile , dom deluise plays a fellow who gets hit in the crotch with a monkey wrench ( hahaha ) .  i would avoid baby geniuses at all costs .  instead of watching this , i would recommended filling your bathtub with cement and going snorkeling .  or perhaps you would consider going diving in shark-infested waters .  anything to avoid this painful movie .  the final line in the film , spoken by the bratty sylvester , is `if they think i'm doing the sequel for less than $20 mill , they're nuts' .  sequel ?  please have mercy .  |-0.9266666666666667|0.9|0.8166666666666668|Overall, the sentiment analysis indicates that the explanations are all strongly negative, with numerous derogatory descriptions and criticisms of the movie's quality, including the plot, writing, effects, and jokes.

""  what would happen to our economy if we didn't feel the need to have more things ?  to make us buy more , businesses need to produce a ton of product .  the sheer volume of items necessitates that most of them are of dubious quality .  the film industry is like any other .  in order for studios to survive , they have to make money .  the prevailing attitude is that more films equal more profit .  some movies obviously exist only to put wares on the screen and to do that , less talented people are used .  there aren't enough great directors and actors to create the number of films necessary .  for some reason , it's never crossed anyone's mind that the real equation is quality films = more profit .  often , mediocre films are more of a pain for the audience than the horrendous ones .  at you can have a good time making fun of bad movies .  i'm not suggesting that "" patch adams "" was tossed out just to rake in the bucks .  my guess is that someone was asleep at the wheel .  it features an accomplished actor and a potentially engrossing story , but it's as dull as could be .  hunter "" patch "" adams' ( robin williams ) desire to become a doctor has an unusual genesis .  checking himself into a mental institute after a suicide attempt , he discovers that he can help the other patients by clowning around .  patch could be a poster boy for co-dependency .  he explains that he likes devoting himself to others because then he doesn't focus on his own problems .  he decides that he wants to be a physician , leaves the place and a couple of years later enrolls in the medical college of virginia .  as a med student , patch's antics at the school's hospital catch the attention of his soon to be arch-enemy , straight-laced dean walcott ( bob gunton ) .  the dean is so opposed to the goofiness that he wants patch kicked out of school although he's one of the top students .  he writes in patch's academic file that he shows "" excessive happiness . ""  i walked into the film knowing little about its history and wondered about its odd mechanical pacing .  there also seemed to be no reason that it is set in the early seventies .  then it struck me .  it must be based on a true story .  the movie is an adaptation of a book by hunter adams who founded the gesundheit institute , a free clinic .  robin williams is an amazing actor .  while he is adept at dramatic roles , his forte is over-the-top free spirits .  that's what makes his failure here so remarkable .  patch is exactly the character he should be best at , yet even the scene where he and another mental patient are battling fierce imaginary squirrels falls flat .  something holds him back .  most of the rest of the cast is two-dimensional .  for a film that champions seeing patients as human beings , it's curious that the ones here are cardboard characters .  peter coyote as a man dying of cancer is refreshing because he seems like a real person .  unfortunately he's in the film for only about two minutes .  the audience is blatantly lead by a ring in its nose from scene to scene .  we're not left to our own emotional decisions : we're hit over the head with them .  shaved-headed children with cancer , an elderly woman whom patch makes laugh , a beautiful woman who can't love because of her abusive history .  when a group of students fix up an old house to use as a clinic in the andy hardy "" hey , let's put on a play !  we can use the barn and my mom can make the curtains ! ""  mode , they laugh and roll around while painting each other .  there might as well be giant signs flashing : "" feel good now ! ""   "" feel bad now ! ""   "" patch "" is a good title for the film .  it is a patchwork of every manipulative scene you can think of .  the full-of-life student fights stodgy establishment types .  there's a touching death .  then there's another .  the film doesn't trust us to get it the first time .  the dean tries to kick patch out and later he tries again .  worst of all is the final courtroom bit .  scary-looking old men sit in judgment of a man who only wants to help people .  the room is packed with patch's supporters .  williams makes a supposedly impassioned speech about the humanity of all .  it has as much emotion as his earlier statement "" humans are the only animal that kills members of its own species "" contains truth .  most of the blame must be placed with the director tom shadyac and screenwriter steve oedekerk .  shadyac also directed the first "" ace ventura "" movie .  oedekerk directed the second one .  need i say more ?  the real adams is to be admired for his devotion to treating patients as people rather than diseases .  the film has a number of worthy messages about the state of the modern medical business with hmos and managed care .  the "" doctors are not gods "" theme will resonate with a number of people , but it's so poorly produced that no one will care .

0|"one of the first films of 1999 is this mtv pictures release which marks the first leading feature role for james van der beek , the star of the wb's runaway hit dawson's creek .  following in the foot steps of mtv's two other live action films , joe's apartment ( 1996 ) and dead man on campus ( 1998 ) , varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace .  set in west cannan , texas , the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john "" mox "" moxon ( van der beek ) .  we know he's smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook .  coach bud kilmer ( jon voight ) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him .  the star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , is a handsome , blonde , hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader , darcy ( ali larter ) .  also on the team are an enormous guy ( ron lester ) with some health problems and the token african-american team member ( eliel swinton ) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin .  when lance is seriously injured , mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it , undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies .  his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend , jules ( amy smart ) , is threatened and there's a big game at the end .  guess who wins ?  nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love .  there's a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow .  van der beek does a decent job of carrying his first film although a silly accent trips him up sometimes .  also , the role isn't very much of a stretch from his dawson leary character .  he's still a pseudo-intellectual , whiny , nice guy , except here he also happens to be a jock .  voight is a terror as he chews up every single piece of scenery and spits it out .  the other adults are all notably awful while the younger performers don't fare much better .  on the positive side , walker is a charismatic actor who is due for a breakout role following this and his supporting turn in pleasantville ( 1998 ) .  scott ( son of james ) caan has some lively moments as tweeder , the team's wild man .  larter , as a gorgeous seductress looking for a one way ticket out of texas , gets to show off the film's most interesting costumes , including a very eye-opening "" whipped cream bikini . ""  it's interesting to note that the film definitely earns its r-rating with a lot of harsh language , alcohol abuse and an unusually high amount of nudity ( including a gratuitous trip to a strip bar that reveals a not very surprising surprise ) .  all this is likely to come as a shock to the young female fan base of dawson's creek , presumably the target audience for the picture .  director brian robbins previously helmed the kids feature good burger ( from nickelodeon films , a sister company of mtv ) and changes directions here a bit but still fails to make much of an impression .  the look of the movie is as bland as the town and characters who populate it .  the football scenes are generally unexciting and the entire film looks a bit washed out .  there's an ok soundtrack featuring music from collective soul , foo fighters , green day and aaliyah but it's not as impressive as one would expect from a mtv film .

0|"susan granger's review of "" america's sweethearts "" ( columbia/sony )  what a waste of a talented cast !  billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan have concocted a sly , provocative premise and , as the opening credits roll , it's obvious that they're attempting an old-fashioned romantic comedy .  the story involves a veteran publicist ( billy crystal ) who is summoned to orchestrate a press junket in las vegas when an arrogant director ( christopher walken ) holds a megabuck movie hostage in his editing room , refusing to show it to anyone .  he figures that by giving the journalists juicy hints of a possible reconciliation between the film's once-married-but-now-estranged stars , gwen and eddie ( catherine zeta-jones , john cusack ) , they'll be so distracted that they won't remember they didn't see the movie or it wasn't what they expected .   ( and crystal thought of this long before a sony exec concocted the phony critic/david manning quote scandal ! )  for help , he turns to gwen's personal assistant/sister ( julia roberts ) .  but the laughs are few and far-between .  crystal's glib , cynical flack isn't wickedly funny enough with a few amusing one-liners .  after six months under the care of a depak chopra-like guru ( alan arkin ) , cusack's character's too emotionally fragile , lacking the necessary charisma .  zeta-jones's vain , narcissistic diva is undeveloped and one-dimensional .  only hank azaria , as zeta-jones's much-macho spanish lover , and stanley tucci , as a studio exec , and roberts manage to whip up any farcical froth .  basically , we don't like these ego-driven , stereotypical characters , let alone root for them to unwind their romantic entanglements , and joe roth's direction is predictable , formulaic and telegraphic .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" america's sweethearts "" is a contrived , shallow 4 . as a screwball satire , it's strictly superficial .

0|"this independent film written and directed by eric bross has the look and feel of all those other troubled blue-collar youth films that have inundated the market in recent times .  it is hard to tell what is independent about this film ; it might as well have been made in hollywood or on a home videocam .  it is the debut film for the director , who tells his personal story about italians growing up with heavy new jersey accents and remaining tight with each other as they grow into young adults , a tale which could have been rewarding to see in the 1950s , where the mind-set of all the characters depicted is grounded , but to see it in the 1990s is a different story : it is old news .  the love story between the simple girl waiting to get married and her luckless boyfriend turning nasty on her doesn't mean much , since their relationship remained undeveloped .  the introduction of the wise-guy angle and the loyality among buddies bit , are not moving enough emotional experiences or intelligent enough dramatics to elevate this film above its limited story line despite the tour-de-force performance by the star of the film , adrien brody as ray .  ray is the only son of a low-level mobster once arrested for running an illegal casino operation out of his bloomfield , new jersey , suburban basement .  ray sr . ( vincent ) is now trying to make a go of it by running a small scale home-repair business .  his son lives with him and works unhappily as a shoe salesman , dreaming of getting rich quickly so he can open a business and marry his long-time waitress girlfriend joanne ( sybil ) .  the title of this film refers to the shoe size of paul newman-10b , which really has nothing to do with explaining anything about the film . you  should be aware that there are a lot of things about this film that don't make sense : its constant brainless chatter between the buddies , their uneventful growing pains , and the despair of their lives , make it very difficult to feel any empathy for them .  desperate to make his dream come through , ray goes to a loanshark , humorously and menacingly played by james e . moriarty , and borrows 10 grand to bet on a "" sure thing "" at freehold raceway .  the horse loses and now ray has big problems , as the loanshark comes after him with his muscle to get his dough .  there is nothing i have seen so far to like about ray .  he is undependable , mean-spirited , and stupid .  so when his best friend mike ( gallagher ) , the narrator of the film , gets a chance to sleep with his girlfriend--who cares ?  the director must be kidding himself if he thinks we do .  as for ray's gambling debt and his dilemma of how to pay it off , the story is too predictable for anything other than what you would expect to happen .  his buddies , the college student mike and the dependable butchie ( gillan ) , and his old man , who he has this love/hate relationship with , rally to his aid .  and the film ends on an obligatory artistic note of ambiguity , that seems to be the way it is for all those wannabe artistic films , as ray is off to florida all by his lonesome self to try to put his life together .  there was just no energy or spark or anything relevant in this superficial film to keep it interesting , though adrien brody showed signs that he could be a future star .  because of his intensity and looks , he reminds me of sean penn .
