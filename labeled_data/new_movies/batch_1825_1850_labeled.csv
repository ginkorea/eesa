0|"written by alex cox , tod davies , terry gilliam and tony grisoni  directed by terry gilliam  i've always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid .  dropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last .  then there's the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose .  mushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing .  acid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy .  my point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie .  full of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s . thompson's book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out .  but for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag .  fear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed "" gonzo "" journalist hunter s . thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney's convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971 .  operating under the pseudonyms of "" raoul duke "" and "" dr .  gonzo "" , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers .  they terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them .  duke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge .  dr . gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane's "" white rabbit "" reaches its climax .  and these guys don't just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead .  that neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view .  thompson's book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document .  it simultaneously exposed the 60's drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die .  pontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson's message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy .  it's a cheech and chong movie .  you're there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results : see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down .  there's nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard .  this is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes .  there are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen .  but to what end ?  much of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson's book , and there are some priceless comic observations .  but you're hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work .  this brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong .  depp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson's dialogue .  in between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost .  watching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see .  it's interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over .  as much of a fan as i am of gilliam's work , cox would have been the better choice .  sid and nancy , cox's best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film .  gilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose .  what kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ?  it doesn't try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn't work as broad comedy .  if he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film .  but i don't want to be too hard on it .  there are some truly funny moments , and if you're in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it .  i do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect .

0|"i had an epiphany today .  it occurred to me while i was watching "" house on haunted hill . ""  it is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it's advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ?  chances are , there * is * truth in advertising .  too bad i didn't trust my own instincts when something-or-the-other possessed me to see this movie .  i blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of "" sleepy hollow .

0|"one of the most blatantly obvious signs that often-acclaimed director sidney lumet's "" gloria , "" a remake of the 1980 john cassavetes film , had absolutely no effect on me occurred when i was driving home from the theatre .  suddenly , i realized that since i had stood up from my theatre seat five minutes before , i had not thought once about the film i had just invested nearly two hours of my life in .  when a movie is over , aren't we supposed to think about it for a while , and have a conversation about it with the acquaintances we have just watched it with ?  i thought so , but , for one , i saw this particular picture by myself , and #2 , even if i had been with someone there wouldn't have been anything to talk about in the first place .  to be sure , "" gloria "" begins with a stirring , rather poignant prologue in which a seven-year-old boy's family is brutally gunned down by mobsters , in search of a disc his father had with incriminating evidence on it .  right before the men broke in , of course , his father gave him the disc to escape with .  eventually , the boy , named nicky nunez ( jean-luke figueroa ) , is caught by the mobsters , and taken back to their apartment .  meanwhile , gloria ( sharon stone ) has just gotten out of prison for a crime she didn't commit and returns to her ex-boyfriend ( jeremy northam ) to recieve the money he promised her for covering up his crime .  when he refuses to give it to her , and then hears the group of men talking about killing nicky , she leaves with him in order to save his life , but not before holding the men at gunpoint , stealing all of their money , and forcing them to strip nude .  gloria is the type of fast-talking , smart-mouthed new yorker who always seems to get involved with the wrong people , and she never expected to be stuck with a kid , but she has a heart of gold ( don't they always in this type of movie ) and is only trying to protect the boy , whom she quickly begins to form a close bond with .  the previous incarnation of "" gloria "" by cassavetes and starring the luminous gena rowlands , remains unseen by me , but was no doubt superior , even though i can't really imagine how this considerably dull story could be transformed into an entertaining one , regardless of the director or stars .  there is no doubt in my mind that director lumet has stuck closely to the original , but the film itself is simply lifeless , with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn't completely unbearable to watch .  i liked , for example , a very funny climactic sequence where gloria is deciding whether to leave the school she has left the boy at , and keeps turning the car around , then driving a little ways , then slamming on the brakes and turning around again .  these bright moments , however , appear long and far between , and the majority of the film deals with the budding relationship between nicky and gloria , which is both painfully predictable and by-the-numbers .  throughout , my mind was repeatedly asking the question , "" who really cares ? ""  as gloria , sharon stone has adopted an over-the-top brooklyn accent that honestly doesn't sound realistic at all .  in the beginning , in fact , i was amazed at how amateurish stone's performance was , but as the film progressed she got better .  although not one of her better turns , stone does have a comic flare that refuses to be ignored .  jean-luke figeroa was fine as nicky and a little more natural than the usual child actors who are so precocious they make you want to gag .  all other actors who appeared were considerably wasted , none more than cathy moriarty , an entertaining actress in her own right , who is billed fourth and has all of one scene , as gloria's friend whom she turns to for help .  sony , the studio that released "" gloria , "" obviously does not have any faith in the film , and i don't blame them .  they declined to screen the picture for critics , which is never a good sign , particularly with the high-profile people involved .  although how much money a movie makes does not determine how good it is ( just look at the spectacular "" in dreams , "" which failed to even make the top 10 last week ) , i have a suspicion "" gloria "" is going to vanish from theaters faster than "" ishtar , "" judging from the opening night 7 : 00 p . m . showing i saw it at , where there were about ten to fifteen people present , counting myself .  although stone can be an impressive actress ( just watch her in 1995's "" casino "" or 1996's "" last dance "" if you don't believe me ) and sidney lumet can be a respectable director , there is no reasoning for why they thought the cliched story of "" gloria "" was worth remaking or , for that matter , why columbia pictures agreed to finance it when they could have been making a picture that actually looked like it might have an inkling of a chance to be successful .

0|"pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is "" sex "" , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review .  because of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of "" sex "" ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it's most likely just another way of referring to "" sex "" .  i think we'd all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review .  though not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what .  body shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you'd normally expect to see a violent attack .  it's about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it .  these are things we all do , sometimes .  the characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts .  their lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed .  it's as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek .  at its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition .  michael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say .  his characters don't communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera .  they voice simplistic platitudes like "" i like to come "" or "" sex without love equals violence "" .  huh ?  and yes that is as complex as this movie's observations get .  the characters are stupid and shallow , with not one registering as anything more .  the plot concerns vapid over sexed twentysomethings on an all night hunt for carnal pleasure , then the after math ( the morning after ) of such events .  we meet the characters as they speak directly to us , confiding in us with their idiotic ruminations on intimacy .  i would normally go into the characters and the actors who play them , giving you the pros and cons , but for this film i cannot .  i'm not trying to be clever or witty , but i honestly hardly remember anything that would set them apart from the others .  with the exception of trent ( played by ron livingston as a bargain basement patrick bateman ) , the rest fade into each other-- a patchwork of fake breasts , defined abs , pearly white teeth , and creamy , flawless skin .  i vaguely recall brad rowe as the sensitive one , only because his character gets the worst lines ( "" sex without love equals violence "" ) .  in between all the confessionals , cristoffer films everything like a headache commercial , with blurry slo mos and dramatic head turning .  the fact that this director at one point won a pulitzer prize completely baffles me .  this film is made without one iota of intelligence or insight into the generation that its tag line claims to be defining .  if body shots is meant to say that all twentysometyhings are idiotic and f * * k-obsessed , fine , i don't have any problem with a film that tries to persuade me to think a certain way , but cristoffer only gives us one side .  additionally that one side isn't even entertaining ; the characters indulge in buggery without an ounce of sexiness .  or realism .  one sexual encounter takes place outside a club on a chain link fence between the two most sensitive characters .  they suddenly have vigorous intercourse with each other for no apparent reason ( other than that they both happen to be standing next to each other ? ? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn't it erotic , it isn't real .  it doesn't feel like an authentic sexual encounter .  every f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner .  body shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film .  it shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it .  the resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow .  the main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred .  the film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off .  this is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can't think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80's next to wall street .  unfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off .  paul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded .  it was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall-out of such a decision .  the characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them .  he gave them heart .  cristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones .  he preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us .  this is not the way to get any message across .  why not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin' skins ?  cristofer kind of does that , though without an ounce of insight , and with a helping of leering exploitation .

0|"i'm guessing -- and from the available evidence , it's not a great guess -- that burn hollywood burn began life as an insider satire of hollywood excess , stupidity , ego and power-mongering .  if so , the film that ended up on the screen ranks as one of the most spectacularly ironic unintentional jokes in film history .  it has already been well-documented that the original title , an alan smithee film , became a problem when miserable test screenings forced re-cuts against the will of director arthur hiller , prompting hiller himself to opt for the directors' guild-mandated pseudonym of alan smithee .  that left a film satire in the hands of writer joe eszterhas , as humorless a hack as ever put finger to word processor .  and you could just smell the disaster brewing .  if you're unfortunate enough to sit through burn hollywood burn , you'll still be smelling that disaster long after the lights come up .  ostensibly , it's a pseudo-documentary account of a director named alan smithee ( eric idle ) who loses control of a big-budget action film called trio starring sylvester stallone , whoopi goldberg and jackie chan ( all of whom appear as themselves ) .  when the only recourse available to him is abandoning the project to be called "" an alan smithee film "" -- which , of course , it already is -- smithee steals the negative of the film and threatens to destroy it .  among the parties interviewed are the film's producer james edmunds ( ryan o'neal ) and studio boss jerry glover ( richard jeni ) , who spend virtually the entire film narrating the story while painfully unfunny things go on around them .  it's bad enough that burn hollywood burn has -- literally -- not a single laugh for its entire , blissfully brief 84 minutes .  what makes it even worse is eszterhas' insistence upon telling every bad joke not once , but twice or even three times .  michael ovitz references , showgirls references , oral sex references , whoopi goldberg/ted danson references -- all show up multiple times with all the subtlety that is eszterhas' stock-in-trade .  the reduncancy even manages to turn actively offensive with some frequency , notably with the hilarious use of the word "" feminist "" as an identifying caption for every single female character in the film .  by the time coolio and chuck d show up as black independent film-makers the brothers brothers ( cleverly identified as "" bad a-- "" and "" badder a-- "" , among other unprintable things ) , you may be ready to walk out of the theater with your coat over your head to avoid being identified .  those documentary captions , for all their leaden obviousness , allow the best insight into what's so hideously wrong with burn hollywood burn .  not content to stick any hollywood type with only one jab from his rapier wit , eszterhas fills the screen with bullet points every time a new character appears .  the producer is a "" liar "" who "" slept in the white house ; "" the media are "" maggots "" and "" leeches "" working for publications like "" the new york slimes "" and "" newsleak "" ( with the camera zooming in on the altered title to make sure you don't miss the joke ) .  it doesn't even matter that eszterhas tags "" penile implant "" after his own name when he makes a cameo , because it seems like such a desperate attempt to feign self-deprecation .  this is a petulant schoolboy's idea of satire -- pictures of hollywood insiders to which eszterhas has taken a pen to draw little moustaches and black out the teeth .  the last stomach-churning straw comes when burn hollywood burn closes with out-takes over the closing credits , the kind that show the audience how much fun everyone was having making the film that just sucked an hour and a half of your life away .  perhaps it was just a final , desperate attempt by eszterhas to convince himself there was some purpose behind the film , or to convince everyone involved that a few blown lines warranted threatening to blow their whole career .  pity everyone involved with this excessive , ego-driven "" satire "" of excess and ego .  it's too bad that only directors can remove their names from noxious material like this .  otherwise , you might have seen credits for burn hollywood burn overflowing with alan smithees .

0|" "" meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood ! , ""  screams the television ads for "" hanging up , "" disastrously written by real-life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton .  make me laugh again !  not only is "" hanging up "" misadvertised , since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two co-stars , lisa kudrow and diane keaton , little more than extended cameos , but they don't actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes .  and we are supposed to believe their strong bond , and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship , despite them being apart for the majority of the running time ?  excuse me , again , while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion .  eve marks ( meg ryan ) is the middle mozzell sister , still living in the california town where she grew up , and with a husband ( adam arkin ) and pre-teen son ( jesse james ) .  her elderly , wisecracking father , lou ( walter matthau , in his brightest performance in years ) has just recently been put into the hospital , in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimer's ( even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him ) .  while eve's relationship with her mother ( cloris leachman ) is nearly nonexistent , since she ran out on lou and her children years ago , she has had her fair share of up's and down's with lou , who used to be an alcoholic .  her older sister is georgia ( diane keaton ) , an editor for the self-titled magazine , "" georgia , "" while maddy ( lisa kudrow ) is the youngest , a soap opera actress .  interestingly , their professions are given , but we not once ever see them working at their jobs , or , for that matter , learn much of anything about them .  maddy , georgia , and eve do not see each other much anymore , their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart , but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another .  and they talk .  and talk .  and talk . . .  in fact , the telephone is the major star of the film , even more so than ryan , as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92-minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long .  if you are able to get through the opening half-hour , in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them , you will surely survive the rest .  the question is , who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating , self-involved pat-on-the-back ?  how could a comedy-drama that has the star-power of meg ryan , lisa kudrow , and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways ?  issues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up , but the film isn't mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner , and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood , it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought .  also , it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another , but no dynamic metamorphosizes .  and when they do reunite in the finale , their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three-minute scene in which they argue like little children .  you can see the impending death coming a mile away , and it conveniently occurs in the next scene , so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves , and with each other .  you think to yourself : "" the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food-fight , "" and like clockwork , it also occurs by the end credits .  meg ryan is a versatile actress ( look no further than 1998's "" hurlyburly "" or 1994's "" when a man loves a woman "" ) , despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies .  with "" hanging up , "" the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron , a writer/director/hack who shouldn't be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big-budget , high-profile debacle .  even if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department , she nonetheless is very good , and the two scenes that work , flashbacks to christmas 1988 , when she had a heartbreaking run-in with her mother , and to halloween 1993 , when lou crashed her son's birthday party in a drunken stupor , are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations .  diane keaton , as georgia , is better as an actress than a director here , but that is a wildly feeble compliment .  what is more than a little far-fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow , although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children , she is no more than five years ryan's senior .  yeah , right .  lastly , poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a big-screen venture , after her even more thin role in 1999's "" analyze this . ""  kudrow isn't given enough time to create a full personality with maddy , so it isn't her fault she doesn't register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue .  if anything , though , kudrow is a real talent , and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time , as in her brilliantly nuanced , oscar-caliber work in 1998's "" the opposite of sex . ""  if you are a fan of kudrow's ( and who isn't ? ) , do yourself a favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than "" hanging up "" does in its entirety .  as eve's hardworking husband , adam arkin is , predictably , squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do , until a subplot reveals itself midway through , only to never be mentioned again .  cloris leachman , as with ryan and matthau , makes a small , but noticeable impression with her , albeit , very brief appearance , while edie mcclurg , as a rosy-cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback , manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production .  nearly all the emotions displayed within "" hanging up "" are patently manufactured , and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters , aside from eve , why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats ?  if , for some bizarre , "" twilight zone "" -type of reason , you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film , my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over .  saying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions .

0|"under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review .  however , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary .  even though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk .  the movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm's past patients .  distraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself .  cut to the "" next fall "" , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i didn't want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) .  after about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has "" the sixth sense "" , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead .  and this , as they say , is where the healing begins .  the sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert's colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of "" siskel and ebert "" ) .  although i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i've always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one .  here , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film's conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i've fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated .  and indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment .  stripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion .  after seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power .  it's a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature-length movie .  in fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth-shattering revelation that is yet to come .  and when the final moments do come , it's a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all .  it stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level .  i won't go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder .  now , in all fairness , i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand .  however , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few "" twilight zone "" episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away .  the fact that movie-goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped .  ironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl's funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy .  i wouldn't have even known about this mental disease if i hadn't , by pure dumb luck , caught "" dateline nbc "" the other week when they did a feature story on it .  despite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk-full of contradictions and just isn't plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation .

0|"a disappointing biography about the homosexual relationship of two famous 19th century french poets .  the film managed to remove all the poetry from the poets and instead concentrated on their abrasive personalities .  the result is merely an academic exercise , leaving an emotional vacuum that it couldn't build on to show them as the poets they were .  on paper , this shouldn't have been so terrible -- it had a talented director in agnieszka holland ( "" the secret garden "" ) , a proven screenwriter in christopher hampton ( dangerous liaisons ) , and a capable cast .  but the film was done in by its inept script , the unappealing way the film was directed , and the miscasting of leonardo dicaprio as rimbaud .  i found his performance to be the most risible one in the film , with him acting more like a teenage brat than a young genius , spouting obsenities without giving a hint that a true poet lies behind that facade .  he , especially , looked bad because david thewlis as paul verlaine looked so good despite the turgid dialogue that was thrust upon him and how thin a character he was forced to be .  but when the two of them were together , it looked like a mismatch .  leonardo's rimbaud only made the young poet look petulant and crude , yet we know from rimbaud's poetry , that he must have had something going for him because his poetry was awe inspiring .  the film opens in post-revolutionary france in 1871 , the 16-year-old rimbaud has sent the established symbolist poet verlaine a letter with his poems .  he accepts verlaine's praises and invitation to be a house guest in his splendid paris home , and rimbaud leaves his sullen farm in rural charleville .  once there , rimbaud is disappointed in the bourgeoisie household , has an immediate conflict with verlaine's busty 18-year-old wife mathilde ( romane ) , and finds to his regret that the drunken verlaine loves his rich wife for her body and that he lives off her family's money , even though he has nothing else in common with her .  when verlaine states , "" poets can learn from one another , "" rimbaud replies in a haughty tone , "" only if they're bad poets . ""  he will continue to treat the older poet like dirt for the rest of their relationship .  verlaine proves to be weak-willed , beating his wife regularly , and plays just as despicable a character as rimbaud .  when mathilde's father kicks rimbaud out of the house , verlaine finds him in a rooming house and the two become lovers .  it's a real downer to watch this story unfold into a series of obnoxious behavior patterns on the part of the two poets , which leads them to traveling together and mathilde asking for a divorce .  in brussels , verlaine gets arrested for sodomy and spends two years in jail .  while rimbaud becomes angered at the literary world and never writes another poem after he becomes 19 .  he instead goes to north africa and becomes an adventurer and a gun-runner , and after ten years there , comes home with a tumor on his knee and dies a changed man at the age of 37 .  the hopeless relationship between the two is what the picture covers in detail and that was not very satisfying .  the film ends on a whimper . . . with  verlaine talking with rimbaud's sister about her brother and the poems of his he still possesses , which the sister wants destroyed so as not to embarrass the family or ruin the name of her deceased brother if published .  this film was especially annoying because rimbaud's poems are filled with a visionary tenseness that are not even approached in this film , as the film only manages to skim the surface of the lives of these poets and completely ignores the value of their poetry .  i have no idea what the filmmaker was trying to say in this film , but whatever it was , it just didn't work .  it certainly didn't bring any light into understanding what rimbaud meant to modern poetry and why he earned the reputation as the so-called father of modern poetry .

0|in our time .  in our modern world , where the cool rule , it's hard to imagine that shakespeare is becoming 'the man' .  and yet - film after film , after film , is based on his everlasting magic .  in warner brothers' latest production , shakespeare is kicking ass to a rap beat , while his magic and intelligence slowly fades away .  though the producers of the matrix have vaguely based their picture on william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet' , its title sequence with a frightening rap song and a black limo making its way through the dark streets of new york , is very hard to associate with shakespeare's poetry .  the film takes place during a silent war between the two major mafia families in the city - the afro americans against the chinese .  the youngest son of a chinese mafia chieftain is found murdered .  the afro-americans are immediately suspected , but a peace treaty is signed between the two godfathers .  it is at this point that han ( the romeo of the story ) finds out about his brother's death .  escaping from a prison in china , he returns to united states to avenge his brother's fate .  but before he can restore justice with his kung fu kicks , he falls in love with a mysterious beauty .  the only problem is that she is the daughter of his enemy . .  there's only a weak echo of shakespeare's talent in this disappointing production .  and there are more problems besides its title .  of course we don't call it a deformation of a great masterpiece .  we call it 'modernization' .  it seems that the producers fear that the audience will not respond to lyrics , without any car chases and gun fights .  this lack of respect for the audience i find very disturbing .  kenneth brannagh has already proven that shakespeare doesn't need to be updated , because his tales are grounded in the basics of life and human nature .  and as long as love , hate , honesty and corruption do exist , everyone will understand and embrace shakespeare .  i must admit that i found 'rome must die' very confusing .  i can forgive andrzej bartkowiak , since it is his first attempt at directing .  he manages to create an incredible atmosphere and directs with a firm precision .  unfortunately he completely forgot about character- and story developments .  his latest picture is therefore visually impressive , but intellectually hollow .  the love story between han ( jet li ) and trish ( aalyah ) , and the mafia intrigues are undeveloped and simplified .  jet li is one of the most amazing fighters to ever hit the silver screen and aalyah has a magical voice .  their achievement save this film from being completely braindead , but they are not actors , and therefore can not act .  they are nothing more than two celebrities put together .  the other actors , including isaiah washington , russell wong , henry o and dmx all give the standard mediocre performances .  delroy lindo is the only one that projects a coherent image of reality .  but there's more than acting to worry about .  even with li's incredible skills in martial arts , the action scenes ( though technically excellent ) are too long and story updates simply embarrassing .  to make a long story short : 'romeo must die' is not intelligent enough to be a thriller , not sensual enough to be a love story and too serious to be a fun action film .  it is certain that bartkowiak would be much better off with o this embarrassing and completely unnecessary parallel to 'romeo and juliet' , so the film is completely stuck - not sure of what to be .  and in the end it's nothing .  there are no performances worthy of notice , no interesting character- or story surprises .  so again , the only good thing about it is its technical achievement .  this film can boast of great sound , fast paced editing , solid cinematography and some very well coordinated action sequences .  the music is another factor that prevents you from leaving the theatre .  it is mostly provided by aalyah's enchanting voice and several carefully inserted rap songs by various artists , that create a kind of 'ghetto feel' to it .  but when i think back , it's not much i remember from this 'production' .  as in almost every summer movie , there are some interesting scenes , but most of the moments that i remember are associated with massive special effects .  it is not a film that will get any attention for its artistic qualities , simply because it doesn't have any .  for someone who has never read shakespeare , it's another popcorn film .  for those of us who has , it's a waste of money , time and brain cells .  |-0.3|0.8000000000000002|0.7666666666666666|The sentiment in the explanations is mostly negative, with the authors expressing disappointment in the film's lack of respect for Shakespeare's work, confusing plot, undeveloped characters, and lack of intelligence in the storytelling.

0|"a movie about divorce and custody in 1995 seems about as timely as a movie about mood rings .  family breakups have been an all too familiar part of the american landscape for nearly thirty years , and countless dramas have told stories of acrimonious court battles in hand-wringing detail .  still , i can't recall a comedy about the subject before bye bye love .  and after it , i still can't .  bye bye love is rarely funny , more often a weak and melodramatic retread of common tv-movie fare .  only a few moments which have nothing to do with the film's main premise offer big laughs instead of cliched emotion .  bye bye love follows one weekend in the lives of three divorced fathers who get weekend custody of their children .  dave ( matthew modine ) , a father of two , is an inveterate womanizer having difficulty staying faithful to his latest girlfriend ; vic ( randy quaid ) is a foul-humored father of three about to go on a rare date ; donny ( paul reiser ) pines for his ex-wife and has trouble relating to his teenage daughter emma ( eliza dushku ) .  over the course of the weekend , the three men face various crises , including vic's blind date from hell ( janeane garofolo ) and donny's growing estrangement from emma .  the three lead actors form a rather unlikely combo , and the quality of their performances is of widely varying quality .  randy quaid is the best of the three , bitter without being irritating , gleefully spiteful without being frightening .  his run-ins with is ex-wife ( lindsey crouse ) are a bit over-played , though , and his confrontation with a pompous radio psychologist ( rob reiner ) is gimmicky and implausible .  he does get bye bye love's best sub-plot , a hilarious dinner date with a gloriously demented janeane garofolo , and he does a great slow burn .  paul reiser really has only one character , his slightly befuddled , uptight nice guy "" mad about you "" persona , but he does it well .  as a personality , he is appealing , but as a character , he becomes pretty boring here .  matthew modine , is , quite simply , terrible .  this isn't a performance good enough to be called mailed-in ; he even forgot to put a stamp on it .  modine lacks any charm in an appallingly under-written role , looks bored most of the time , and gets stuck with a trite little speech about how it's all his father's fault he's such a cad .  carolco's executives , whose entire future is resting on modine's bankability for the upcoming cutthroat island , must be sweating buckets right now .  bye bye love basically comes off as a very confused movie , because it spends far too much of its time on the new relationships of its main characters instead of on the relationships between the fathers and their kids , making it just another "" dating in the 90s "" movie .  when the movie does deal with the children at all , it is to have one of them scream out an accusation and/or cry , perhaps to be resolved later by a sensitive talk and a hug , perhaps not .  even more confusing is a sub-plot featuring the late ed flanders as a widower who goes to work and a mcdonald's and befriends a troubled youth .  it is a sad end to flanders' career , getting caught up in a truly annoying over-use of mcdonald's as a location , a plot device and , apparently , a major advertiser .  even if bye bye love had decided to spend its time focusing exclusively on the parent-child relationships , it still would have been pretty difficult to pull off , because ultimately there is very little humor one can wring from family break-ups and their effects on children .  any way you slice it , it is a bad situation for kids , and the makers of bye bye love mostly go for the heartstrings when dealing with the single parenting issue .  it is left to the dads' romantic fumblings to probide what little humor there is , and it isn't enough .  there have been comparisons between bye bye love and parenthood , but parenthood was both genuinely funny and genuinely touching .  bye bye love is a genuine shame .

0|"according to the publicity material , with this movie the directors "" hope to restore good old-fashioned bowling to its rightful place in the mainstream of american consciousness . ""  hmm .  you never know , they just might be on to something .  what with the rise of geek chic , lounge music and seventies fashion , the ever-contrary kids of the nineties might just latch on to bowling as another terminally unhip bastion of tackyana to claim as their own .  but then , i doubt if kingpin will have anything to do with it .  it's cheesy all right , but connoisseurs of bad taste will find this film exudes that bland smell of stale jokes rather than the invigorating stink of true kitsch .  that's a shame , because , in the first ten minutes or so the film promises to be a lot more .  woody harrelson plays the hotshot bowler on the rise , roy munson .  the movie opens in the fifties with roy's dad dishing out the reader's digest/gumpian wisdom in scoopfuls , shifting to the 70s for a hilarious spoof of saturday night fever .  the sardonic tone of the proceedings is much enhanced by the presence of bill murray , as the delectably slimy big ern mcracken .  it's thanks to murray that the first quarter of kingpin seems so good - he gives the wry , derisive edge to this otherwise rather unfocused comedy .  mccracken dupes munson into a hustling job , then abandons him to an angry mob who mangle roy's hand .  then it's fast forward 17 years later when munson is a fat , balding loser with a prosthetic rubber hand .  he's hopeless until he meets ishmael ( randy quaid ) , an amish amateur bowler that munson takes on as protege .  so together they set out for the million dollar bowling tournament in reno , picking up pretty hustler claudia ( vanessa angel ) on the way .  with the exit of bill murray , the filmmakers seem to have only one direction to go , and that's . . .  dumb and dumber .  yes , indeed , kingpin is brought to you by those modern proponents of laxative humour , peter and bobby farrelly , the directors of the aforementioned jim carrey vehicle .  so , prepare for much slaparound comedy with flying rubber hands , distended nipples , ridiculous hair and bull semen .  get set for stock fish-out-of-water situations when city-boy roy puts on a beard and tries to blend in with the amish community , or when suaku straitlaced ishmael takes on smoking , striptease and unchristian neighbour-socking .  now , don't get me wrong , there's nothing wrong with cheap humour , and i had my fair share of lavatorial laughs with woody and randy .  the trouble is that these jokes aren't bold or funny enough to drive a movie that bumbles along without much sense of direction .  it lurches from sports movie to amish-mocking to road-trip to sentimental melodrama , ( pausing for a broadside spoof of indecent proposal , and many shameless plugs for the accompanying pop soundtrack ) , never quite getting it all together .  some gags fall flat from a lack of build-up , while there are bits and pieces in the movie that simply don't do anything .  why the long , unfunny fight in the car park ?  why two of these ?  why does that guy wear mascara , or that guy have a glass bowling ball with a rose in it ?  the film is full of these half-thought-through ideas that give the impression of any old gaffer , grip or makeup artist throwing in random stuff and saying , "" wouldn't that be funny ? "" .  well , no , actually .  the actors don't do the movie much favours either .  woody harrelson comes off okay , plausibly acting dumb , smart , cynical or innocent when the implausible script calls for it , but randy quaid is a ceaseless ham , and vanessa angel has no talent ( like schwarzenegger , she seems more convincing playing a computer-creation than a human -- take the tv series weird science . . . please   ) .  even murray hams it up when he reappears in the movie's climax .  all in all , a fairly useless attempt at comedy , and a certified no-hoper at kickstarting the bowling renaissance .  we'll have to look to a reinspired john waters , or perhaps somebody from down under ( "" strictly bowling "" , anyone ? ) for the definitive bowling comedy .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

"" how can a movie have guest stars ? ""  you may ask .  well , blade squad is not really a movie so to speak but a 2 hour pilot for a possible tv series packaged as a movie .  blade squad is dumb .  blade squad is loud .  blade squad is obnoxious .  blade squad will probably be a ratings hit and spawn a long-lived tv series .  why not ?  after all , television has given its audience crimefighters with talking cars ( "" knight rider "" ) , fast helicopters ( "" airwolf "" ) , and super fast motorcycles ( "" street hawk "" ) , and viewers have eaten it up in the past .  so , why not crimefighters with jet-powered roller blades ?  to be honest , as a made-for-tv presentation , blade squad is at least watchable .  the film has a relatively large cast of characters , a surprisingly intelligible albeit predictable script , and enough action sequences to keep one half-interested .  i'd imagine adolescent males , probably the target audience of this turkey , would get a kick out of it .  i tried to keep that in mind when i watched blade squad .  i can remember liking "" airwolf "" and "" street hawk "" when i was 10 or 11 .  and , although this isn't saying much , blade squad is leaps and bounds better than the last fox network movie i had the displeasure of wasting time on : the insipidly awful generation x ( a huge disappointment considering the comic book's terrific two-year beginning ) .  but , i digress .  despite its limited appeal , blade squad has a lot of kinks to work out if the movie is to become a tv series .  one , it suffers from mtv syndrome : a lot of quick shots and weird angles continuously jar the viewer's senses while a near nonstop generic rock soundtrack blares incessantly in the background .  oh yeah , dylan's "" knockin' on heaven's door "" and bowie's "" i'm afraid of americans "" are used here , in rather poor taste .  two , blade squad needs a new crew for the sound .  the substandard sound editing irritated me to no end .  characters' dialogue , at times , sounded choppy and unintelligible .  during one important scene , a song played loudly in the background .  when a character spoke , the song's volume dropped but did not disappear .  as soon as that character finished speaking , the song's volume immediately returned to its original level until the next character spoke .  this sounds trivial , i'm sure , but it distracted me immensely .  finally , this is commercial television .  foul language is not allowed , typically , on commercial television .  thus , don't use foul language in a made-for-tv production because that foul language has to be censored in some manner .  in an early scene of the film , for example , the lead good guy and bad guy have a minor confrontation in the streets .  when the good guy spouts out a bad word , a driver conveniently honks his car's horn off-screen to muffle the word out .  in a "" seinfeld "" episode , this technique proved funny ; here , it seemed goofy and cut the dramatic tension considerably .  perhaps future writers , if a show is spun out of the movie , could take a cue from marvel comics' 2099 series of comics .  make up a bunch of new bad words for the future .  this way , you don't need a bunch of honking horns or other silly devices to cover up foul language .  compared to the usual crap broadcast tv networks have to offer in terms of movies , blade squad is a suitable exercise in camp .  when compared to , say , a movie studio film , blade squad has a lot in common with a term which shares its initials : bs .

0|"what a contrast !  in the space of two days , i saw shakespeare in love and hurlyburly .  i'm not sure you could get two more different movies .  while the former was all over the top , telegraphing everything , shoving its philosophy of life down our throats , hurlyburly was the complete opposite , wound so tight and with so much buried in its script , one could spend weeks thinking about it .  this is one interesting movie .  it's very much in a similar vein to one of my favourite movies of '98 , in the company of men , although not quite so nasty .  there's lots of talking and some scary insights into the world of men .  hurlyburly doens't contain much plot : we just follow eddie ( sean penn ) around as he tries to make sense of his life and the people around him .  his big question is : does it all pertain to him ?  and if it does , how is he supposed to feel about it all ?   "" it "" means everything : television , friends , events that happen .  i guess it could be summed up more crudely as : what's it all about ?  this is not a movie for answers .  donna ( anna paquin ) gives some but they're not really satisfying : they just lead to more questions .  that's what makes this movie stay on your mind .  these are the sorts of questions that occupy our time .  even when we push them to the background , however we resolve these questions influences everything we do .  the performances are all superb in hurlyburly .  i haven't seen sean penn in much before ( in fact , i can't remember seeing him in anything ) , but he is brilliant in this .  eddie isn't a likeable character , but sean penn makes him understandable .  i don't want to be his friend but i'd like to help him .  chazz palminteri is also great as phil , making him an awful person .  i'd never want to know phil but still i understand why eddie wants to be his friend .  everyone in this film nails their performances , making this world real .  it's a nasty world ; it's a sexist world .  unlike shakespeare in love which is unfailingly politically correct , hurlyburly is a man's world , seen unapologetically through the eyes of men .  i find this fascinating and on two counts , depressing .  first , it's depressing that such a world exists .  a large part of hurlyburly's success is that it convinces me that such people are real and that this sort of environment exists every day in hollywood ; that there are a large number of men out there who believe women to be completely peripheral to their world , toys , playthings .  sure , everyone is background to everyone else but in this world , women are a long way in the background .  second , these are the movies that are being made : stories about men's world .  where are the stories about women's world ?  not the soap operas and the "" chick flicks "" that are meant to satisfy women , but the real stories that touch on the essence of life like hurlyburly does for men .  hurlyburly is based on a stage play and that is evident from the moment the film starts .  it's very talkative , intelligent and static .  while this can make the film drag a bit , and people sometimes sound like they're quoting textbooks , mostly this is a good thing .  not all films have to be filled with special effects and sweeping panoramas .  not all films have to underestimate the intelligence of their audience .  all it means is that hurlyburly is probably just as effective on video as it is on the large screen .  it also means that you have to pay attention .

0|capsule : the running gag pair of characters from all of kevin smith's films gets their own movie .  the gags are sporadically funny .  it is more than occasionally funny for teens who are fond of scatological humor and anti-gay jokes .  the plot is weak and the leads are not a particularly funny comic team .  the little inside jokes and digs at other entertainment and particularly at kevin smith films are the best features of the film .  sadly for me they were just not funny enough to make the film worth watching .  this feels like the high school skit that that the principal would not let the kids do on talent night .   ( and it turns out he had very good reasons . )   , low 0 ( -4 to +4 )  a film needs a plot .  it needs characters for empathy value .  it needs a story and an emotional center .  if a film is just a chain of jokes it can only be so good and any entertainment value will succeed or fail based on how funny the jokes are .  kevin smith has now made two satisfying films , clerks and chasing amy .  with dogma he tried to make a philosophical religious comedy and mixed with a madcap romp .  peter cook and dudley moore did that very successfully with their bedazzled .  but getting the combination to work is very hard to do right and kevin smith's fecal monsters in dogma were not the way to do it .  his remaining two films , mallrats and his new jay and silent bob strike back are aimed squarely at a teenage audience .  jay and silent bob strike back is a compendium of gay jokes , penis jokes , flatulence jokes , film pastiches , and in-jokes .  how funny the jokes are will be a subjective call .  for me , the vast majority of the jokes were just not very funny .  there was not enough cleverness or variety .  it is funny at most once or twice to accuse someone of being gay .  penis jokes work only so many times .  showing up as minor characters in every kevin smith film jay and silent bob were a clever pair of human running gags .  they were sort of the modern equivalents of naunton wayne and basil radford , the comic duo who showed up satirizing the english middle class in several good british post-war films including dead of night , the lady vanishes , and passport to pimlico .  jay and silent bob were originally supposedly typical generation x stoners .  as the series wore on they had larger and larger parts .  in jay and silent bob strike back they are the leads .  jay and silent bob ( played by jason mewes and kevin smith ) are chased away from the front of the convenience store where they were dealing drugs in clerks .  this leaves them at loose ends .  they are not sure what would be worthwhile to do with their lives when they hear that a comic book with characters visually modeled on them will be adapted into a movie .  they decide to devote their lives to wrecking the movie or getting some of that big movie industry cash .  so it is off to hollywood to shake down the movie company and having adventures along the way .  the film is mostly about their adventures on the road and when they get to hollywood  the problem with this comedy team is that neither really pulls his weight to make the film funny .  silent bob , being silent , can only contribute to the comedy by reacting with that very expressive face of his .  this makes his piece of the comedy even less than a straight man like a dean martin or bud abbott would have .  jay has to be the comic .  he could carry the load for both if he were extremely inventive .  the problem is that he is not sufficiently funny .  he is too bland to be the comic half and his lines just do not show any comic flair .  so jay and silent bob are a long way from being a successful comic team .  their starring roles and the low humor make this a comedy for those young at mind and for people who can laugh at gags they have seen before--sometimes just minutes before .  like dogma before it , but definitely not like chasing amy , this film feels more like an amateurish skit than a real movie .  certainly neither the plot nor the characters are at all involving .  they are excuses for gags , many of which still fall flat .  it is dogma without any of the humorous theological content .  the film does not offer much to an adult audience .  i rate it 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  |-0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|"The overall sentiment from the explanations is that the reviewer has a negative opinion of the movie ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" because they find the plot weak, jokes sporadically funny, lack of character development, and that it feels like an amateurish skit rather than a real movie."

acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video .  it is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house .  but no one has arrived yet .  her 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups .  some of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers .  but they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end .  those who are invited are the ones that have the issues .  it is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms .  first there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof .  he is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production .  bridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them .  they stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections .  he is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school .  his lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch .  as bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy .  moving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts .  val is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene .  on the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find .  paradoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds .  of all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot .  wisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless .  paul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship .  however , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening .  finally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film .  jack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before .  while she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy .  very often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory .  however , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted .  instead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies .  first , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot .  at other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot .  there are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish .  not in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver .  and yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots .  perhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end .  but it didn't happen that way .  the cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight .  |-0.593|0.85|0.85|"The
