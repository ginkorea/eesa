0|"this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation .  but lo and behold , here comes "" switchback , "" and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as "" kiss the girls "" and "" i know what you did last summer . ""  but "" switchback "" is an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting .   "" switchback "" opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she's watching .  we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while .  he is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn't keep him from offering pursuit .  lacrosse's most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r . lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man .  in a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado .  along the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto ) .  this tangent isn't a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself .  or is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about .  in a sense , that's half of the basic problem with "" switchback . ""  for its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we're given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we'll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction .  but "" switchback "" then decides to explicitly reveal the killer's identity at its midpoint , and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense .  some of the acting is a burdensome area as well , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves .  what is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ?  and dennis quaid ?   ( that monotone -- stop it ! )  ermey is solid in a supporting role that's more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes' object of affection in "" my so-called life "" ) is a scene-stealer tried and true .  >from a material standpoint , "" switchback "" is pretty empty .  but even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote "" the fugitive "" and "" die hard "" ) doesn't know what to do , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals .  the set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor .  still , that's not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond , and more than the movie's look will end up leaving you cold .

0|"some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others , almost as gifted , have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable .  as was amply evident after basic instinct , sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon .  rejecting her natural abilities , she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type .  gloria is her latest disaster .  babe ruth didn't quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity , and neither should stone reject what she does best .  janeane garofalo , for example , is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone's part in basic instinct ; neither is stone any less talented because she couldn't do garofalo's comedic roles .  gloria , directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes , was not screened in advance for critics , almost always a sign that the studio isn't behind the picture .  after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened , it is clear why they held it from the press .  it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed .  as the story opens , an angry gloria ( stone ) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement .  she's got a bad attitude and a big mouth .  she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents , a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast .  an annoying child actor named jean-luke figueroa plays a soon-to-be orphan named nicky .  just before his whole family is gunned down by hoods working for gloria's ex-boyfriend kevin ( jeremy northam ) , nicky's dad gives him a banana yellow floppy disk with secrets about kevin's operation and offers him a piece of fatherly advice .

0|"susan granger's review of "" ghosts of mars "" ( sony pictures entertainment )  horror auteur john carpenter ( "" halloween , "" "" vampires "" ) strikes out with this sci-fi eco-fable that's so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green-lit .  the script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year's "" pitch black , "" involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood-thirsty , marauding aliens .  in the year 2176 , there are 640 , 000 earthlings on mars , living in a matriarchal society led by a commander , played by pam grier .  grier , pill-poppin' natasha henstridge , and some rookie mars police officers ( clea duvall , jason statham ) travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch "" desolation "" williams - that's ice cube - to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder .  but when they're besieged by demented , zombie-like , body-snatching miners , they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection .  it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and , soon after , most of the miners went bonkers as long-dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies , lopping off heads as "" vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet , "" according to a scientist ( joanna cassidy ) .  carpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the "" night of the living dead "" -like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing .  but you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed , along with the order of their elimination .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" ghosts of mars "" thuds to a laborious , bottom-of-the-barrel 1 .  perhaps , indeed , there is a curse on mars films , if you recall two other duds : "" mission to mars "" and "" red planet .

0|"i never understood what the clich ? "" hell on earth "" truly meant until very recently .  i've just never experienced anything in my life which was so terrifying , so horrible , so monstrously deplorable that it justified being termed as "" hell on earth "" .  after all , i've never been to war , i've never been the victim of any violent crime , i've never really been broken hearted , and i've never been audited ; so i really had no frame of reference as to people meant when they said that something was "" hell on earth ""  then i saw cruel intentions .  in a perfect world , i would be in charge of all the movie studios .  the very first thing i'd do in this perfect world , would be to take every hollywood producer who thinks that setting any story in contemporary america with a 20-something cast playing teenagers and featuring a soundtrack ripped directly from mtv , and throw them in jail .  but it wouldn't just be your average jail , not even a maximum security installation .  i'd have these producers ( and everyone else involved in the production of these films ) put in front of a war crimes tribunal and forced to beg for mercy for their crimes against humanity .  now you're probably thinking to yourself : "" is this really how bad cruel intentions is ?

0|"about an hour or so into "" the jackal , "" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out "" i hope she gets killed now ! ""  at that point it hit me : i didn't care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn't really like .  when the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he's being played by sidney poitier , you know something's rotten in the state of denmark .  every year , a couple films like this are released .  you know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago .  this was the third one of '97 , following the very lackluster "" the saint , "" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun "" the peacemaker , "" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain .   "" the jackal "" tries to mix both elements .  and you thought "" the saint "" was bad .   "" the jackal "" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i've yet to see , "" the day of the jackal , "" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule .  well , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or  is he ?  after being hired by a russian mob lord as a bit of vengeance for the murder of his brother ( killed in the opening scenes ) , the jackal romps all over the northen hemisphere , from helsinki to virginia , setting up an elaborate scheme wherein he'll be able to assasinate this person and still get away to live in seclusion .  and like the saint , the jackal changes his look over and over and over again to elude people .  the agent working on the case , cater preston ( sidney poitier - yes , that sidney poitier ) , working with a russian agent , valentina koslova ( diane venora - lady capulet from "" romeo + juliet "" ) , gives up early on and meets with an ex-ira man , declan mulqueen ( richard gere , putting up some tight competition between himself and brad pitt for worst fake irish accent of '97 ) who's in a massachusetts jail , but who has apparently seen the jackal , who has been eluding the law forever .  soon , he's out working with the two untrusting agents , and trying to help them catch him .  there are numerous problems with the film , and which one is the biggest one is pretty impossible to put a finger on .  the film is supposed to be a big suspense thriller , but save a couple moments , the film never achieves suspense , or even a sense of intrigue .  sure , the big assasination attempt is a bit cool looking and even slightly tense , but every other scene in the film is too short and too dull to register .  the film never picks up enough to become a thrilling experience , or even an entertaining one .  it doesn't help that the plot is designed to be complex , but falls into so many problems , like plot holes and unbelievable circumstances .  the script of "" the jackal "" is a complete mess , mostly because it can't decide what it wants to focus on .  is this a film about a man trying to find redemption by catching a nasty killer ?  is it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who's in everything for the money ?  or is it a combination of both ?   "" the jackal "" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character .  the connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast .  the worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then .  the supporting characters are worse .  sidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable .  what is poitier doing here ?  he's one of the best living actors !  does he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ?  diane venora's russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade .  it's not that anyone's bad here ; it's that they have nothing to do .  the plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time .  the jackal himself is not even much of an international villain .  there are several times where he's in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill .  take a scene where he's being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it .  doesn't killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ?  and does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ?  geez !  is there anything good here ?  well . . . a  couple things .  i did like willis's icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle .  richard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have .  and a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis .  but none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they're just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is "" the jackal . ""  director michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior "" rob roy "" ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way .  every now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( "" clear and present danger , "" which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but "" the jackal "" is an example of when they go completely wrong .

0|"what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project .  most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films .  john frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60's , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin .  screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd .  ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes .  even charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn't act , did a decent job in cider house rules .  when all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining .  after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration .  the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining .  the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are .  it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights .  we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar .  the actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun .  reindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don't seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn't look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest .  evidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled "" boy this movie is horrible ! ""  and when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments .  the story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) .  nick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person .  when nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays .  unfortunately ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship .  thinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard .  now rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel .  confused ?  the movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax .  but reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour .  the hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley .  some hero .  the point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire .  when rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times .  the most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason .  the routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead .  the only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food .  why he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me .  why any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me .

0| ( dreamworks skg ) running time : 2 hours starring robert duvall , tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair .  elijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth .  tea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth .  also featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny's father and mother .  while many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one .  the main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all .  only the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters .  and because i couldn't care for them , i didn't really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not .  the script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements .  mimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in a ho-hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame .  the cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good .  she seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist .  robert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money .  elijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is surprisingly average , although his choice of roles lately haven't exactly been brilliant ( i . e .  flipper , 1996 ) .  his role is also vastly underwritten .  morgan freeman , again , is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role .  like duvall , he just seems to be in the film for the money .  the supporting cast are all o . k , none making much of an impression .  ok , so deep impact may have messed up character wise , but surely the special effects are good ?  well , yes and no .  although the special effects should be impressive , with a massive tidal wave destroying new york , the special effects look like , well , special effects .  sadly , the waves looks like it's been drawn on computer , and doesn't look too good at all .  surprising really , when the effects are done by industrial light & magic , who did the effects for the lost world and twister .  in the end , deep impact is a wasted opportunity .  what could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects .  the 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect .  once again , dreamworks has churned out another average movie .  let's hope armageddon is a bit better .  overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities  |-0.5499999999999999|0.85|0.8833333333333333|The review expresses a negative sentiment towards the film, citing dull characters, a simple and underwritten script, and unimpressive special effects as reasons for disappointment.
0|"seen may 2 , 1998 at 3 : 40 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 , theater #13 , with chris wessell and sean o'shea for $5 .  [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats]  the big-budget , mega-hype "" event "" movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one .  gluttony is hollywood's favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis .   "" lost in space "" is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre .  it's made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for .  audiences' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has "" star wars "" written all over it ) , but as the producers' way of showing off their budget through the special effects .  battle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it's impossible to care about anything that happens .  in essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking .  we meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth's behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources .  each member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people .  professor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it's obvious what role this aspect will play ) .  of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are "" resolved "" at the right moments .  the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it's presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it's laughable .  the first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! ) .  we're provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent .  in fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent .  yes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk .  they say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it's the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) .  it's amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens .  eventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not .  the story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage .  what ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts .  the first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as "" alien "" -lite .  the story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive .  but there's never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly .  plotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario .  the atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it's presented in such a ridiculous way it's utterly boring .  by the time the last act rolls around , there is no sense of a payoff building .  the ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) .   "" lost in space "" is major film production at its worst .  it's frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment .

0|"the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could've been effective .  such is the case with _urban legend_ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks .  the idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends .  examples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house .  the killer wears one of those l . l . bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up , so you can't see the face .  i guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days .  anyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric .  it's a very good setup that promises more chills to come .  unfortunately , the film never takes off from there .  the movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus .  like most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac ( or in this case an axe wielding maniac ) .  i've always wondered why these killers don't save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill .  after the fine first scene , the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just- someone-else scares .  these are always accompanied by loud bursts of music .  i guess sudden , sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days .  the actual killer will attack at about every third music blast .  the slasher appears , attacks , the victim is eviscerated , and the tedious cycle appears anew .  false scares should always be used in moderation .  someone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren't as scary as they used to be .  this movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit--it's not frightening .  remember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ ?  this movie still adheres to them .  tons of illogical moments about ; more than i really have the inclination to list .  and i don't mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense .  that type of illogical can be fun .  this film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember .  the last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you'll be laughing more than you'll be screaming .  actually , you won't be screaming at all .  at its best , the acting can barely be called "" adequate "" and the script could've definitely used a rewrite or two .  the film still manages to have some strong points .  the killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans .  there are some intentionally funny moments .   ( these were exceeded by the unintentional ones . )  the film is well made from a technical standpoint .  besides the first part , there is also another good scene , a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station .  if there had only been more sequences like this , that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music , _urban legend_ might've been worth your money .

0|"my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love .  i love ralph fiennes .  i love uma thurman .  i love sean connery .  hell , i'm even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw .  i saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i've been eagerly awaiting the film ever since .  a few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground .  then , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics .  and that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs .  and that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique .  my expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things .  the film i saw today didn't even meet those expectations .  this is a lousy , incoherent mess .  i would slam it harder , if it weren't for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors .  but sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired .  that's the main problem with the avengers : for all it's hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired .  it's like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making .  it also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots .  this is just plain depressing .  the avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show .  frequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i've never watched an episode .  i wasn't alive then .  i don't even watch television now .  i'm very sorry that i don't have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i've already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse .  i didn't know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles .  i also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film .  based on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits .  they are to work together , under mother's orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) .  it seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather .  his name is de wynter ( connery ) .  he is a crazy scottish guy .  our heroes had better stop him , or else .   .   .  the weather will keep getting colder until they "" have to go to hell to warm up "" ( one of the film's few funny lines ) .  along the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense .  for example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos .  now , killer bugs don't really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film .  the purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established .  they're never even directly connected to de wynter ( they're controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) .  the special effects aren't bad , but they're loud , obnoxious , and intrusive .  like so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning .  and i guarantee you , it will wane .  i stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn't do any good to think .  the avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn't tell us what happens .  there are several scenes in the preview that didn't make the final cut .  in addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) .  the scenes that don't feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast .  they aren't .  the action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film .  they aren't , either .  and what about this wasted cast ?  oh , it makes me weep with disappointment .  we're talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * .  i love the guy .  i've loved all his films , until this one .  he seems like he wants to understand the film , but he's as lost as we are .  and thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can't manage to look at home here .   ( i don't blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can't be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . )  connery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter .  who is to blame ?  is it the screenwriter , don macpherson ?  perhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right .  is it the actors ?  for god's sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling .  i blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn't have been given the task to begin with .  his best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor .  add to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory .  if the avengers has a saving grace , it's the set design .  the sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at .  i like the final set-piece , on de wynter's island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense .  i admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere .  i also enjoyed michael kamen's music score , particularly in the opening credits .  but this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there's a lot more that needs to be here .  inspiration , for instance , would have been really nice .  maybe a little bit of cohesion in the story .  or a sense of purpose .  most of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles .  damn this movie for not giving them the chance .

( personal side note : i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip .  for whatever reason , my hotel's cable system wasn't showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup .  this forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective . )  snake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater .  snake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where's the manager , and how do i get a re-admit pass ?  if i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent-a-car , can i sue brian de palma ?  is it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage's oscar ?  will someone please ( i'm begging you ) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents ?  and how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ?  the first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer .  if you've seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate .  the trailer is a work of sheer genius .  it manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage's performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot .  the expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross .   ( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? )  but all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie .  the trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match .  unfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot .  the trailer gives away much , too much of the story .  the shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy .  the film's secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is .  without an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level .  as much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit .  de palma is maddeningly inconsistent .  he can , on his day , create amazingly well-done movies ( the untouchables , carlito's way ) .  on off-days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain ) .  snake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school degree-of-difficulty value .  the steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor .  there is a split-screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it's followed by a god's eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that's imaginitively done .  this is what's called giving the devil his due .  but the technical skill doesn't even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie .  placing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years .  snake eyes is a criminal act , an evil waste of time and talent .  cage , sinise , and yes , even de palma deserve better .  the audience deserves better -- but no refund , no re-admit pass , no free popcorn coupon , can ever restore to us the time we've spent or wash the awful images from our mind .  however , we are left with one consolation , that we were warned by the movie's title -- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps .  |-0.7833333333333333|0.9166666666666666|0.8666666666666666|"The overall sentiment is very negative, with the text expressing disappointment, frustration, and criticism towards the movie ""Snake Eyes.""

"" batman forever "" was fun .  this is a big bore of over-produced action sequences and shallow characters .  i mean , this one bit .  i'm gonna put all the plot in one paragraph : mr . freeze ( ah-nold ) , who's wife was dying of some disease , has become the new big villain these days .  he's a huge ex-scientist who fell into some weird liquid ( hello ?  joker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body .  batman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they're growing apart .  meanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he's used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had .  she emerges from her chemicals ( don't ask 'cause i can't tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who's poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people .  she starts to tear away at the dynamic duo .  meanwhile , alfred's dying of the same disease mr . freeze's wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl .  meanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman's alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing .  end of her for all we know .  mr . freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don't ask ! ! ! ) .  the trio must team together "" as family "" to beat them .  there ya go .  not the whole story but no big context clues .  too much , right ?  right !  the films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels .  however , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one .  he gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that's it .  maybe some stunts .  for all this , i can't even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy !  and when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say .  i think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode .  george is in between them .  he's not quintessential , he's not horrible , he's good .  but i'm sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they'll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we'll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) .  the villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher .  last time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey .  this time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze .  we feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ?  arnold isn't very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points .  when he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber .  wow .  but uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness .  it's like she's almost parodying herself in "" pulp fiction "" at points .  she's incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better .  as for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in "" batman forever , "" although i think his work in these is too hokey when he's best at quieter parts in "" scent of a woman "" or just plain cool parts in "" fried green tomotoes .

""  fortunately , we get a lot of alfred .  he's the always reliable butler , in case you didn't know , who has been with bruce all his life .  he's a god .  he's a father figure .  he's also dying .  this got to me .  i love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me .  we also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . . . but  this is never answered , as this film is too cluttered .  but in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma .  for one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do .  and there are some nice touches .  when they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient's belongings in a room and we see the riddler's costume .  i laughed .  and during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as "" droogs "" from "" a clockwork orange . ""  i laughed at all these .  the film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or  did it just feel like that ?  the film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays .  people are fed up with stupid films .  that's why the word of mouth killed "" the lost world ! ""  that's why last year , indy films grossed more than ever .  that's why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it .  that's why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo's "" face/off "" and barry sonnenfeld's "" men in black , "" both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on .  i like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste .  i like some of his films ( "" flatliners , "" "" a time to kill "" ) but a lot of them suck .  he's a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that's what makes him great .  but his costuming for woody allen's "" sleeper "" was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) .  i love the "" batman "" series .  the first two rocked and i did like the last one .  but this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three .  hopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time .  and maybe they'll get smart and bring back catwoman .  and michael keaton .  but we can only hope .

0|"writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer )  starring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso  i suppose i'm not extremely surprised that "" virus "" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it's an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron's early works .  in fact , "" virus "" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the "" aliens "" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future .  no such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron's wing for years and years , i'm beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him .  in fact , "" virus "" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like "" virus "" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget .  the film seems to not only borrow it's plot from last year's similarly-fated "" deep rising , "" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the '80s called "" leviathan , "" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part "" alien , "" part john carpenter's twisted remake of "" the thing . ""   "" virus , "" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water .  they get on .  they break up into pairs and investigate .  and they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) .  not that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters .  of its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper .  and it's not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even "" aliens "" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don't give a damn .  i almost don't even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he's a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed .  like anthony hopkins for "" legends of the fall "" ( the line "" scrooooooo 'em "" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) .  or peter o'toole in "" caligula . ""  great actor , horrific performance .  it happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland's career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film .  though it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone's still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it's laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them .   "" virus "" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , "" if it's dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . ""  and if you don't believe me , go back and rent "" godzilla , "" and tell me if there's even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don't really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) .  but all of this doesn't matter since "" virus "" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie .  the action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i've ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn't figure it out when i saw it ) .  imagine the first attack of the aliens in "" aliens , "" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that's basically the whole of "" virus "" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members .  and my god , it's a long damn sit .  with no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it's a wonder that it even got made .  we already know that big movie studios' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like "" out of sight "" and "" saving private ryan "" give you more faith in them , but movies like "" virus "" manage to drain a little more out of the pool .  i almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light .  they read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face .  even though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i'd say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad .  in fact , shouts of "" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ?

0|"this is your definitive "" hollywood "" movie , extremely predictable , following the basic formula ( a horrible ending ) , overzealous writing ( meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting , therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space ) and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise-ass character ( of which we've seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly , wasn't used enough here ) , i'm afraid the film would have been completely unbearable .  in this film , ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend .  while in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her .  over money ( how original ) .  while in jail she works out , exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition .  now she has learned about a law titled "" double jeopardy "" stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her ( although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works ) .  now her po ( parole officer ) , and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims .  skipping over to the acting : the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress ( no offense , she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times , in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better . . .  but she's terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying ) doesn't really add to the movie at all ; just takes away .  as i'd said , jones was fine , although he did not have much to work with .  he was much more of a supporting character .  which is fine , and he handled it well ; especially considering the material he had to work with .  i feel this film had alot going for it .  originality not being an issue .  the acting was the only thing ( as i said ) keeping it alive .  the plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better .  the action scenes were well made ( however sometimes out of place ) .  i was just left unsatisfied in the long run .  so basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over-thought , the plot has certainly been done before ( generally speaking ) , the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot , and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones , who if he had some more screentime , could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating ; in my book , anyway .  keep this in mind , if you're in the mood for a good action film -- rent the fugitive .  d+  "|-0.7833333333333333|0.85|0.87|"The overall sentiment is negative, as the movie is criticized for its predictability, overzealous writing, unconvincing acting, and unsatisfying plot.

0|"dead-bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it .  although dead-bang is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one "" dead bore . ""  in the film , johnson plays . . .  you guessed it . . .  a cop .  the role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on "" miami vice . ""  a la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life .  beck's wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children .  she will not even allow him to wish them "" merry christmas "" by telephone .  but beck's family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang .  beck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop .  his investigation starts in l . a . and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp .  virtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective .  the plot is incoherent and full of holes .  the movie depicts beck's investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions .  the action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense .  i certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii .  in all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang's shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction .  dead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting .  according to the movie's production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck .  you would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable .  most of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above .  william forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who's offended by beck's foul language and unorthodox methods .  forsythe's lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable .  dead-bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( "" wkrp in cincinnati "" and "" frank's place "" ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains .  the sole function of penelope ann miller's character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less .  i guess the film's title refers to this love scene since it's definitely a dead bang .  the only real virtue of dead-bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie's pitiful script .  johnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life .  and i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments .  the funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him .  but when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie's in trouble .  the other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can't keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen .  but two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make .

0|it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels , you must suspend disbelief .   however , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies .  it came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald's , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by .  even if you can ignore these somewhat white lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just dont gel .  firstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement .  he _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman .  as a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases .  i say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started .  but nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van .  with a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesnt take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road .  jim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars .  but of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town .  the local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars .  director mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite goodies versus baddies ,  there are numerous twists in its plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience .  but by the time these interesting changes occur , its far too late in the film for them to have much affect .  hard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par .  not at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected .  such titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations .  strangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta .  we can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character .  if you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no .  i now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you dont believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) .  although hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen .  the addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that cant handle anything else .  despite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film .  no creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesnt really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 . 50 is compare this to other films .  |-0.3333333333333333|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|"The overall sentiment towards the movie ""Hard Rain"" is negative, with the author expressing disappointment in various aspects such as the plot, performances, and lack of originality."

( furthermore , would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? )  both actresses fare better than neeson , who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason ) , and his character is the most bland .  as luke puts it , dr . marrow pulls the old "" academic bait and switch "" on his subjects , but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he's accused .  later , he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it's amusing to hear neeson shout "" nell "" repeatedly , given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name ) .  why was this nice , helpful , and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ?  the haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti .  his sets are obsessively detailed , and even before the cgi kicks in , they seem alive , never quite still .  i do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots , nottinghamshire's harlaxton manor , is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house .  eighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically .  thank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke , in that it was actually enjoyable , de bont has served up another ride , sans thrill .  his images , well-lit though they are , have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact , whole sequences , not to mention the cloaked , airy ghoul who owns the climax , feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back , peter jackson's the frighteners .  i don't mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist , i mean to suggest that he's a hack , having found no new ways to give us chills .

0|"play it to the bone is a punch-drunk mess of a movie .  containing a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men can't jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two .  rocky no . 1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word . . .  something that he has not yet successfully achieved .  rocky no . 2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince's ex-girlfriend , grace .  both men are nearing the end of their "" almost "" careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity .  when both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement .  our boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is "" promised "" a shot at a future title fight .  the film is divided into two sections .  at first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace's "" sassy grassy "" green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day .  along the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by .  once in vegas , the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar .  both mr . harrelson and mr . banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past , not that we'd know it from their work here .  mr . harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince .  the christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable .  mr . banderas is uncharacteristically non-charismatic as caesar .  weak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance .  the other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another .  tom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy liu ( payback ) is a sex-starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who can't make her mind up which boxer she prefers .  because of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins .  but even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other .  writer/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well-choreographed , well-edited , and well-performed .  if only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film .  as it is , the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable .  the title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film .  the phrase , "" play it to the bone' is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you've achieved your desired goal .  that is a biblical principle .   "" know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ?  so run , that ye may obtain .

0|"i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie .  using their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget .  this is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) .  now , before i continue to ferociously attack what's wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller .  catherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) .  if you've ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don't have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes .  the problem we come to is that we've all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn't break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre .  the result is that the entire production feels contrived .  i'm going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones .  now while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn't for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are .  just about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between "" entrapment "" and "" blackmail "" .  with an eighty million dollar budget , you'd think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x .  well , you'd be wrong .  the action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular .  unfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years .  the reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what's going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists .  many scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing .  one particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask .  nothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn't she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ?  i'll tell you why : because it's a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) .  ving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) .  one last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he'll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion .  i can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself "" it'll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? ""  we know jon , it's called editing .

0|"when i originally saw the trailer for "" analyze this "" a few months ago , i must admit , i thought it looked kind of lame .  and then when the commercials started popping up a week or two ago , i thought it looked outright bad .  but then when "" analyze this "" finally opened a few days ago , an odd thing happened .  it got great reviews .  critics were proclaiming it "" hilarious "" and a "" dead-on parody of mob movies "" .  well , with praise like that , i figured , it must be good and so i headed off to the theater .  you know that expression that says always trust your gut instincts ?  well , turns out that expression is more valid than i ever gave it credit for .   "" analyze this "" is slow , unfunny , and badly acted .  don't get me wrong , i think that deniro is one of the top ten greatest actors of the century , but he is just out of his league here .  i think the problem is he didn't quite know how to approach this material .  he plays his character , mob boss paull vitti , somewhere in between the realm of comedy and drama .  if he had played the character straight , along the lines of leslie nielson in the "" naked gun "" series , he probably would have been a lot more successful .  as it is , though , he plays the character completely serious at some moments , and for laughs at others .  this doesn't work .  it creates an uneven character that never breaks out of the deniro mold ; you always know it's him .  and the movie is badly paced , too .  it never takes off .  it just crawls from one scene to another without any forward momentum .  i think the blame for this should be placed on the script .  it's obvious the writer had a good idea for a movie , mob boss faces breakdown and needs the services of a psychiatrist , but once this is established , the movie doesn't really go anywhere .  the formula of the film seems to be this : billy crystal says no to deniro , deniro forces him , and much wackiness ensues .  this formula of sorts is repeated several times throughout the movie .  i've said it before and i'll say it again : the only thing that matters to me in a comedy is whether or not it's funny .  if "" analyze this "" had been funny , the pacing and bad acting wouldn't have bothered me .  i would have been too busy laughing to notice .  but as it is , i only chuckled a few times .  the only really funny scene is a dead-on parody of "" the godfather "" .  sadly , though , i don't think anyone in the audience i saw it with realized it was a parody , because i was the only one laughing .  but my sense of humour , i have come to realize , is vastly different from the general population .  i loathed "" there's something about mary "" , yet loved "" baseketball "" .  now , if you want a movie that * i * think is funny , go out and see "" office space "" .  it's full of genuine laughs and won't leave you glancing at your watch every 10 minutes , as "" analyze this "" did .
