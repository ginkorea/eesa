1|"in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy's jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year's smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system .  apparently , it was just lying dormant .  with ivan reitman's enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons .  ford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island .  of course , the sophisticated robin and the salt-of-the-earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting .  while some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche .  both actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon .  naturally , there's nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin's warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates .  granted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked-on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes .  but the point is to get the two together , and their newfound affection causes complications for both , but mostly robin , who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank ( david schwimmer ) , who frantically awaits her return on the home island .  reitman , and old , reliable hand at breezy comedies , keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences .  his big accomplishment , however , is bringing the old , smiling ford back .  as appealing and charismatic as he always is , ford hasn't been quite this charming and affable in years ; he's obviously having a blast , and the audience cannot help but have one along with him .  holding her own is heche , whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be ( as the plane goes down , she frantically pops stress pills ) .  she can take her lumps , physical and otherwise , just as well as quinn , making her a formidable foil and ideal match .  formulaic and light as a feather , _six_days , _seven_nights_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer "" popcorn "" movie season's lack of substance .  it's certainly fluff , but it's unpretentious , undemanding , and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach .  pass the popcorn .

1|near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king .  the following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia .  at best , that's all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry .  in 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different .  there have been a number of pushes on disney's death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into '98 , a new champion has emerged .  dreamworks' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed .  the other two contenders , warner brothers' quest for camelot and disney's own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively .  although camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can't really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner .  unfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition .  in making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product .  the animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug's life , is the best-looking movie to date .  the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with .  the key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot .  namely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d .  dreamworks is the first studio to prove that they've got the stuff of success , and that they're capable of challenging disney .  the story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent .  for the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense .  the writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way .  in fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything .  moses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) 's palace and is taken in by the royal family .  moses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves .  by this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention .  the cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin .  the script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting .  it's decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven't had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost .  but for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch .  |0.0|0.8333333333333334|0.7333333333333334|"The sentiment of the text is generally positive, as it discusses how Dreamworks' ""The Prince of Egypt"" successfully challenged Disney's animation dominance.

1|"capsule : a rock and roll fable , indeed .  like a hubert selby , jr . novel filtered through equal parts damon runyan and bruce springsteen , and a ton of fun .  streets of fire bills itself as "" a rock and roll fable "" , and the description is perfect .  this is a stylish , great-looking , and breezily enjoyable movie that feels like a hubert selby , jr . , novel with a damon runyan rewrite , irected by bruce springsteen .  noir is one of the few truly american movie genres , aside from the hollywood musical and the western .  this is post-wwii brooklyn noir , for lack of a better label , with a generous injection of rock 'n roll and an all-around confrontational attitude .  it all works .  the plot is simplicity itself : rocker ellen aim ( diane lane ) is kidnapped by a vicious street gang , led by a bloodthirsty fellow named raven ( willem dafoe , very nasty ) .  her old soldier flame ( played by michael pare ) comes back into town to save her , but doesn't count on a whole bunch of things going askew .  that's about the entire plot , save for the spats with ellen's manager ( a hilarious rick moranis ) , an encounter with a doo-wop group that winds up becoming ellen's supporting act , and a whole gang of other fun little touches .  but in movies like this , when is the plot important ?  the movie is all style , all visuals and attitudes , quotable lines and posturing -- and it delivers all those things consistently and with great brio and pacing .  no surprise that it was directed by walter hill ( 48 hrs . ) , who understands this kind of macho romanticism perfectly , and has put together a movie that's a mixture of times and sensibilities , but perfectly unified in tone .  when was the last time you could say something like that about a movie , especially a movie where it seems like someone gets decked on the jaw ( * and * passes out ) every 2 . 63 minutes on cue ?  streets of fire isn't the greatest movie ever made , but it occupies a totally unique little niche , and enjoys the position it has .  anyone with a weakness for doo-wop , neon , motorcycles , rainy streets , the el , studebakers , gang pictures , lonely heroes , and a great-looking gal giving the microphone both lungs will eat this movie up .  i did .

1|jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway .  in as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where .  he's mean .  i mean really mean .  the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium .  every day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress .  you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe .  one day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks .  at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too .  another person who often crosses melvin's sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin's floor .  aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target .  simon's friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better .  when simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon's dog while he convalesces .  this is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage .  an interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin's softening up to the world around him .  it doesn't happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love .  one of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others .  he's traveling terra incognita here , and it shows .  good performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt .  they play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen .  greg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon .  he gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels .  cuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance .  the screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny .  the best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting .  melvin is a man we can't quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention .  carol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem .  simon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society .  combined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film .  the one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half .  his character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved .  i would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film's conclusion .  there's one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie's best scenes and who deserves mention .  this is that little dog .  he plays such a pivotal role to melvin's character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal .  award or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you've got an outstanding movie .  |0.3666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.9|"The text provides a positive evaluation of the movie ""As Good as It Gets,"" highlighting the development of characters, positive performances, engaging screenplay, and likability of the characters, while noting a minor lacking aspect in the second half."

1|the deer hunter , directed by michael cimino , is truly one of the greatest movies ever made .  a captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian-american pennsylvania community , the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget .  in this academy award winner for best picture of 1978 , outstanding performances are turned in by all actors , and cimino's brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character's lives .  the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together .  michael , portrayed perfectly by robert de niro , is shown early on as the natural leader of the group .  after a days work , the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar , where john ( george dzundza ) works .  three of the men , michael , steven ( john savage ) , and nick ( christopher walken ) will be leaving shortly for vietnam , but not before steven gets married .  after the marriage , the group , including axel ( chuck aspegren ) , spend one last day on a hunting trip , one of their favorite past-times .  this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men , who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war .  the wedding scenes , although criticized by many as being quite long , actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act .  the outstanding performances by de niro , walken , streep , savage , and cazale , who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed , really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future .  the second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam , stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong .  the men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river .  this prison , run by the v . c . ,  initiates the horrifying scenes in the movie , where the prisoners are forced to play russian roulette against each other .  steven , who is emotionally marred by this turn of events , is secluded in a tiger cage with water up to his face when he refuses to participate .  michael shows his leadership again by convincing nick that the only way that steven will survive is if the two friends play against each other , and moreover , they must play with 3 bullets in the gun .  personally , i felt that de niro's absolutely gripping portrayal really was displayed in a brilliant way in these and the following scenes .  the men are eventually able to escape , but are separated .  michael is able to get steven , who ends up losing his legs , to medical care , while nick finds his way to saigon and a u . s . army hospital .  michael returns home and does not feel at all like a hero .  he wants to avoid the celebrations and recognition that his friends would like to bestow upon him .  he assumes that nick is still lost in vietnam .  the third act concentrates more on walken's character , who eventually stumbles upon a small gambling operation where the game is , again , russian roulette .  only in this game , you play for money .  michael has learned that nick is possibly still alive and returns to saigon to attempt to find him .  the two narrowly find each other at the russian roulette games , but do not link up until michael discovers nick participating in the games and tries to bring him home .  a very emotional , and , for many , a very disturbing movie , the deer hunter is a truly magnificent movie that should not be missed .  the greatest performances possible are turned in by all actors , and cimino's directing , which is considered to be at his all-time best in this film , is equally dazzling .  do not miss this film , it will captivate and astound you .  |0.85|0.9|0.8000000000000002|"The text is highly positive, praising ""The Deer Hunter"" as one of the greatest movies ever made, applauding the exceptional performances by the actors and the brilliant directing by Michael Cimino, with a special emphasis on the emotional and disturbing aspects of the film."
1|with storytelling this compelling , who needs books ?  based on the book by author james ellroy , l . a . confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years .  together with director curtis hanson ( the hand that rocks the cradle , the river wild ) whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film , resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight , an atom would have to squeeze itself through .  set in the 50s , the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities .  jack vincennes ( spacey ) is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style , concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention .  there is also the young hot-shot rookie , ed exley ( pearce ) , fresh out of the academy and all-out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father .  the tough and unnerving bud white ( crowe ) , a cop who believes in justice , the swift and violent way .  3 policemen , distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil .  when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation , bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder .  even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case , happenings began to link itself to the murder .  the 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised-crime in hollywood .  the last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects .  in l . a . confidential , you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of `story' going for it .  there is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all .  surprisingly , though spacey did a very convincing job as the street-wise vincennes , the movie was carried mostly by the two rather `unknowns' , pearce and crowe .  pearce's exley is cool and calculative in his actions and there is a slight hint of val kilmer in his appearance .  crowe's bud white is the most impressive of all ; head-strong and temperamental , he should obtain some sort of recognition for his work here .  superb acting . , wonderful storytelling and one of the best climaxing gunfights ever .  easily the best hollywood piece for 1997 .  |0.7999999999999999|0.9|0.85|The sentiment is overwhelmingly positive, as the user expresses admiration for the compelling storytelling, impressive acting, and describes it as one of the best works produced by Hollywood, although there are some neutral statements as well.

1|"with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous "" ellen "" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines .  the birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy .  then along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released .  it's also noticeable that this "" alternative lifestyle "" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort .  while it's a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety .  but the way we're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically .  while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy .  it doesn't poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it's comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been .  the idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia .  if you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life .  it's a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick .  it's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set .  kevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana .  after a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar .  the small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other .  when cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett .  everyone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , "" and he's gay . ""  the town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop .  the thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf .  naturally the questions pour from howard's fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school's principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand .  the frenzy isn't helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and "" entertainment tonight "" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning .  one particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of "" inside entertainment "" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding .  the intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute .  it seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees .  the dominoes begin to tumble as howard's closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay .  it all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren't presented with near-perfection by one of this year's most delightful ensemble casts .  kline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here .  the great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully .  every single actor turns in one of their best performances ever .  dillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they're up to bat .  rudnick's script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you'll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes .  while in & out doesn't carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around .  the script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we're allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs .  it remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we're still allowed a sappily touching ending .  despite it's subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy .  frank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick's script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit .  check this one out .  you'll have a gay old time .

1|with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different .  its structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books .  the parallels don't end there , either .  atlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king's dreamcatcher .  even the film's content is a bit reminiscent of mile .  in fact , it's the perfect blend of the feel-good '60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile .  king's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film's title comes from the second chapter ) .  it's set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould's secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son .  bobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich .  when a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror .  ted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers .  i won't go into what these powers are , but they're considerably toned down from the book ( and don't involve black stuff flying out of ted's mouth , a la mile ) .  atlantis' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel's final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years .  atlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski's red .  the acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter .  most impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider .  while i didn't really have much of a problem with goldman's screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency .  goldman , for those of you who don't read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else's films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he's penned ( like the general's daughter ) .  it's mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . j .  and robert blake ) .  in atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back .  well , he's not , and it doesn't make sense .  1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements  |0.5333333333333333|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive.

1|"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  on december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream .  although the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre .  the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes .  the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost .  scream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line's a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight .  and scream's rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion .  it's hard to understate this last point .  mr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) .  indeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion's share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional "" a film by wes craven "" drapes the film's title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads "" written by kevin williamson "" , an affirmation of the screenwriter's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented .   ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of "" a film by "" is attained . )  and , much like mr . tarantino's screenwriting , mr . williamson's work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters .  in scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels .  scream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson's rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel .  while the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it's only at about the film's midway point when it becomes engaging .  like its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film's principal narrative ; this time around , we're following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the "" true life "" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) .  however , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i've ever seen ) .  there are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn't nearly as cleverly frightening as scream's ; while the first film's preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical .  flash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film .  the murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney .  they're joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded .  the film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn't necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ?  there's a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney's new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy's fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale's newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens' portia di rossi ) .  any of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim .  as is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit .  one problem that scream didn't have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer .  here ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson's screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery .  the film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements .   ( it doesn't help matters any that the killer's alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . )  indeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes .  this is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it .  while the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it's head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences .  they're staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch .  it's hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown .  in terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) .  their verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there's a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed .  on the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here .  she doesn't have any compelling presence , and there's nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she's the returning heroine .  given this , and the fact that there's no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal's role isn't nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan's shoes ) , it's no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film .  what surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast .  the film's mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you've got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel .   ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would've seemed obvious . )  but hey , as rose mcgowan's character said in the first film : "" no , please don't kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! ""  look what that got her .

1|"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  it's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth .  the lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast .  since then , though , disney's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year's hercules successively proving less and less potent .  with the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox's anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid .  while the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music .  the film's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince .  what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions .  from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she's resolutely smitten , and she's such a pure and endearing character that one can't help but invest their heart with her .  this simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture .  one of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters .  this film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities .  while it's understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto's use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia's showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it's unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy .  do we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ?  is the film's entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ?   ( i'm not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . )  fortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast .  chief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film's heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film .   ( she's the only reason i'd even consider catching flubber . )  similarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab .  he easily milks his lovable character's comic moments for all they're worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid's big tunes -- "" under the sea "" and "" kiss the girl "" -- have become the stuff of legend .  pat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel's father , king triton .  in large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast .  of course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman's untimely death .  not only are mr . menken's tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman's charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film's storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character's dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film .  mr . menken's score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken's fine score .  it appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled "" under the sea "" as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson's heartfelt rendition of the ballad "" part of your world "" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film's most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes .  during the song's reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history .  as of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney's limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid .  there's no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film's reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney's dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox's costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia .  in every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film's 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film's opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney's odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away .  but although disney's motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public .  any reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it's a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen .  the little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney's modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made .

1|this christmas , little ralphie parker ( peter billingsley ) wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree .  although cautioned by many that he will ? shoot his eye out' , ralphie remains optimistic , conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers .  it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun , and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one .  `a christmas story' is a favorite among many during the holiday season , and boy , it is certainly easy to see why .  ralphie's endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood , when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable .  evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things `a christmas story' does so well .  here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season :  1 ) period detail .  this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard , who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940's with loving detail .  shepard narrates from a first person point-of-view , divulging his various adventures one snowy december , in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head .  shepard's first-hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious , but also witty and warm , with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing .  on top of that , young billingsley's stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration .  director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality .  i can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like .  2 ) mom and dad .  both melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ? the old man' ) are perfect in their roles .  it's hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one , with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured .  for instance , he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound , and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues .  in portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad , peter billingsley has struck quite the chord .  his performance is richly textured , making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment .  which brings us to . . . .  3 ) the comic situations .  there are plenty of memorable moments in `a christmas story' .  moments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing , with so much more to explore and to cherish .  i am particularly partial of the ? f-word scene' , in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four-letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard .  again , shepard's method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry .  the numerous sequences that stick in one's mind include , of course , the famous department store santa scene - in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree .  i could go on , but i'll finish on this note : `a christmas story' is a standout among holiday movies , because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes .  not only is it funny , it's often genuinely hilarious . . . . not to mention warm , fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places .  i plan on making `a christmas story' a christmas tradition .  why don't you ?  |0.754|0.9|0.8833333333333333|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is highly positive, with praise for the movie ""A Christmas Story"" for its charming, relatable storyline, accurate period detail, excellent performances, and humorous and memorable moments, making it a favorite during the holiday season."
1|"in intolerance , d . w . griffith told four different historical stories at the same time , cutting from one to the other .  each of the stories builds to a fast-paced climax .  in magnolia , paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others .  yet the stories and where they are going are all independent .  what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized .  each story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve .  while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene .  then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again .  it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked .  this creates some strange effects .  the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships .  the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content .  we have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends .  phil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal .  partridge's young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for an unsuspected reason .  frank mackey ( tom cruise ) runs the kinds of self-help seminar that businesses like so much , but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit-heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women's lib .  officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place .  jimmy gator ( philip baker hall ) hosts a popular children's tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h . macy ) .  the film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily .  each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story .  the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories .  the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event .  magnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories .  it is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson's company .  john c . reilly seems to be a standard fixture .  particularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight .  here he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used .  as studies of characters these stories are each worth following .  as well-rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired .  but the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth sitting through .  i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .  heavy spoiler . . .  heavy spoiler . . .  heavy spoiler . . .  heavy spoiler . . .  during the strange climactic event of the film we get multiple messages from the filmmaker that the event we are seeing really does happen .  and in actual fact , it does .  since biblical times rains of frogs have been interpreted as signs of displeasure of the gods .  it is , however , a perfectly natural , if somewhat unnerving , phenomenon .  the cause is associated with whirlwinds .  we know that tornadoes over land can rip up land and even objects of some size from the ground and hurl them into the air , holding them aloft .  the reader may remember the unfortunate cow in twister .  smaller objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are .  when the whirlwind is over water , animals near the surface , frequently fish and frogs , may suffer the same fate .  essentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind , held aloft by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere .  so while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in .  the rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs .  it seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped .  it is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon .   ( frankly i have no idea on these points . )  otherwise the event was quite believable .  what we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano .  in the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 .   "" and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants . ""  however a rain of frogs , though it feels biblical , is most definitely not a biblical portent .  note that the previous verse says "" and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up . . . , ""  so the bible is referring not to a rain but to an infestation from the river .  the only other reference to frogs in the bible is as a symbol for uncleanness in revelation 16 : 13 .

1|"contact is the 1997 movie i've seen the most - five times to be exact .  four of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it's a very impressive film .  the same can't be said for films like independance day , but that's because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn't offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy .  contact's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of "" merely listening "" to sounds out in space .  her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) .  while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive .  ellie's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young .  in puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world's overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as "" a man of the cloth , without the cloth "" .  despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a "" supreme being "" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together .  it's a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on .  meanwhile , dr . david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding .  this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember .  it is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science .  when the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at .  eventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) .  the media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn't get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) .  as if that weren't enough , ellie's discovery leads her to the nation's capital where she again runs into palmer .  contact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion .  the impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias .  arguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking .  when palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests .  the question is , can a person who doesn't believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ?  even when the film wraps up , it's uncertain whether it's meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where "" right and wrong "" is only opinion ( at least speaking "" politically correctly "" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive .  don't get me wrong .  as much as it sounds like it , contact isn't merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film .  it's a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours .  despite its seemingly heavy issues , it's not a tedious undertaking to watch this film .  the special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! )  highly depreciated on the small screen .  even so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as "" sci-fi "" .  the storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it's easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i've ever seen .  this is zemeckis' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast .

1|roberto benigni is a clown in the tradition of chaplin and keaton .  this italian film star , best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther , has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust .  but benigni's life is beautiful ( la vita e bella ) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love , devotion and sacrifice .  the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore .  like many of the slapstick clowns who preceded him , most notably the almost-forgotten harry langdon , benigni's guido has a childlike innocence .  he ignores the growing anti-semitism of the fascist government .  instead , guido ardently falls in love and persues dora , a local school teacher who already is engaged to a local fascist official .  in benigni's tightly wound script this is the same fascist official with whom guido had an earlier unfortunate - yet slapstick - encounter .  guido wins dora .  they marry .  fast forward about five years .  guido , dora , and their 5-year-old son , giosue ? ( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family .  guido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore .  but racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities .  the task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp .  here , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated .  it is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched .  for the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler's list .  true , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor .  unlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust .  his story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child .  for guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game .  giosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points .  the winner takes home a tank .  therefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks .  he cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him .  guido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates .  guido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive .  throughout their imprisonment , guido's quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm's way .  ultimately , the allies rescue the camp .  in a poignant scene , giosue ? comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound .  the boy goes wide-eyed with wonderment and delight , thinking he has won the game .  the price for his victory is most high .  benigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell , a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness .  life is beautiful is a fantasy , a fable .  it is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust .  those who object to it are missing its point .  and that is simply where there is hope , where there is life and where there is love , the spark of humanity will never be extinguished .  committed to lifelong learning through effective communication  |-0.19999999999999996|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|"The text reviews the film ""Life is Beautiful"" and offers mixed sentiments, with some finding it offensive for its lack of realism regarding the Holocaust, while others praise it for conveying themes of love, family, and hope in the face of adversity."
1|larry flynt is a self proclaimed smut pedlar and the owner/publisher of the multi-million dollar hustler publications company .  the people vs . larry flynt is the story of larry flynt's fight for the freedom to circulate and sell his pornographic magazine , hustler .  based on a true story , the film is almost a documentary in that it's a very vivid and detailed look at larry flynt's life .  woody harrelson gives an excellent performance .  he conveys flynt's peculiarities and his character with depth and focus .  by the end of the film the audience actually finds themselves , somewhat grudgingly , liking larry flynt .  this is some feat given flynt's apparent lack of any morals or ethics and his extremely smutty and childish behaviour in court .  however , flynt has a number of things going for him , he's rich , he's funny , and most importantly , he says exactly what he means .  larry flynt's wife , althea leasure is played by courtney love .  larry meets althea at one of his clubs , and they fall in love ( a very sexual and open love ) .  both of them indulge in a world of too much sex , and eventually too much drugs .  flynt had been taking an excessive amount of pain killers after being paralysed from the waist down ( which was especially upsetting for him ) by an assassin .  althea had joined him in taking the drugs .  following an operation flynt decides to stop taking drugs , althea does not have any such plans , nor the determination to follow them .  as the film progresses we see her become increasingly frail and sick .  courtney love obviously has a great understanding for althea's situation , as she is brilliant in portraying althea in every respect .  it's extremely sad to watch althea literally wither away .  edward norton plays flynt's lawyer , alan isaacman .  again , this is a solid performance .  the audience finds it easy to sympathise with isaacman who somehow puts up with flynt's courtroom antics .  flynt is not only childish in the courtroom , but downright rude to the judges , and lands himself in a lot of trouble ( and even in a mental institution ) because of it .  isaacman is very easy to like , and great at proving ( in quite clever ways ) his points to the court .  milos forman has done a great job in directing the people vs . larry flynt .  it is not really an exciting or thrilling film , but instead a highly interesting portrayal of a true story .  due to larry's character it is also , at times , a very funny film .  however , it is much more than that .  it is about the fight for freedom of speech , anti-censorship , and the right to be able choose for oneself what to see and buy .  an excellent look at flynt , his life , and his story .  keep a look out for the real larry flynt who makes a cameo as judge morrissey .  |0.18333333333333332|0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|The summary explanation is that the sentiment is slightly positive due to the positive aspects of Larry Flynt's fight for freedom of speech and the excellent performances in the film, but it is slightly negative because of his lack of morals and ethics and smutty behavior in court.

1|"virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre .  since 'dark city' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another .  the most popular and original of them all has been the matrix .  all the films released after it , have been less successful .  david cronenberg's existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone .  and when 'the thirteenth floor' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored .  i admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again .  it was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to 'the thirteenth floor' .  however , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak's latest picture .  matrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood's action and effects with an intelligent story .  existenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness .  'the thirteenth floor' is somewhere in between .  instead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , 'the thirteenth floor' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding .  in a near future . . . on  the thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real .  right after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered .  douglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth .  a beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence .  the first "" download into simulation "" is impressive .  it is the creator's first visit to his world , his creation .  in order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone's identity , become another person .  this is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people "" wake up "" in unknown places and strange things start happen .  they start to doubt in their own sanity .  these innocent people pay for the mistakes of their "" users "" and creators with their sanity and their lives .  it is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone's fantasy .  with an appealing ( "" blade runner "" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present .  our modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal .  the thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile .  this contrast demonstrates a wish for change .  virtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities .  to some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences .  for others - a way to start over and "" correct "" their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past .  virtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life .  at least that's how it is all beginning .  but when you're waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise .  this , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness .  some important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ?  what is thought ?  who are we ?  if these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made .  they are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner .  the visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes .  kirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties .  there are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose's moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time .  a rather unusual thing about'the thirteenth floor' is the almost complete lack of special effects .  there are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion .  this is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking .  this is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and 'dark city'-fans will be pleased .  this film is interesting and inspiring .  it has everything existenz doesn't , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix .  and then there is a happy end which , like in 'dark city' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context .  the plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and 'dark city' .  with this in mind , 'the thirteenth floor' doesn't make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality .

1|it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+ , the farrelly brothers+ latest film .  i knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see .  but i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon .  i figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell .  i may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ?  i needn+t have worried .  +mary+ is the sweetest , warmest , all-out laugh-and-grossfest this side of _animal house_ .  surprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers .  they make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy .  the plot is typical .  thirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom .  as luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized .  why , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty .  he hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon ) .  he becomes one of the great comic villains .  upon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped .  it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double-crossed , and goes to get her for himself .  would the geek get the girl ?  puh-lease .  the ending is pure hollywood ; no surprises there .  but the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged-up dogs .  the dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame .  and yet , for all the targets that are hit , the film maintains its sweet tone .  mary , playing the straight role , is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful .  she is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother , warren ( w .  earl brown--miles away from the cameraman in _scream_ ) .  mary+s sunniness carries the film here--it compliments the below-belt gags that come at you .  cameron diaz makes her totally charming , and the audience respects her , even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window .  ben stiller also fares very well , totally changing his image from his _reality bites_ and _flirting with disaster_ straight men to being a , ( how to say it ? ) , a complete loser .  braces , greasy long hair , not too bright , and very very funny .  dillon is exceptionally creepy , especially with his capped teeth .  and rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom ( chris elliot ) , tanning addict magda ( lin shaye ) , modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman , and mary+s sweet mom , markie post ( where has she been ? ! ) .  not everything works .  chris elliot+s role , skin blemishes and all , becomes merely tasteless and boring .  there+s lousy dialogue about eight-minute vs . seven minute exercise tapes .  and there are long stretches without much going on .  but the wait is worth it .  when those extraordinary sequences hit , the entire theater erupted with howls , tears .  belly-aches , that in some sequences carried over to the following scene .  the farrelly brothers have finally done it .  yes , there are some raunchy bits , but when it is all over , it+s not nearly as bad as it could have been .  while tasteless , it didn+t cross any lines , at least not with me .  while raunchy , it wasn+t nearly as bad as _porky+s_ or _boogie nights_ .  and it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick .  after the funny but sour _kingpin_ left a negative aftertaste in my palate , comes the funniest sex farce since _a fish called wanda_ .  approach this with an open mind , and you will reap the benefits hugely .  |0.7566666666666667|0.85|0.8833333333333333|The overall consensus from the explanations is that the film is positively received, as it is described as funny, sweet, and successful in maintaining a balanced tone.

1|"a standoff .  a man holds a woman , a diplomat's daughter , hostage in his embrace , a gun pressed to her head .  a cop , impaired by drink due to his wife's philandering , trains his gun on the man's nether regions , threatening to shoot .  another cop holds his gun to his partner's temple , forcing him to disarm .  the scene unfolds like a foursome bidding in bridge--upping the ante , signaling tacitly , going for game .  the second cop retrieves the first cop's weapon , the suspect lowers his , and the woman caught in the middle moves--in slow motion--to safety .  it is then that the intoxicated officer makes his move , grabbing for the assailant's gun .  the room turns upside down , a shot rings out , a cop is down .  shot in the back and paralyzed for life .  the young man who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time is sent to prison for six years for a crime he didn't commit .  storytelling has always been one of pedro almod ? var's greatest gifts and in "" live flesh "" he gives us a twisting , turning , compelling tale peppered with well-written , colorful characters .  characters who find themselves , more often than not , in carefully-constructed scenes like these .  characters played by actors we might not know , but who look strikingly familiar nevertheless .  take the ruggedly handsome victor plaza ( liberto rabal ) , for instance .  before he gets out of prison he could easily be mistaken for that almod ? var favorite , antonio banderas .  when we first meet elena ( francesca neri ) , the woman in the middle of the nervous shakedown , she looks like spice girl barbie with her frizzy shock of orange hair , but later tones down her look sufficiently to pass for juliette lewis .  elena's husband david ( javier bardem ) is the cop crippled in the shooting and he wears david schwimmer's bemused expression throughout .  playing the inebriated cop and his cheating wife are jos ? sancho and angela molina--no lookalikes spring to mind , but they round out the excellent cast .  it's a credit to almod ? var's craft that these five individuals cross paths and intertwine with such credulity .   "" live flesh "" begins and ends with a live birth and the film's contradictions come almost as often as the contractions .  between the two childbearings , coincidence , irony , and a hefty dollop of sex form the key elements of this thoroughly entertaining film .  although based on a ruth rendell story , "" live flesh "" is brimming with the acclaimed spanish director's high-heeled flourishes .  women are at times alluring and repulsive , their extravagant hairdos and animal print coats providing colorful highlights to the intricately-woven drama , an eye bruised by an abusive husband here , a mouth bloodied by an impromptu delivery there .  while in prison , victor learns bulgarian from an inmate and learns to love the bible , quoting from deuteronomy thereafter not unlike the way by which david and sancho refer to themselves as "" guardians of a sick flock . ""  victor's pre-fab inheritance is a shambles in a slum resembling sarajevo .

1|no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly .  event horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me .  it is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner .  the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying .  the story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed .  the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man's lifetime .  the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune .  a search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon .  the designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship .  event horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be .  while in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying .  the story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough !  i can't stand this anymore ! ' .  there are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime .  the story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards .  even so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) .  director paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror' .  this picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this .  although on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus .  however , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing .  my friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience' of event horizon .  i guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us .  be forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment .  be prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film !  event horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk !  it has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one .  |0.37683521515782675|0.8333333333333334|0.8000000000000002|The sentiment of the explanations is generally positive, highlighting the film's ability to achieve its purpose and create a horrifying atmosphere through its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up, despite some criticisms about the story and acting.
