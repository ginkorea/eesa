1|"if you want some hearty laughs , then rat race is the movie for you .  this unpretentious little comedy , which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype , will have you bouncing in your theater seat .  and while the film fits neatly into the low-brow , slapstick school of comedy , one refreshing aspect is its lack of mean-spiritedness .  the plot follows a group of people chosen at random by an eccentric las vegas casino owner ( john cleese ) who must race from vegas to a bus station locker 700 miles away in silver city , n . m .  inside the locker is a duffel bag containing $2 million .  the first one to open the locker , gets the bag and the money .  what the group of participants doesn't know is that cleese's donald sinclair ( "" i can do anything i want - i'm eccentric ! "" ) is staging the race as a betting game for a group of high rollers at the hotel .  the participants include vera ( whoopi goldberg ) and merrill ( lanai chapman ) , a newly reunited mother and daughter ; disgraced pro football referee owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) ; italian tourist mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) ; randy pear ( jon lovitz ) and his family ; the bumbling con men duane and blaine cody ( seth green and vince vieluf ) ; and cynical young lawyer nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) .  various amusing encounters and mishaps befall the participants en route to silver city .  screenwriter andy breckman adds a nice touch by not having the racers try to sabotage one another .  the most side-splitting situations involve vera and merrill's encounter with the squirrel lady , a nice nutsy cameo by kathy bates ; owen's commandeering a charter bus full of lucille ball look-alikes on their way to a lucy convention ; the cody brothers misadventures with a hot-air balloon , a flying cow and a monster truck ; and the pear family's stopover at a barbie museum , which turns out not to be what they think it is .  the pear family situation is a fine example of the way breckman's script builds the laughs .  without going into detail , this bit segues from the museum to hitler's touring car , to eva braun's dark lipstick , to lovitz burning his tongue , culminating at a ceremony honoring world war ii veterans .  rat race's cast is first rate .  cleese is wonderfully devilish and madcap ; lovitz is , at first , a bit whiny , but his character grows on you ; gooding is having a fine romp ; and dave thomas almost steals the show as cleese's deadpan assistant , a man "" born without a personality . ""  the film is directed by jerry zucker , who knows something about comedy .  along with his brother , david , and friend jim abrahams , he was responsible for such hits as airplane !  and ruthless people .  a throwaway subplot , which is good for some laughs , features cleese and his buddies , betting on a series of outlandish situations , including one dealing with a hooker and pepto-bismol .  this is a fun little feature .  the only letdown comes at the finale , which is too touchy-feely and sweet , almost negating what came before it .  rat race is a summer sleeper , but it will keep you awake , as will the laughter of those watching around you .

1|i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night .  i went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success : personal growth and insightful humor about life .  i came away somewhat disappointed in this regard , getting some of the latter and not much of the former .  the basic plot revolves around billy crystal , who plays mitch robbins , turning forty .  he's now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original .  he's given a job at the radio station to his best friend , played by daniel stern , out of sympathy while stern's character works through his divorce .  his loser younger brother ( john lovitz ) comes to mitch's house to bum a money and place to live , all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday .  during the celebration , mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curly's ( the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance ) old hat .  after a business trip to las vegas , crystal , stern , and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure .  on the way , they run into curly's twin brother , duke , played by ( you know who ) jack palance .  first of all , the cinematography was beautifully done , especially the outdoor scenes in the desert .  the scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself .  there is some character development during the film .  the actors remain true to their characters and play them well , without overplaying the jokes .  the movie is a good basic adventure , with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict .  the movie is paced well , but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end .  humor-wise , the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film .  there are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake , but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel ( surprise , surprise for a sequel , right ? ) .  however , the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film's manipulation of the audience .  the film tries to pull your heart-strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other , like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend's butt .  this is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original .  there were also some parts which appeared unrealistic , like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn't worry more about water while tromping around the desert .  some strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here .  since the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich ( unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original ) , i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey .  overall , i'd say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story-line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original .  it may be worth the full price of admission , but a matinee would be a better bargain .  |-0.26666666666666666|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|The film's sentiment is slightly negative, as the reviewer expresses disappointment in its lack of personal growth and insightful humor compared to the original City Slickers, as well as story-line deficiencies and unrealistic elements. However, they still find it entertaining and humorous, making it worth a matinee viewing. Additionally, the cinematography is praised, as well as the performances of the actors.
1|"the "" submarine "" genre of movies seems to be one of the most intriguing and compelling types of storytelling there is .  think about it . . .  these films are completely based in reality , yet only a handful of people have ever been on one , making them fascinating to the general public .  they aren't like movies that take place on a plane or a train , as anybody can get on one of those .  and they aren't like movies that happen in outer space either , because no one's done any of that stuff yet .  when a new one comes out , you don't hear anyone say "" ugh , another submarine movie "" like people tend to say "" ugh , another boxing movie "" .  look at modern movies that involve submarines : das boot , the abyss , the hunt for red october , crimson tide . . .  all are well regarded as top-notch entertainment .  gladly joining that bunch is u-571 , which stars matthew mcconaughey as the executive officer of a u . s . naval submarine during world war ii .  we learn he has been denied a recommendation for his own command by his superior ( bill paxton ) .  mcconaughey's crew then receives orders that they will be boarding a disabled german submarine to steal the enigma , a german communications encoding device that has stumped allied intelligence .  the mission goes horribly wrong however , and as a result , mcconaughey and only a handful of his crew ( as well as a captured german ) become trapped aboard the u-571 in enemy waters .  the first great thing about u-571 is the film's opening sequence .  the german crew of u-571 are under attack , which sets the events of the rest of the film into motion .  it's tense , exciting and fascinating .  and i applaud the filmmakers for not copping out and instead keeping the entire sequence in german with english subtitles .  most movies with a scene this long would have panicked and had the german crew speaking english right away .  once the plot gets moving , u-571 gives us action sequence after action sequence , making the audience wonder "" ok , now how do they get out of this ? "" .  the stakes keep raising ( much like in executive decision , an excellent action-thriller ) , and even though the audience knows how the film will end , it's a lot of fun getting there .  i only have two minor complaints about the entire film .  the first comes from the scenes which follow the opening sequence .  while their purpose is to introduce us to the characters and to get the story going ( which they do ) , i feel as though it could have been done much quicker , and less conventionally .  i mean , did we really have to see the ship's crew at a wedding ?  because of that , you now know exactly what's going to happen to the groom !  my other gripe would be during the film's finale .  there's an explosion which ends the film that is one of the weakest looking cgi effects since the president's plane crashed into the ocean at the end of air force one .  i cannot stress this enough . . .  until a cgi effect can be made to look like a model effect , stick with using models .  yes , u-571 is historically incorrect and there are surely some specifics in the plot that people who have been onboard a submarine will tell you "" that couldn't happen "" , but the overall point of this film is entertainment .  it succeeds fantastically .

1|"we share the descent into darkness of a talented boy pianist .  years later we see his subsequent resurfacing ; in the mid 80's a damaged man walks out of a rainstorm and back into the world .  the movie charts the causes of his mental breakdown .  based on the life story of david helfgott , this australian film is a rich exploration of the pressures drilling in upon a child-genius , compounded by the looming shadow of a domineering father .  in the 1950's helfgott emerged as a child prodigy .  the film traces his relationship with his father , whose encouragement comes at the cost of demanding david have no life beyond that of the black and white keys .  david is offered places in the usa , but his father refuses to let him leave australia .  the effect this has upon helfgott is cleverly told via a single reverse tracked shot ; david is sobbing on the front doorway of his music teacher's house .  he is well lit via the external house lights .  his teacher isn't home .  we pull back and see that the dark front room's window has it's curtains open .  there , in a pool of blackness , is a grand piano .  david's fall over the dark cliff has begun .  instead of being told in a linear mode , shine jumps around in time , ala "" pulp fiction "" .  this narrative device works well ; we see david as a boy , teenager in london and mental-patient in various snippets .  the film then neatly loops back for its uplifting conclusion .  adult-helfgott's return to the light is told in linear fashion .  the lead role is played by 3 different actors , with the teenage-david ( taylor ) and adult-david ( rush ) standing out .  whilst rush is known for his tv work in australia , i think this is his first major cinema work .  his david , whilst clearly damaged - he keeps quoting his "" daddy "" in a babbling word torrent , cuddles strangers and grabs women on the breasts - is both touching and funny .  taylor's teenage-david is the more sympathy producing role .  we are mute witness to his gradual breakdown as the pressures just keep on building .  his father wants him to play the very demanding rachmaninov's 3rd , whilst his teacher wants to start him with a simple mozart .  technically this is a beautiful film and a lot of thought has gone in to the production .  i particularly like the use of slow motion and sound effects .  one scene has adult-helfgott happily babbling in a car in the rain .  the sound of the windshield wipers fades up over his voice .  with a clever subtlety , the wiper sound appears to morph into a rhythmic thumping , but of the same beat .  the image dissolves and we realise the thumping is the slow motion applause of a crowd .  but it's us being clapped .  we are young-david walking up to the stage for our first public show .  the music , as you would expect from a film of this subject matter , is critical .  and it works very well .  the 'miming' of the actors piano playing is faultless ( apparently rush didn't mime ; he really did play )  helfgott's life is certainly not without it's sympathetic people .  indeed his return to the 'normal' world is accelerated by his chance meetings with two very special women .  his ultimately uplifting story is a magic piece of theatre craft .  it shows that with the 'help of god' we can all find our way back home .

1|"well , i'll admit when i first heard about this film ( which was before dante's peak ) i could just smell what 'twister' had started .  so now it seems that we're in a full fledged return to the '70's disaster film era .  with 'twister' , 'dante's peak' , 'volcano' and soon 'flood' and james cameron's extremly expensive 'titanic'  i'll say first off i enjoyed 'volcano' much more than i did 'dantes peak' .  part of that is just being biased as i usually enjoy anything that tommy lee jones appears in .  i've been reading a lot about the movie being 'cheezy' or 'hokey' and really didn't see or think that once during the entire film .  i get bored easily and this film didn't bore me for a minute .  another thing , and boy am i bitching today ! , that bothers me is when critics and such go on about "" well thats not really possible .

1|"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  during the three years since the release of the groundbreaking success pulp fiction , the cinematic output from its creator , quentin tarantino , has been surprisingly low .  oh , he's been busy -- doing the talk show circuit , taking small roles in various films , overseeing the production of his screenplay from dusk till dawn , making cameo appearances on television shows , providing a vignette for the ill-fated anthology four rooms -- everything , it seems , except direct another feature-length film .  it's been the long intermission between projects as well as the dizzying peak which pulp fiction reached which has made mr . tarantino's new feature film , jackie brown , one of the most anticipated films of the year , and his third feature film cements his reputation as the single most important new american filmmaker to emerge from the 1990s .  things aren't going well for jackie brown ( pam grier ) .  she's 44 years old , stuck at a dead-end job ( "" $16 , 000 a year , plus retirement benefits that aren't worth a damn "" ) as a flight attendant for the worst airline in north america -- and she's just been caught at the airport by atf agent ray nicolette ( portrayed with terrific childlike enthusiasm by michael keaton ) and police officer mark dargus ( michael bowen ) smuggling $50 000 from mexico for gun-runner ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , who has her bailed out by unassuming bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) .  the loquacious ordell , based out of a hermosa beach house where his horny , bong-hitting surfer girl melanie ( bridget fonda ) and agreeable crony louis gara ( robert de niro ) hang out , operates under the policy that the best rat is a dead rat , and he's soon out to silence jackie brown .  meanwhile , the authorities' target is ordell , and they want jackie to help them by arranging a sting to the tune of a half-million dollars .  only through a series of clever twists , turns , and double-crosses will jackie be able to gain the upper hand on both of her nemeses .  although jackie brown marks mr . tarantino's first produced screenplay adaptation ( based on the elmore leonard novel "" rum punch "" ) , there's no mistaking his distinctive fingerprints all over this film .  while he's adhered closely to the source material in a narrative sense , the setting has been relocated to los angeles and the lead character's now black .  in terms of ambiance , the film harkens back to the 1970s , from the wall-to-wall funk and soul music drowning the soundtrack to the nondescript look of the sets -- even the opening title credit sequence has the echo of vintage 1970s productions .  the opening sequence featuring ms . grier wordlessly striding through the lax , funky music blaring away on the speakers , is emblematic of films of that era .  the timeframe for the film is in fact 1995 , but the atmosphere of jackie brown is decidedly retro .  of course , nothing in the film screams 1970s more than the casting of pam grier and robert forster as the two leads , and although the caper intrigue is fun to watch as the plot twists , backstabbing , and deceptions deliciously unfold , the strength of jackie brown is the quiet , understated relationship developed between jackie and max ; when they kiss , it's perhaps the most tender scene of the year .  tenderness ? in a quentin tarantino film ?  sure , there've been moments of sweetness in his prior films -- the affectionate exchanges between the bruce willis and maria de madeiros characters in pulp fiction and the unflagging dedication shared by the characters of tim roth and amanda plummer , or even in reservoir dogs , where a deep , unspoken bond develops between the harvey keitel and tim roth characters -- but for the most part , mr . tarantino's films are typified by manic energy , unexpected outbursts of violence , and clever , often wordy , banter .  these staples of his work are all present in jackie brown , but what's new here is a different facet of his storytelling -- a willingness to imbue the film with a poignant emotional undercurrent , and a patience to draw out several scenes with great deliberation .  this effective demonstration of range prohibits the pigeonholing of mr . tarantino as simply a helmer of slick , hip crime dramas with fast-talking lowlifes , and heralds him as a bonafide multifaceted talent ; he's the real deal .  this new aspect of mr . tarantino's storytelling is probably best embodied in a single character -- that of the world-weary , sensitive , and exceedingly-professional max cherry , whose unspoken attraction to jackie is touching .  mr . forster's nuanced , understated performance is the best in the film ; he creates an amiable character of such poignancy that when he gazes at jackie , we smile along with him .  much press has been given about the casting of blaxploitation-era icon pam grier in the lead , with the wags buzzing that mr . tarantino may do for her what his pulp fiction did to bolster john travolta's then-sagging career .  as it turns out , ms . grier is solid in the film's title role , although nothing here forces her to test her range .  i do have to take exception to the claim that this film marks her career resurrection , though -- she's been working steadily over the years , often in direct-to-video action flicks , but also in such recent theatrical releases as tim burton's mars attacks !  and larry cohen's original gangstas ( where she first teamed up with mr . forster . )  of course , it's true that her role here was a godsend -- a meaty a part as this is rarity for * any * actress , let alone one of her age and current status in the industry .  while jackie brown may disappoint those looking for another pulp fiction clone , it marks tremendous growth of mr . tarantino as a director whose horizons are rapidly expanding , and whose characterizations have never been better .  and while the film's narrative doesn't really warrant a running time of 155 minutes , it's filled with such sumptuous riches , ranging from the brashness of the vivid soundtrack to entertaining , inconsequential conversations between the characters , that there wasn't an unengaging moment .  with an impressive trio of feature films under his belt , it'll be interesting to see what he tries next .

1|" "" last night "" could have an "" aka "" tagged on the end of it that says , "" it's the end of the world , and we feel fine "" .   "" last night "" is about just that .  the last night of planet earth's existence .  the world is going to end at precisely midnight , january 1st , 2000 .  how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained .  nor is the event itself .  throughout the entire movie , no explanation is given as to why this is happening .  in doing this , mckellar ( who also wrote and directed the film ) seems to be trying to transcend the genre .  he's attempted to make a film about people , and how each of them deals with their last night of life .  the film contains no science fiction elements , which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters .  mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material .  the film is set in toronto , and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence .  there's mckellar , who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs , but keeps getting interrupted by a woman ( sandra oh ) in search of her husband .  her husband , played by david cronenberg , is spending the day working at the gas company , informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end .  finally , there's mckellar's friend , played by callum keith rennie , a man who has spent his final months trying out every sexual perversion you can think of .  mckellar has crafted a gang of the some of the most interesting characters i've seen in a film in months .  these people all felt real to me , especially the character played by sandra oh .  we can see her desperation , her utter need to be with her husband in the final hours .  rennie is good , too , as the man who wants to literally try everything before he dies .  he exudes such charm and likeablity , it's not surprising that we're rooting for him to get what he wants .  but for me , the biggest surprise in the movie is mckellar .  i knew that he was a talented director , but i had no idea he could act as well .  his insistence to be alone , much to the dismay of his parents , is something that most people would find difficult to understand , but as played by mckellar , we can understand his reasons .  he doesn't buy into the whole notion that just because everyone's going to die , he should immediately find some companionship .  he realizes the relationship would be forced , and they would only be together for the sake of being together .  mckellar gives a brilliant performance , and i hope he alternates between directing and acting .  my only quibble with the film is that we never find out why the world is ending .  i really wanted to know , and my need to know was hanging over the film at all times .  i appreciate the fact that mckellar didn't want the material to rule the film , and that he wanted the movie to be more of a study in human behavious .  however , in not telling the audience what the cause of earth's destruction is , he's left a big question that is in their minds throughout the film .  another problem is we never see anybody panicking .  i would imagine if the world was ending , and there was nothing to be done about it , a large segment of the population would be going out of their minds .  instead , we are treated to shots of a giant crowd partying like it's new year's eve .  i just didn't buy the fact that everyone had completely accepted their fate .  no one had the urge to "" rage against the dying of the light "" .  despite these small problems , "" last night "" is one of the best movies of the year .  as opposed to the moronic "" armageddon "" , "" last night "" treats the subject at hand with maturity and believabilty .  and bruce willis never shows up to save the day .

1|" "" a bug's life "" may not be "" toy story , "" but it's more close than "" antz "" was .  i really liked "" antz , "" basically because , yes , it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead , perhaps the year's most inspired casting ) , but there was , in fact , something missing from it , and i'm the first to admit that .  maybe it's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren't for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick .   "" a bug's life "" has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it's g-rated and not totally over kids' heads like "" antz "" was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that's completely innocent even when it's also remaining perpetually clever .   "" antz "" is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and "" a bug's life "" is more for general consumption , but it's also more entertaining .  it broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we've never seen before , and it's take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in "" antz . ""  it's also light and clever .  the visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of "" antz "" at least a worthy contender .  the characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films .  the lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly-less neurotic z from "" antz , "" but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z . instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely-titled hopper .  and for the romantic lead , we don't get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard-to-get julia-louis dreyfuss , who doesn't even come around until the very final frames .  not that the plot's really any better than the one in "" antz "" - it's basically yet another redux of "" the seven samurai , "" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else .  when flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time-conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season's donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won't screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers .  he runs into a group of "" warrirors "" who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses .  these bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in "" toy story "" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick-tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish .  the writers lightly touch on each bug's place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats .  grasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake .  a small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild-mannered squeal is a scream of death .  the bug city is a modern-day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says "" kid tore off wings . ""  and a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour .  around this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket .  meanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something "" antz "" couldn't do , and by the end , over the end credits , "" a bug's life "" pulls it's final punch , out clever-ing "" antz "" with a series of incessantly hilarious faux-bloopers that come just at the right time , when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left , and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money's worth of entertainment .  still , it's no "" toy story .

1|"when i saw the trailer for "" the sixth sense , "" i didn't expect much from it .  my snap judgment was that it was a watered-down version of "" the shining "" or possibly a late-entry in the glut of angel-related movies/tv shows of a couple years ago .  but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot .  it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year .  bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe .  at the beginning of the movie , he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work , but he is soon confronted by vincent , a patient malcolm failed years earlier ( donnie wahlberg-former new kid-in an impressive cameo ) .  a year passes , and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed .  cole sear ( haley joel osment ) is a withdrawn kid who is called "" freak "" by the other boys in the neighborhood .  weird things seem to happen around cole-his mother ( olivia williams ) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole hasn't moved-and cole seems to know things that a kid his age shouldn't-for example , that there was once a gallows in his school .  he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom .  the trailer gave away the movie's first major plot twist .  if it hadn't , the first hour of the movie would be more engrossing because we wouldn't know what's wrong with cole .  if you're lucky enough to have not seen the trailer , stop reading this review right now and go see "" the sixth sense . ""  anyway , since the trailer gave it away , i figure it's fair game to discuss here .  once malcolm gains cole's trust , cole reveals his secret : he sees ghosts everywhere .  dead people wander around not knowing that they're dead , invisible to everyone except cole .  malcolm gradually begins to realize that cole is telling the truth .  the box office success of "" the sixth sense "" has generated a lot of press about how horror movies rule the box office this year and lots of theories about why that's so .  i hate to burst anybody's bubble , but "" the sixth sense "" isn't really a horror film .  at its core , "" the sixth sense "" is a touching story of how a troubled kid and an emotionally-scarred adult help each other to move past their problems .  some scenes with the ghosts are wonderfully creepy , though .  one that really got to me : the ghost of a boy says to cole , "" i'll show you where my dad keeps his gun "" ; when the ghost turns , we see the bullet wound in the back of his head .  osment gives the best performance i've ever seen from a child actor .  it's hard enough to find a grown-up in hollywood who can give a subtle , realistic portrayal !  although willis gets top billing , cole is really the protagonist of the story , and osment truly brings the complex kid to life .  if only willis' work were as impressive .  accustomed to delivering catchphrases rather than dialogue , willis is stiff and awkward as malcolm , his most challenging role to date .   ( this is a bad omen for his next movie , "" the story of us , "" which chronicles the ups and downs of a marriage ) .  writer/director m . night shyamalan has a light , poetic touch that goes to the heart of the viewer without seeming sappy or trite .  he's also a skillful storyteller , as the movie's ending demonstrates .  only when the final secret is revealed do you realize that shyamalan has been hinting at it throughout the movie .  look for a cameo by the director as a doctor who treats cole .  bottom line : osment should get an oscar nomination , and you should go see this movie .

1|near the end of frank capra's holiday classic , its a wonderful life , george bailey ( jimmy stewart ) is feeling down .  he has devoted his life to others , and never fulfilled his dream of leaving his small supburb town , bedford falls .  standing upon a bridge above stormy waters , he looks down , contemplating suicide .  he has potential he hasn't fulfilled -- yet , he has done so much for others .  as a young chap , his ambition was to leave his hometown of bedford falls .  but times and ambitions change .  things happen , and he's stuck .  his guardian angel is there , and shows him that . . . it's  a wonderful life .  in a whirlwind tour of the town , george sees what life would be like without him .  he learns the moral lesson , that to live is a gift .  his earthly problems are solved .  the climatic scene is a marvel .  frank capra's film is a centenial classic -- watched and re-experienced by every generation .  wonderful life is one of the few pictures of times gone by that seems as fresh , maybe fresher , then it did when it was first released .  many films of the thirties through seventies have aged poorly .  but this one is a near flawless example of how well a perfect script and timing can mesh with first-rate acting , wit and suspense , glorious music , and terrific set peices .  the only even slightly dated scenes are those at the begining in which god has a long chat with clarence , george's guardian angel .  they aren't all that bad , but they remain corny and a little out of place .  nevertheless , this is one film that deserves its place in time , cinema history , and our hearts .  it can be equally appreciated by anyone of any age .  here is one genuine masterpeice , a classic that reaches heights and ambitions near perfection .  this crackling good mixture results in a film which is at once funny , exciting , moving and uplifting .  the film itself is almost a reversal of the life of george bailey -- there isn't too much to it , but capra and the gang ( various screenwriters , composers , actors ) plumet the material to its fullest potential .  the result is a film -- though not at first intended to be pigeon-holed as a holiday film -- that will always be remembered , celebrated , and loved .  |0.6|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|"The overall sentiment is highly positive, as the explanations consistently praise ""It's a Wonderful Life"" for its timeless qualities, excellent script, acting, and music, as well as its ability to be funny, exciting, moving, and uplifting.

1|"jerry springer has got nothing on "" wild things . ""  john mcnaughton's new thriller tackles more tawdry themes in less than two hours than springer's notoriously sleazy talk show broadcasts in two weeks -- bisexuality , threesomes , poolside catfights , slutty rich bimbos , even redneck gator-wrestling , they're all part of the movie's raucous , complex storyline .  but even trash tv topicality can't drag "" wild things "" down -- this crazy campfest plays like something you'd find late-night on the usa network , only infinitely more palatable and with a solid ensemble cast .  despite a smattering of needless scenes ( most of them sexual in nature ) , there's wicked fun to be had here .   "" wild things "" would be a guilty pleasure , only there's no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it .  high school guidance counselor sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) is well-liked in the town of blue bay , especially by pretty , popular kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave's most financially prominent .  hoping to take her crush to a physical level , kelly seductively slinks into lombardo's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser , but , the very next day , tearfully admits to her trollop mother ( theresa russell ) that she was raped .  before long , blue bay detectives ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) are listening to similar allegations from kelly's rebel classmate suzie toller ( neve campbell ) .  lombardo , who maintains his innocence , hires neck brace-sporting , opportunistic lawyer ken bowden ( bill murray ) to defend him in court .  the previews give away the following revelations , so if you haven't seen any of the movie's spots on the television or in the theater , you might want to skip to the next paragraph .  while cross-examining suzie on the witness stand , bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her .  to pay lombardo for the damages , kelly's mother breaks her daughter's trust fund and gives him $8 . 5 million .  but lombardo , kelly and suzie are actually all working together , and plan to take the money and run as fast as they can .  duquette and perez , however , begin to suspect that there's more afoot to the case than just false accusations .  if there's a major drawback to "" wild things , "" it's that it's oversexed to a fault .  the much-talked-about hotel room menage-a-trois between dillon , campbell and richards is a turn-off .  it's also cut short ( sorry , guys ) , and should have been cut shorter -- the movie grinds to a halt for pure titillation once too often .  what we don't see is far more effective than what we do .  another example of this is kevin bacon needlessly going the full monty in a shower scene .  er , no thanks .  also , bacon's duquette feels simultaneously underdeveloped and overwritten .  daphne rubin-vega , from broadway's "" rent , "" tries to compensate for a superfluous character .  theresa russell is just plain wooden .  and when , in the end , all is out in the open , ask yourself if certain scenes involving these three were really necessary .  but what keeps the movie from being throwaway junk is an engaging chain of surprises ( some predictable , some not ) that never seems to end .   "" wild things "" has more twists than a crate full of corkscrews , and most are so gleefully , over-the-top nasty that you can't help but be charmed by their absurd showmanship .  a great deal of amusement also comes from watching bill murray in a supporting part that appears to have been written for his sly comedic talent ; murray's a stitch , especially when pulling up beside the van ryan limo after winning lombardo's case and flipping them off .  and don't leave when the closing credits hit the screen , or you'll miss the film's best part -- four bonus flashbacks that smooth over plot holes while offering a few more tiny turns , plus a final scene that caps everything off with a great stunner of a bombshell .  speaking of bombshells , denise richards , who plays almost every scene in a blue bikini top , does the teen tease thing with a malicious allure that she was never allowed to flaunt in "" starship troopers . ""  matt dillon flexes his sleepy-voiced sex appeal , and pulls off personality changes with chameleonic precision .  neve campbell , lovely as ever except when sporting a blond wig , gives suzie a vengeful vulnerability that makes her the most interesting member of the conspiring trio .  re-edited and toned down a bit , the dynamics between these three actors could have carried the film to greater lengths .  but what we're given works well enough .   "" wild things "" is highly entertaining and , indeed , very wild .

1|the happy bastard's 30-second review  big daddy  happy gilmore as a father ?  of course !  that's the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy , a movie that's passable but isn't really considered some of sandler's best work .  he doesn't actually play happy gilmore in the movie , but a variation of him .  he's sonny coufax , a man who's living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one-day-a-week gig as a tollbooth man ( tollbooth willie ? ) .  his girlfriend ( kristy swanson ) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him .  enter a 5-year old kid , who's mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate ( jon stewart ) , who's off in china on a business trip .  from there , coufax basically acts as the kid's father , teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks .  he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker ( joey lauren adams ) , but , somehow , he also garners the attention of social services , who aren't particularly pleased with coufax's actions , as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid .  the reason i say it's not really sandler's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie , showing some odd feelings that somehow didn't really belong in a sandler vehicle .  i mean , it fits the movie's tone and everything , and sandler handles it well , but it's just oddly placed , that's all .  fortunately , it doesn't destroy the goofy glee path it's been following and it still makes you feel good .  sandler does a good job here , as he does in most of his movies .  rob schneider , however , is irritating as his friend , an immigrant delivery boy who can't read .  stewart , in his minor time on screen , is great , and adams remains a joy to watch .  look for steve buscemi as well as a homeless bum .  he's a hoot .  directed by dennis dugan ( director of happy gilmore ) , the movie remains a good couple of hours to pass the time with .  again , there are faults , but , hey , everyone needs to get emotional sometimes .  |0.26666666666666666|0.5333333333333333|0.5666666666666668|The general sentiment of the explanations is slightly positive, with some positive aspects mentioned such as Adam Sandler doing a good job and the movie making the viewer feel good.

1|" "" six days , seven nights "" is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right , a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare .  here's a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it's fluff , recognizes it's fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff .  of course , the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie's success ; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it's easy to forget what a funny guy he can be .  as his female counterpart , anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet , goofily charismatic performance .  the age difference ( ford's 56 , heche's 29 ) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that's hard to come by .  the story is a no-brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris , while heche is career-minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe .  robin , on a tropical vacation with fianc ? frank ( david schwimmer ) , gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti , so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there .  the plane crashes during a terrible storm , and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization .  a series of unpleasant , often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other .  meanwhile , back at the resort , frank is tempted himself by quinn's shapely female tagalong ( jacqueline obradors ) .  that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn-robin pairing , and while it makes for a few good laughs early on , it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin .  and since the film spends most of its time with the castaways , this flaw is only a minor inconvenience .  director ivan reitman keeps the pace brisk .  at a slim 101 minutes , "" six days , seven nights "" never wears out its welcome , where a lesser film could have felt like it was as long as its title .  michael browning's clever screenplay allows for plenty of notable one-liners ( my favorite , taken in context , is "" you mean _arrrgh_ pirates ? "" ) , and though it essentially boils down to one mishap after another , they're all quite engaging .  even the movie's more "" serious "" moments are played with a wink .  heche has been under undeserved fire over whether or not her private life with ellen degeneres would affect the "" believability "" of "" six days , seven nights "" ' heterosexual pairing .   ( so she's a lesbian .  so what .  deal with it . )  of course it doesn't , and here , her naysayers are proved wrong in a big way .  in fact , her chemistry with ford is what really makes the film click ; these opposites attract with the utmost , endearing electricity .  at one point , when the two are discussing the likelihood of romantic interest , heche asks ford how old he is .  after several wrong guesses ( "" forty-five ?  _fifty_ ? "" ) , he whispers his age to her .   "" you still look good , "" heche stammers .   "" i still _am_ good , "" ford replies .  she's good too , and together , they make "" six days , seven nights "" one memorable ride .

1|the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work .  this slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal .  when the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case .  upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home .  as the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed .  did dolores kill her husband ?  and did she kill her employer ?  dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller .  consequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn .  kathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance .  dolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time .  she dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks .  kathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff .  the rest of the cast is also very good .  jennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey .  david strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st . george .  judy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role .  child actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive .  the direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey .  the segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in terms of effectiveness .  the pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up .  however , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful--i particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots--and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film .  it would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited .  none of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe-wielding psychopaths .  although being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand .  dolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly .  however , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments .  on my four-star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars .  |-0.24999999999999997|0.85|0.7333333333333334|The film receives a slightly negative sentiment due to criticisms of its tepid conclusion, inconsistent direction, slow pacing, and potential lack of wide commercial appeal.

[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable]   "" rounders "" is exactly the kind of movie parents don't want their kids to see .  it's not that it's a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it's a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling .  and to take make things "" worse "" it proves this through its original , fascinating story .  there have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the "" noir "" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life .  this film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing .  matt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played .  damon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting .  mike's about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer .  but then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) .  damon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together .  he never sounds like he's reading from a script , nor that he's trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him .  the screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite .  immediately we get the sense that poker isn't for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel .  the game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers .  the gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man .  the film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act .  it concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit .  we learn only a little about mike , both past and present .  presently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling .  they go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike's childhood pal and fellow rounder "" worm "" ( norton ) is released from prison .  it's not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does .  technically , the plot isn't unlike many children's sitcoms in which the "" good "" kid's "" bad "" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid .  what this film does is use a different medium to tell that story .  mike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them .  where as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he's dealt and works with them .  sometimes they pay off ( i . e .  his ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don't ( i . e .  the fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) .  once things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood .  mike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all .  everything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything's a battle against the cards destiny deals .  one scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time .  matt's good at gambling but he's also got potential to be a great lawyer .  he could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there's stability but not much risk involved .  can someone who's gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ?  if the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test .  everything is told from mike's perspective , but we're finally able to recognize some things on our own .  this makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that .  it works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof .  what separates "" rounders "" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end .

1|as feel-good formulaic as it may be in its own way , shall we dance ?  also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you don't often find in american films .  this japanese import tells the story of a middle-aged accountant named sugiyama ( koji yakusho ) whose mundane life is shaken up one night when he spots beautiful mai kishikawa ( tamiyo kusakari ) in the window of a dance school .  intrigued by her melancholy demeanor ( and slightly infatuated with her ) , sugiyama signs up for weekly classes at the school -- and , much to his amazement , ends up as attracted to dancing itself as to his young sensei .  meanwhile , sugiyama's wife ( hideko hara ) becomes suspicious of his late wednesday nights , and sets a private detective on her husband's trail .  in a hollywood film , you can bet that sub-plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings .  in shall we dance ? , writer/director masayuki suo dispenses with it in a matter of minutes , using it to set up later character interactions rather than letting it overwhelm the story with pratfalls .  neither does he make the climactic moment of victory a competition between the hero and some mean-spirited token rival .  suo gives his comedy the graceful movements of his subject matter , allowing the humor to flow from the characters rather than forcing it upon them .  an opening prologue in shall we dance ?  goes to some effort to place the film in a sociological perspective , explaining how contrary ballroom dancing is to the japanese sense of propriety .  it's a forced message in a story which doesn't need such a culture-specific angle .  the dance school in shall we dance ?  plays the role of a singles' mixer , with everyone vaguely embarrassed to be there yet taking the opportunity to try on new personalities .  most amusing among these new personalities is the one adopted by sugiyama's co-worker mr . aoki ( naoto takenaka ) , a balding systems analyst who becomes a fiery latin lover when he dons a frizzy wig and begins to rumba .  sugiyama's awakening is less overt , but koji yakusho does a wonderful job showing a transformation of small steps .  it's a delicate performance with a huge heart .  shall we dance ?  is a fairly lightweight experience , which makes its final half hour rather a long sit .  suo crams a lot of exposition into very little time , including an unnecessarily detailed back-story for mai , resulting in a sluggish march towards the resolution .  it is here that shall we dance ?  feels most hollywood-conventional , attempting to blind-side the audience with a truckload of emotional catharsis .  suo might have been better advised to conclude with the small gem of a scene in which sugiyama and his wife take their first tentative dance steps together .  that's the real joy of dance shall we dance ?  conveys : its ability to create an intoxicating mood of romance which can soften the stiffest shirt .  |0.016666666666666663|0.8000000000000002|0.7333333333333334|The overall sentiment of the explanations is mixed, with some negative aspects such as the film being formulaic, having a forced message, and sluggish pacing, but there are positive aspects such as the charming restraint and delicate performance of the actors.

1|" "" the tailor of panama "" is a different kind of spy movie .  despite the presence of pierce brosnan , there is nary a hint of james bond flash here .  instead of big action scenes , leering super villains and empty-headed femme fatales , we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation .  based on the novel by john le carr ? , who also co-wrote the screenplay , the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year : a solid , well-told story .  brosnan plays andy osnard , a british operative walking on thin ice .  his british superiors ship him off to panama , making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement .  osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co-workers and his new home base .  when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that , since the creation of the panama canal , the structure is the sole connection between north and south america , he barely keeps from yawning .  brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007 , investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end .  searching for a way to get information on the government , osnard sets his sights on harry pendel ( geoffrey rush ) , an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite .  harry claims to be a transplant from britain's renowned saville row , but osnard knows his secret : the tailor is an ex-con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle's shop in an insurance scam .  he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt , having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm .  osnard offers harry a way out .  he will pay for information harry has gathered from his upscale clientele .  eager to comply , harry offers what he knows , then starts concocting tidbits to keep the money flowing .  before long , he is forced to spy on his loving wife , louisa ( jamie lee curtis ) , an aide to the canal director .  harry's little lies build , eventually taking on a life of their own .  osnard turns in reports about the "" silent opposition , "" a group threatening to upset the balance of control over the canal .  the bogus revelation proves explosive , leading to meetings in washington d . c . over how to best protect the vital waterway .  meanwhile , osnard wallows in his newfound status , enjoying the best the city has to offer and wooing an attractive co-worker .  and harry grows ever more fretful , fearing the consequences if his clients , not to mention his wife , learn about his lies .  geoffrey rush is wonderful as harry , fawning over his customers by day and savoring his rich family life in the evenings , all while playing secret agent in the off hours with his new benefactor .  rush makes harry a credible figure , presenting the various levels of the character so effectively that he remains sympathetic despite his duplicity .  after gaining fame playing larger than life characters , rush flips everything around for this role , using his energy to depict the quiet desperation of a man slowly realizing that the solution to his troubles may be worse than the original problems .  although she gets far too little screen time , jamie lee curtis imbues louisa with a depth greater than the screenplay provides her .  of the central characters , she is the only one that exhibits maturity and genuine self-confidence .  curtis is one of my favorite female actors ; whiplash smart , sultry and charismatic , she deserves more than supporting roles .  speaking of supporting characters , there are some great ones here .  harold pinter is amusing as harry's uncle benny , who pops up throughout the story in a number of creative ways .  also shoring up the proceedings is jon polito as a corrupt banker and dylan baker , who is a riot as a united states general straight out of the dr . strangelove school of armed patriotism .  but the most important secondary performers are leonor varela and brendan gleeson , both outstanding as two wounded activists .  their presence adds weight to the story , reminding us that beyond the charades of the leading men , there are real people that have suffered greatly over the politics connected to the canal .  director john boorman adds additional verisimilitude by shooting the film on location .  instead of using panama city merely as a colorful backdrop , he adroitly weaves in footage of all aspects of life there .  the metropolis , described by one character as "" casablanca without heroes "" pulsates with life , underling the folly of the two foreigners playing dangerous games that could have a disastrous impact on a great many people .   "" the tailor of panama "" succeeds because the principals behind it were bright enough to make it more than a simple entertainment .

1|perhaps it's time for me to say a little about my reading habits .  i really do like to read , and i've enjoyed many books in my lifetime .  my problem is that i'm a slow reader , and not very dedicated -- i'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time ( it's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina , even though i'm loving the book ) .  in addition to this , i typically don't read anything created after the 19th century .  the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting , time after time , that i haven't read any of the books on which these films are based ( the only exception , i believe , is great expectations ) .  however , i don't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film .  needless to say , i haven't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight , on which steven soderbergh's new film is based .  i can't say how faithful of an adaptation it is , or if it lives up to leonard's vision .  i can say that it's a terrific film , with sharp acting , great dialogue , and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh .  it's certainly a nice distraction from 1998's lineup of brainless blockbusters , all hopelessly wishing that size mattered .  out of sight proves that it doesn't .  i had originally written george clooney off as a one-note actor , incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair .  after seeing his latest performance in this film , i've changed my mind -- this guy can act , but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those $20 million superstars .  here , he plays jack foley , a middle aged guy who robs banks for a living .  he does it because it's fun , i think , but the film opens with him getting caught because his car won't start .  he goes to jail -- which is interesting -- only to break out five cinematic minutes later with the help of his friend , buddy ( ving rhames ) .  we're then introduced to karen sisco ( jennifer lopez ) , a u . s . marshall who , conveniently , is waiting with a shotgun as jack escapes .  fortunately , they take her hostage , and she and jack spend some quality time in the trunk together as buddy drives them to safety .  the central conflict arises when both jack and karen become obsessed with one another , though their respective jobs make them superficially incompatible .  we soon learn that the film is not told in sequence ( and , since this is a gritty crime comedy , flashbacks of pulp fiction should arise ) .  at first , i kind of felt that it was a gimmick , but i guess it was a gimmick in pulp fiction , too .  it's a fun gimmick , though , and soderbergh treats the material with enough humor that everything comes off naturally .  i've only seen a few of soderbergh's films ( i was impressed both with kafka and sex , lies , and videotape ) , but i think he's excellent at what he does .  he's an artist without making it obvious , and without being pretentious , which is always admirable .  he uses tricks , yes ( lots of freeze-frame stuff here ) , but it all adds to the smooth and quirky currents in the film .  as i said , clooney is terrific , and he's matched by lopez .  lopez is , of course , beautiful , but she can act , too .  i can sense that she's honing in on her skills , for she comes off more natural here than she has in any of her previous ventures ( not that stone gave her much help in the loathsome u-turn ) .  the two actors have arresting chemistry with one another -- the best scene in the film , by far , is the seduction scene .  the brilliance of this scene is also due , in part , to soderbergh , for he cuts back and forth from their quiet discussion in a bar to the physical act which takes place a few minutes later .  the scene is a series of soft nuances and glances , layered upon light dialogue , and the result is one of the better love scenes in recent cinema -- meaningful and engrossing .  the supporting cast is strong , led by the always-reliable ving rhames .  dennis farina , who plays karen's father , is good , as is don cheadle as the profoundly stupid villain .  steve zahn , who plays jack's nearly-brain dead accomplice glenn , steals all of his scenes ( and that's in a film where every scene is already at a high level ) .  all of the actors are helped by the dialogue and the intelligently-constructed script by scott frank .  out of sight is certainly a light film , although there are a few heavy moments that will linger in the memory .  overall , i can recommend it simply as great entertainment .  not every film has to change your life , and it's nice to see a movie that uses the art to tell a great story and simply to entertain its viewers .  as for the book , this film is good enough to make me believe that there might be something in the text worth looking at .

1|"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  among my fanatical ticker tape-worshipping friends , there's one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky's darkly original pi : the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which , through analysis , will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour .   ( an example of the mentality involved : if the stock price goes up like this , and then down like that , and then sharply up this way , it then will go * this * way . )  while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market ( knowledge check : prices up -- good ; prices down -- bad ; most of the time , at least ) and hence really couldn't comment with any authority , it's always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system ( and besides , if it were that simple , no doubt somebody would've already figured it all out ) .  the difference in this case is that while my colleague ( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual ) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster , pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character's psychosis .  it's also vastly more convincing with its argument .   "" mathematics is the language of the universe , "" insists genius protagonist maximillian cohen ( sean gullette ) in a cool , mantra-like voice-over which repeats throughout the picture .  since nature can be expressed in numbers , and there are patterns everywhere in nature , he reasons with eminent logic that finding the patterns will allow him to predict anything -- the ups and downs of the stock market , how many games the yankees will win this year , the flavour of jam i'm going to put on my toast tomorrow morning .  obsessed with finding the proverbial key to the universe , max lives in paranoid , self-imposed solitude in a seedy nyc chinatown apartment , single-mindedly toiling away with his monstrous homemade computer system .  sullenly withdrawn and plauged by debilitating migraines , the elusive pursuit of a mysterious 216-digit number his machine spits out one day is driving him into madness .  the story , then , is basically an eccentricity , but it's a clever , astute eccentricity , perceptively zeroing in on the modern mistrust of mathematical reductionism ; in an age where a dominant societal phobia is one's individualism being replaced by a series of numeric identifiers , max's all-consuming penchent for numbers at once creates a lingering , unsettling mood .  it helps matters that he's not a particularly likable protagonist .  all attempts of friendliness from neighbours are curtly rebuffed by max , a spindly , neurotic-looking individual who hasn't the time to indulge in pleasantries .  for a film which puts its lead character front and center ( mr . gullette appears in virtually every scene ) , pi takes a refreshing and effective approach in avoiding conventional aesthetics ; because of our ambivalence with max , we're not so much avidly rooting for him to triumph with a moment of epiphany as we're following him through this plot with a sense of mixed dread and morbid fascination -- it's more disturbing journey than quest .  still , we do care about max's fate .  teetering on the edge of dementia , he winds up being pursued by two different groups which want to pick his brain , both fronted by deliciously perky , resolutely cheerful representatives with inevitably duplictious intentions .  as we know , in films where paranoia is a dominant element ( see the truman show's laura linney character ) , or for that matter , in real life , it's always the ones who never stop smiling at you and are overly friendly that are the ones of which to be wary .  pi , a film that addresses patterns , itself intentionally adheres to an identifiable pattern cycle -- headache scene ; important revelation or bit of plot development ; pill-popping montage ; hallucinatory nightmare ( with decidedly cronenberg-esque undertones -- few other directors are as equally adept in bridging unsettling concepts and body-themed horror ) ; nosebleeding reality .  the repetitiveness , far from being tedious , is effectively maddening ; more than anything , the picture aims to get under our skins and take in events from max's claustrophobic perspective .  in this regard , it wildly succeeds due to mr . aronofsky's striking direction .  it's a rarity that a film so completely immerses itself into a protagonist's warped perspective of his surrounding , and high contrast black-and-white cinematography combined with constant usage of extreme close-ups lend a heightened sense of paranoia to the proceedings .   ( in some scenes , the stark composition in conjunction with the lumbering approach by mr . gullette make his character curiously resemble a latter-day max schreck , from nosferatu . )  using savage , jittery lensing and rapid cuts to create a sense of disorientation , the picture is often dizzying to behold , and max's effective isolationism is emphasized by shots from the so-called snorri cam , which keep him in plain focus while the environment races by in blurred bursts .  pi's raw , aggressive visuals are reminiscent of david lynch's early work ( in particular , eraserhead ) .  the film's sinister tone splashes onto the screen immediately with a dazzling opening credit sequence ably backed by a sly electronic score by clint mansell , and gradually increases in intensity .  still , amidst all its kafkaesque qualities and overall dispassionate mood , pi does occasionally display a sense of humour .  at one point , marcy dawson ( pamela hart , great fun ) entices max with the offer of an invaluable treasure : a one-of-a-kind . . .  computer chip .   "" isn't it beautiful , "" she coos .  a showcase for mr . aronofsky's technical virtuosity ( made for $60 000 , it's since gone on to capture acclaim at the 1998 sundance film festival ) , pi is an intriguingly cerebral story which , ironically , is perhaps the most purely visceral film of the year .

1|"upon arriving at the theater during the opening credits , i took my seat and prepared myself for what appeared to be "" hellraiser meets the crow "" .  but as soon as kiefer sutherland began speaking the narrative monologue , describing "" the strangers "" and their reasons for contacting human beings , i was hooked .  there was something especially compelling about the nature of his voice .  i knew from the start that i was going to witness the actions of his character rather than the actor attempting the character .  sutherland played the role as a true veteran .  upon the completion of his monologue , the camera arrives on sutherland in such a fashion that you can only wonder how long alex proyas spent on cinematography .  i would imagine , for a film of this caliber , that maximum hours of work were spent where they were needed the most .  the film flowed beautifully .  as i was being taken through the intricate regions of the "" dark city "" , a clever plot began to unravel , to the point where the last time i had seen such clever plot twists were in "" the usual suspects "" .  not to mention a series of special effects that would make james cameron literally turn green with envy .  but if you're not exactly the biggest sci-fi fan , caveat emptor .  get ready for the atmostpheric darkness of "" 12 monkeys "" or "" the crow "" without the boredom or depression .  the concept of the plot is as mindstretching as "" 12 monkeys "" was , however , so be prepared and be sophisticated .  and imagine a picture that finally does justice to the comic-book-gone-feature-film fad that hollywood has recently become abusive of .  dark city simply puts "" spawn "" to shame .  in fact , during the climax of the film i couldn't help but feel the strong presence of an "" akira "" -esque explosion throughout the general feeling of the movie .  so my initial predictions were wrong .  this film is anything but the meloncholy of "" hellraiser "" parts one through five .  i'm never one to base a film entirly on special effects , so know that when i give dark city  it's actually because the film contained all of the neccessary ingredients to keep me entertained and awake from storyline to plot twists to camerawork to even ( tsk , tsk ) special effects .  not since contact have i recieved such deep insight into the way the human mind operates and never this year have i been so blown away .  the best film i've seen all year , and easily one of the best i've ever seen  "|0.75|0.9166666666666666|0.8833333333333333|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is that the movie ""Dark City"" is highly regarded and praised for its clever plot, impressive special effects, compelling narrative monologue, beautiful cinematography, and excellent performances, making it one of the best films the users have seen."
