"" i , the jury "" is one of several cinematic renditions of spillane's books ( including a 1953 version which was made in 3-d ) , but this film differs from those earlier versions in one major way : it includes all of the sex and violence spillane wrote about that could never be given screen treatment due to hollywood's production code .  although this takes the 1982 version of "" i , the jury "" closer to the core of the original subject matter , it is in this aspect that the film received the most criticism , because it took this new license to extremes that many argued surpassed what was in the book .  rest assured , the movie not only includes a great deal of nudity , but it is thoroughly violent , especially toward women .  it features one woman having her neck slashed , a set of twins forced to strip before being stabbed to death by a psychotic sexual deviant programmed by the cia ( judson scott ) , and another woman shot point-blank in the belly by hammer himself .  no one would deny that spillane's writing has a definite misogynistic nature , but the movie seems to take it a step further by giving it such glorious screen treatment ; its constant equation of sex and violence , much of which is played with the intention of being erotic , is quite unsettling .  it's no surprise that the movie , like the book , fades to black with a dead woman on the floor .   "" i , the jury "" had a troubled production and was not well-supported by the studio that made it , which is one explanation why it didn't do well in theaters and many people have forgotten that it was ever made .  the script was written by larry cohen , who is best known for his creatively cheesy but nonetheless effective monster movies , like "" it's alive "" ( 1974 ) and its two sequels , "" q "" ( 1981 ) , and "" the stuff "" ( 1985 ) .  cohen wrote the script thinking he was going to helm the project as well , but he was yanked from the director's chair after only a week's worth of shooting because he was already $100 , 000 over budget .  he was quickly replaced by richard t . heffron , who has worked for the last three decades on a handful of undistinguished movies and dozens of television projects .  heffron was obviously brought in not for his talent , but because he could make the movie rapidly and efficiently .  it shows in the final product .  cohen had personal interest in the updated version of hammer , but heffron has none .  he shot the movie quickly and clumsily , and although some scenes ring true , most of them are flat , trite , and invariably dull .  the movie features numerous car chases , shoot-outs , and stunts , but heffron's background in television is the dominant tone ; despite the graphic violence and full-frontal nudity , "" i , the jury , "" takes on the air of a made-for-tv quickie , with no real punch or depth .  but the problems in "" i , the jury "" run deeper than the technical .  the central fault in this updating is mike hammer , whose character was lost in the shuffle while updating from the fifties to the eighties .  because spillane wrote all his hammer mysteries in the first person , hammer's character is central to the tale because all the events are filtered through his persona .  we never really get that impression in the movie -- there is no first-person voice-over narration and some scenes don't have hammer in them at all .  consequently , a great deal of the texture of spillane's storytelling is lost .  the period updating turns out to be a detrimentally bad idea because much of hammer's moral code is thrown to the wind .  despite his characterization as a hard-nosed , violent , misogynistic killer , hammer always stuck fervently to his own moral code .  the title itself , "" i , the jury , "" refers to his anti-establishment notion of being his own law .  unlike private eyes who seek out the bad guys and then turn them over the police , hammer both pursues the criminal and exacts the punishment .  in this way , he can be seen as "" above the law , "" but he still adheres strictly to her own personal code of conduct , his own morality .  the movie forgoes that aspect of his character , and hammer comes off not only as amoral in society's terms , but in any terms , especially his own .  if anything , hammer always had his professionalism , but the movie does away with that in the first three minutes by showing him rolling in the sack with the wife of a client who had paid him to find out if that wife was being unfaithful .  maybe the scene was intended for laughs , but it only cheapens hammer's character and is , by all accounts , a lousy way to start the movie .  the blame for hammer's character can't be laid on assante's shoulders , because despite some unnecessary marlon brandon-like mumbling , he delivers a fine performance .  spillane never once described hammer's physical attributes in any of the dozen books in which he appeared , so any actor could conceivably portray him .  of course , because of the lack of written description , those who have read spillane's books will have a strong personal notion of what hammer looks like , and therefore almost any screen incarnation will somehow fall short of expectations ( spillane , who played the character himself in 1963's "" the girl hunters , "" is generally considered the best of the film hammers ) .  the rest of actors are most un-noteworthy .  with the exceptions of alan king and paul sorvino , everyone who appeared in "" i , the jury "" were up-and-comers who basically went nowhere .  many of them ended up working in television ( like carrera , who had a short stint on "" dallas "" in the mid-eighties ) , which only adds to the made-for-tv atmosphere of the film .  maybe someday , someone will manage to get the right elements together and make an effective film rendition of a spillane book , but this is certainly not it .

0|"anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon's fact based novel the king and i , and it's big , expensive and soulless .  though good-looking , its lavish sets , fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson's script .  so much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting .  this is jodie foster's first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn't the best choice to show off her acting chops .  she's trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens , the uptight , widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king's ( chow yun-fat ) son in the ways of the west ( because "" the ways of england are the ways of the world ) .  the king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive , no ? ) .  the eldest prince is none too happy about this ( "" father , have i offended you in some way ?  why do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her .  meanwhile , siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma .  the king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain's doing which arouses suspicion in siam , putting anna in an uncomfortable position .  she is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king's prejudices .  he , though self-righteous as ever , can't help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly , quietly , develop affections for each other .  there is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king's younger daughters dies .  it's your classic deathbed scene , with the girl's mournful eyes staring at her father , who tries only semi- successfully to maintain his composure .  anna then comes in and cries a bit .  the sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer .  i'm usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched .  this remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren .  we never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care .  this ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorites of 1998 .  i do not doubt tennant's ability to put together a decent movie , but anna and the king , aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient .  the sets and scenery are gorgeous , but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur .  even terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia .  we feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger-than-life awe .  i liked both foster and yun-fat , who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles .  foster's generally stoic persona serves her well here , as she is playing a reserved , formal and rather underdeveloped character .  yun-fat is especially effective , perfectly conveying the king of siam's sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts .  what does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations .  the cast is great , the director is talented , and the budget is lavish , but this ill-advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole .  this is an emotionless costume epic .

0|"robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein .  mel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit .  unfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world .  it is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce .  the plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves .  this is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie .  mel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on .  the movie's scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice .  cary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard .  he escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis .  he also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil "" sheriff of rottingham "" .  a good adventure plot that is sadly unused .  elwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating .  neither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren't funny , nor believable .  perhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone .  this particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre .  much of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre .  chuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from "" rent-a-wreck "" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever .  scenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting .  perhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive .  the basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny .  mel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) .  the movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails .  the addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive .  the only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard .  he is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting .  if you can't , don't even bother watching this miserable film .

0|with his successful books and movies , michael crichton is doing well .  with early successes with westworld ( 1973 ) and coma ( 1978 ) , and recent films such as jurassic park ( 1993 ) , his films have been entertaining .  however , he seems to taken a wrong turn somewhere with sphere .  this $100 million mess by good director barry levison ( disclosure ) is dull , long winded , and a huge disappointment .  considering the huge budget , the all star cast , and a story by crichton , sphere is majorly disappointing .  the film opens with norman goodman ( hoffman ) , a psychologist who thinks he is visiting an airplane crash to console the survivors .  however , when he arrives , he his told by supervisor barnes ( peter coyote ) that he is actually investigating an spacecraft .  along with goodman is mathematician harry adams ( jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( stone ) and ted fielding ( liev schrieber . )  they investigate the spaceship , find a massive sphere inside , meet an alien intelligence called jerry , and basically weird crap happens .  unfortunately , something went wrong along the way with sphere .  the film starts off entertaining enough , but throughout this very long movie , it just gets sillier and sillier .  the film jaunts along from scene to scene , never fully explaining what is going on .  the actors and directing don't help , either .  hoffman is on autopilot ( and almost seems embarrassed ) throughout the movie , churning out dull lines , and probably wondering what the hell he is doing in this movie .  stone is useless , displaying no emotion , and fails to convince the audience that she has any feelings for hoffman .  the only person who seems to be having fun in this movie is jackson , who's funny as the mathematician who slowly goes crazy and entering the sphere .  but he's hardly in it , and by the end of the film he is just as dull as hoffman and stone .  the same goes for peter coyote , who hams it up as the officer , but is then killed off halfway through .  the director , barry levinson , who directed the better crichton adaptation disclosure ( 1994 ) messes up with the drama and the action .  the drama scenes are , quite frankly , boring , and the action scenes suffer from overkill , with levison throwing the camera all over the place ( much like the godawful speed 2 , 1997 )  the writing doesn't help much , either .  although crichton is great with plots , he's terrible with dialogue , and practically every line in sphere is a dud .  the speech is too simple , i was hoping it would be a bit more intelligent .  practically every line is just stating the obvious .  none of it is smart .  also , where the hell did the budget go ?  the sphere itself is impressive , and there's a few nice special effect shots , but where the $100 million went is anyone's guess .  there's a giant squid attack in the picture , but not once does the audience see the squid , even though the film has a massive budget .  i assume the picture was trying to build up tension by not showing the squid , and if handled correctly it probably would .  but the whole scene is done badly , and i was just hoping we could see the stupid squid .  finally , the film has no idea what genre to be .  levison can't handle his own plot .  it leaps from hokey sci-fi , to horror , and finally the shining/event horizon psychological thriller .  and , of course , the film is very much like the abyss ( 1988 ) , although in it's defense , crichton did write sphere before the abyss was released ( and is far superior to this rubbish . )  it's not all that bad though .  the plot is all right , there's a few jump scenes ( although nothing very scary ) and there's the occasionally interesting bit .  but overall , sphere is a big waste of some fine talent , a lot of money , and a potentially good movie .  not really worth seeing .  overall rating= review by david wilcock  |-0.6999999999999998|0.9|0.7999999999999999|"The general sentiment towards the movie ""Sphere"" is negative, as the film is described as a disappointment with a dull plot, unconvincing acting, poor directing, mediocre special effects, and lacking dialogue.

0|"tommy lee jones chases an innocent victim around america who is trying to prove that she did not kill her spouse .  the fugitive ?  not quite ? this is the plot for double jeopardy , another fugitive copycat without the action , excitement , and good acting that the original had .  there are other slight differences besides one movie being bad and the other good ; this time tommy lee jones plays a parole officer not a us marshall , clever huh ?  oh and the fugitive ashley judd was framed by her own husband ( bruce greenwood ) who needed to collect two million dollars in life insurance money not a one armed man .  both movies are on video .  make the wise choice and pick the fugitive .  there are so many flaws in double jeopardy , it is laughable .  while serving time in prison , libby parsons ( judd ) discovers that she can never be charged for committing the same crime twice .  learning that her husband is still alive , she decides to serve her time in prison , find him , retrieve her son , and kill her husband if necessary .  when the strict parole officer travis lehman ( jones ) stands in her way , libby decides to break the rules ( who knows why ? ) and continue her plan , despite the fact that if she gets caught , she's going back to jail .  director bruce beresford spends way too much time trying to convince the audience that libby misses her son .  every other scene , we are given a shot of libby staring and crying at his picture .  in an action movie like this , valuable time wasted on these shots takes away more opportunities for libby to get up and do something .  all that is needed in this type of movie is a short scene in which libby tells herself or a friend "" i miss my son . ""  nothing more , nothing less .  dr . kimble of the fugitive didn't look at one picture of his dead wife , his primary concern was to save himself .  libby at times shows this same determination but not nearly enough .  ashley judd and bruce greenwood both are excellent actors but if they continue to do movies like this , they will be typecast for the rest of their careers , kind of like their doomed co-star tommy lee jones .  winning an oscar for the fugitive must have convinced jones that audiences will never get tired of his i-do-my-job-whether-they-are-innocent-or-guilty roles .  people still pay to see his movies and he makes plenty of money so i guess he was right .  though i don't think he will win another oscar again .  the ultimate mistake in the script is what eventually becomes of libby parsons .  even if she was excused for disobeying her parole officer , the number of other crimes she commits while on the run are too numerous to count .  burglary , assault , grand theft auto are some of libby's slipups .  the message of the movie is you can break all of the small laws as long as you're innocent of the major crime .  hopefully criminals won't use double jeopardy as a reference in court for why they are innocent .  that would just be plain stupid .

0|while i am not fond of any writer's use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) .  so here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival .  strait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) 's blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life .  with the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good-hearted slackers to do ?  easy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student's ( or students' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as .  so instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends .  director alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper's diabolical plot .  until then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging .  that said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it .  the introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) .  one wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for .  not surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty .  the same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ .  whatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go .  _dead_man_ doesn't grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through .  as it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . .  like a zombie .  |-0.6833333333333332|0.8500000000000001|0.9333333333333332|The overall sentiment of the explanations is negative, as the user dislikes the use of cheap puns, criticizes the movie for its boring cliches, uninspired proceedings, and self-absorbed characters, and describes the movie as growing tiresome and reminiscent of a zombie.

""  he was alone in a world where he didn't know who to trust and it came across real well .  in chain reaction , keanu reeves isn't alone .  now that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia , vulnerability and confusion .  we don't get this .  we get him thinking he's still in speed , only now our sandra bullock has an english accent , probably doesn't drive a bus , and hardly contributes anything to the movie .  the producers here probably thought , "" hey , what if keanu and rachel don't hit it off too well ?  let's rope in that morgan to help us out . ""  well , keanu and rachel didn't hit it off well on the screen , and most unfortunately , morgan freeman doesn't help much either .  the only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder .  it's not really his fault .  once again , andrew davis just doesn't take the time to build his characters .  someone must have convinced him that this time round , cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

"" wrongfully accused "" gets off to an assured start , with an in-concert nielsen , touted "" lord of the violin "" by bare-chested posters , pulling a jimi hendrix on his musical instrument as hundreds of tuxedo-clad mosh in front of the stage .  nice touch .  most of the scenes that follow , however , never top the opener .

0|"the king and i , a warner brothers animated , musical feature , recycles the classic story of a woman who challenges the heart of a king , with obvious results .  when anna ( miranda richardson ) , a british schoolteacher , travels to saim to educate the king's ( martin vidnovic ) children , she learns that the king is treating his people unfairly , and must say something to the greedy ruler .  meanwhile , the king's prime minister ( ian richardson ) , the stereotypical villain , plots to overthrow the king , taking the throne .  the last , and most predictable , main subplot deals with the king's son ( allen d . hong ) , and his love for a servant , tuptim ( armi arabe ) , and how he conflicts with his feelings , and the ancient laws of saim .  not even the lone strong character of anna can save the unbelievably horrible waste of talent , as the king and i's problems could fill the blank pages of a journal .  i will only note the major difficulties , for it would take pages to elaborate on every detail .  the screenplay , written by arthur rankin , peter bakalian , jacqeline feather , and david seidler , which is based upon the play written by richard rodgers and oscar hammerstein , has some of the worst dialogue written in a film within recent memory , as every time the obnoxious king would shout , "" etc , etc , etc , "" i would cringe .  literally .  speaking of cringing- i did quite a bit of this during the rather short film , which is a classic display of terrible filmmaking .  besides the repetitive dialogue from the king , on the whole , the songs seem out of place , and unlike the lyrics , are unmagical .  the sole song which is used cleverly is "" getting to know you , "" which is used as anna shows the children the great outdoors , which they have never been exposed to .  unlike disney animated features , the king and i's songs don't add to the film , and are as uneffective as could be .  take the following scenario as an example , as the sheer horror of the king and i's music is at its worst .  you're being hunted by a dragon !  what do you do ! ?  sing a happy song !  martin vidnovic voices the king without effort or emotion- you hear the saying two negatives don't make a positive ?  believe it !  with the terrible dialogue that the king has , along with his awful voice track , the king is completely unbelievable , only shows mild signs of any personality , and the only thing that changes in the king is that he says "" etc . , etc . , etc . , "" more and more as the film progresses .  no personality at the beginning of the movie , none at the end .  and where does this character's personality change ?  hey , i thought anna was supposed to change him !  isn't that the whole plot ?  the prime minister's hideous sidekick ( darrell hammond ) brings his share of cringes as well - oh no !  another one of his teeth fell out !  hardy-har-har !  he is supposed to bring laughs for the kidlets , but even at age five i would have cringed while watching him .  by the way this review is going , you may think the reasoning for my hate for this film is due to not liking animated films- hence why i hate this movie , because the king and i is a disgrace to animation .  animated films , such as 1994's the lion king and 1998's the prince of egypt , are among my favorite movies of all time .  the animation team does design their share of well animated settings , so this makes it easier to take my mind off of the annoying king , until i realize that day and night switch back in fourth within seconds .  i have not read the play , or seen the oscar winning , 1956 film adaption , but from what i can tell , the screenplay for the 1999 version completely butchers the play , for the king and i is never magical , nor interesting .  if it wasn't for miranda richardson , who voices anna with feeling , the king and i could earn the title , "" worst movie of the decade . ""  instead , the king and i will just go down as among the year's worst .  the bottom line- avoid this movie at all costs .  not even young children , the target audience in this film , will enjoy it .  not the slightest bit .

0|"synopsis : cro-magnon ayla loses her mother to an earthquake and escapes certain death by a lion .  reluctantly rescued by a neanderthal clan who likes to have sex doggy-style , ayla grows up to become a blond , feminist supermodel who challenges the neanderthal patriarchy by throwing rocks and giving birth without a mate .  comments : allow me to state for the record that i find daryl hannah an appealing presence in movies .  she proved quite charming as the intelligent astronomer in the romantic comedy roxanne and equally creepy as pris in the sci-fi classic blade runner .  the clan of the cave bear clearly tries to capitalize on hannah as a selling point : the poster art bears a striking closeup of hannah in tribal paint and the video box prominently features her name in lettering the same size as the title .  not even her starring role in this turkey , unfortunately , can save it from being an unbelievable exercise in cheese .  it's so uniquely bad ( a film dealing with prehistoric man that actually tries , and miserably fails , to be serious ) that it's oddly fascinating .  the ridiculous attempt at drama here leaves the audience somehow transfixed , wanting to see how this dud plays out .  the clan of the cave bear is based upon a popular novel by jean m . auel .  to this day , the book possesses a loyal cult following .  i remember a dear friend of mine had a dog-eared copy of the novel she had read as a child with all the so-called dirty parts blacked out with marker by her grandmother .  i have never read this book , but i sure hope it's 10 , 000 times better than its film adaptation .  if not , then i'm at a complete loss to explain its popularity .  the clan of the cave bear immediately opens with a comically absurd scene .  a young ayla , looking much like drew barrymore in e . t . ,  tramps about in the woods .  with her cute little ponytails and fur wrapped about her , the audience's expectations of a convincing portrayal of prehistory are immediately shattered .  what follows is a laughably choreographed sequence in which an earthquake swallows up ayla's mother ( a blonde with fur pants . . . er ,  leggings ) .  tearful ayla looks on as the cameraman shakes the camera . . . well ,  as the earthquake slowly recedes .  a hungry lion becomes interested in her for lunch , but the screaming six-year-old manages to outrun the king of the wild and find a safe haven .  i won't detail the story any further ; this seems enough to illustrate my point .  this movie is really stupid .  it never even gives the audience a chance to suspend their disbelief .  also , the obvious comparison between the appearance of cro-magnon man in prehistory and the rise of feminism in our century is about as subtle as burning a wonderbra in front of charlton heston .  the movie doesn't just suggest this message ; it whacks the message into the audience with a two-by-four .  a blond , gorgeous woman challenges the social laws of a bunch of people in gaudy brown wigs .  she's of the "" new people "" ; they're of the "" old people "" with "" the memories . ""  yep .  we get it .  we get it .  the clan of the cave bear apparently received an academy award nomination for best make-up , which surprises me .  the movie depends upon a lot of make-up obviously , but much of it is unconvincing .  as stated before , daryl hannah is daryl hannah here ; she looks like she just stepped out of the shower all the time .  the rest of the characters have dark make-up of some sort smeared over them to look like dirt .  the face-painting that's occasionally seen is perhaps the only notable work here in my mind .  this movie also suffers from its new age trappings .  maybe the music sounded a lot more fresh or original during 1985 , but now it sounds dated and cliched , like poorly conceived elevator music .  add to this the film's faux-mysticism , including spirit animals and dream visions , and a narrator who sounds like a psychic you'd expect to hear on a 1-900 number , and you get a movie that has serious problems being serious .  the clan of the cave bear is rated r , though it's probably one of the most inoffensive offensive films i've seen in quite a while .  it contains several scenes of sex sans nudity .  the violence mostly consists of hunting scenes .  the funniest moment of the movie occurs when a neanderthal in love with ayla attempts to rescue her from a ferocious bear .  the bear bites his head off and the audience sees it rolling about .  although this may sound gratuitous , i'm sure , it's so cheesy that it probably won't bother most people .  the clan of the cave bear is a bad movie .  however , as i wrote at the beginning of this review , it does have the distinction of originality .  typically when i think of bottom-of-the-barrel films dealing with early man , fantasy movies involving dinosaurs ( who did not exist at the same time as man ) and raquel welch come to mind .  the clan of the cave bear tries so hard to be serious that , though it's so bad , the audience is still interested by the unique setting and characters of the movie ( which is why i awarded this turkey two stars ) .  i have to think that fans of the book would be disappointed with this film version ; however , i'm only basing this observation on the fact that the book is almost invariably better than the movie .  i shudder to think that it could be otherwise . . .

0|salaries of hollywood top actors are getting obscenely large these days and many find this to be the main reason for skyrocketing movie budgets .  actors who demand such salaries might be greedy , but in some instances they are quite justified , because many films would never be watched or even made without their participation .  proof for that can be found even in the realm of low-budget movies , and one fine example is breakaway , 1995 thriller directed by sean dash and starring ( in ) famous figure skater tonya harding .  face of tonya harding is most prominently featured on movie's poster , but the main star of the film is terri thompson who plays myra , attractive woman who works as a courier for gangster .  one day she decides to retire , but her employers are anything but enthusiastic about that .  realising that her life suddenly became worthless , myra starts running for her life , followed by professional assassins .  terri thompson being the actual star of the film instead of tonya harding becomes quite understandable after the scenes that feature former figure skater .  although tonya harding displays convincing martial arts abilities , her acting leaves much to be desired .  on the other hand , her disappointing efforts are hardly out of place in the film that lacks originality , believable characters and situations and actually represents anything that gave b-films a bad name .  martin sheen's brother joe estevez , whose character looks like he had entered from another movies' set , is the only bright spot of breakaway .  unfortunately , he appears in this film too little too late to prevent viewers from realising why tonya harding's silver screen debut proved to be her last film .  |-0.5666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment of the explanations is negative, as they criticize the salaries and acting skills of Hollywood actors and express disappointment with the film's lack of originality and believable characters, although there is acknowledgment of some justification for high actor salaries.

0|"if anything , "" stigmata "" should be taken as a warning against releasing similarly-themed films relatively close to one another .  of the four supernatural horror flicks released this year , it is clearly the worst .  i suppose i should have seen this coming .  after all , "" blair witch "" thoroughly creeped me out , "" sixth sense "" was mildly spooky , and then "" stir of echoes "" had its moments , but wasn't anything i'd lose sleep over .  clearly , the quality of the horror this summer has slowly been dropping .  is it then any surprise that "" stigmata "" is the dullest , most horribly executed piece of mtv-influenced tripe i have seen in a long while ?  no , not really .  patricia arquette plays frankie page , a hairdresser from pittsburgh who receives a rosary as a gift from her globe-trotting mother .  as it turns out , the rosary belonged to a recently-deceased brazilian priest .  the priest's church had been under investigation by father andrew kiernan ( gabriel byrne ) because of the mysterious appearance of a bleeding statue .  father kiernan is an investigator who has made a career out of disproving supposed religious signs , but this time he believes there is something to the bleeding statue .  his investigation is soon called off , however , when the frankie starts exhibiting signs of the stigmata , in which a person is inflicted with wounds like that of jesus christ .  father kiernan is initially skeptical of frankie' s story , considering she's an atheist , but once he witnesses the stigmata attacks himself , he dedicates himself to finding out what is going on .  he eventually begins to suspect that his boss , cardinal houseman ( jonathan pryce ) , is concealing something that could bring down the catholic church .  as it turns out , the dead priest had been working on the translation of a "" fifth gospel "" before they were excommunicated .  the new rupert wainwright music video .   .   .  i mean film "" stigmata "" is the sort of film that starts off ok and only gets worse .  indeed , it would have been good if it were a music video , because it's only interesting for about five minutes .  i'm not sure what wainwright is trying to prove with his endless parade of slow-motion , double-exposure , and extreme close-ups ( whoaaaaaa ! ! ! ! ) , other than the fact that he has the most swelled head of any director in hollywood and , yes , he has been to film school .  his camera trickery is interesting for a little while , but eventually , it becomes headache-inducing .  what this film needed is a second audio track to be played over the dialogue ( such as it is ) , with wainwright screaming at the audience , "" see ?  look at what i can do !  i'm an ex-cellent dir-ect-or . ""  maybe then he'd explain why he decided to start half of his scenes with slow-motion shots of water dripping in reverse , or why he included random superfluous shots as that of an egg frying ( ooh , scary ! ) .  if there was some underlying meaning behind all this camera trickery , i didn't see it .  just when you thought it was safe to get involved in the story , here comes a double-exposure shot of two patricia arquettes collapsing into bed for no reason whatsoever .  arrrrrrrghhhh .   .   .  then again , the superfluous camera trickery wouldn't bother me if "" stigmata "" had a story or characters that were remotely engaging .  though wainwright's vanity certainly doesn't help , he does seem to have been given a nearly unworkable script .  where are plot continuity and character development when you need them ?  case in point : frankie page is the character that ( i assume ) we are supposed to identify and sympathize with , but we aren't given any back story on her character , or any reason to like her .  the extent of her character development seems to be that she is a hard-working hairdresser ( who can somehow afford a cavernous apartment on the top floor of her building ) and she's kind of cute , so let's start the bleeding !  the fact that she's clearly not the brightest bulb in the drawer doesn't help , either .  according to frankie page , what is the first thing to do after receiving mysterious wounds on your wrists and back ?  go clubbing !  sure , that makes sense .  arquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking .  scenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable .  even though frankie page's life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon .  even more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances .  father andrew's religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic .  as for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , "" i'll get you , my pretty , "" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded .  trust me , i'm not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain .  what's worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible .  first of all , the film doesn't even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ?  how come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ?  actually , i'm not sure what frankie was posessed by .  supposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) .  which one is it ?  the answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time .  furthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church .  if you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you'll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library .  there's nothing the catholics need to worry about , though .   "" stigmata's "" religion is so off-base that it can't be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church .  if they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting .  i'm not catholic ; in fact , i don 't care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means .  it's rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as "" stigmata "" does .  it' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be .  i'm not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story .  maybe it's an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever .  the initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over .  like so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill .  so much is overdone in "" stigmata , "" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film's ( many ) flaws .  i'm also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering .  when we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing .  the dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and "" stigmata "" is it .

0|"john boorman's "" zardoz "" is a goofy cinematic debacle so fundamentally misconceived and laughably executed that it takes on a bizarre enjoyment quality all its own .  not since the rampant bumblings of one edward d . wood jr . has a movie been so silly and so serious at the same time .  of course , wood's career can be explained by two things : he had no money and he had no talent .  boorman , on the other hand , cannot court such excuses to explain "" zardoz "" ( or his follow-up film , the equally awful "" exorcist ii : the heretic "" ) .  boorman obviously had a sizable budget , a matinee idol movie star ( sean connery ) in the lead role , and although you wouldn't know it from this film , boorman does indeed have talent .  this is the man who made the slick modern masterpiece "" deliverance "" ( 1972 ) , as well as the autobiographical world war ii drama "" hope and glory "" ( 1987 ) , the slightly over-conceived arthurian epic "" excalibur "" ( 1981 ) and the father-son jungle adventure "" the emerald forest "" ( 1985 ) .  his films all show that boorman is never lacking in imagination , but sometimes that comes at the cost of coherence and taste .  if boorman is anything , he's ambitious , and when he succeeds , it's in grand fashion .  unfortunately , the bigger they are , the harder they fall , and when boorman falls , the resounding impact can be heard for miles around .   "" zardoz "" is meant to takes its place among the grandest of mystical movies , an obsession of boorman's .  his screenplay tries to elicit the same mythological connotations of the arthurian legends or even "" the wizard of oz , "" a book which figures into the movie's plot .  but , despite all this reaching , the resulting movie is more unintentionally funny than intentionally enigmatical or compelling .  the events take place in the distant year 2293 , but there is little of the typical futuristic movie-ness to be found .  in fact , things seems to have moved backwards , with people riding horses , shooting old-style guns , and living in large victorian mansions .  it's more middle ages than space age .  the world of "" zardoz "" is divided into two distinct hemispheres : the outlands , where all the poor , pathetic people live , and the vortex , where a select group of wealthy intellectuals live in comfort and everlasting life .  these immortals never grow old , they never engage in sexual activity , they possess psychological powers , and they live in a sort of quasi-utopian marxist society where everyone is equal , and everyone contributes equally to the society .  however , if one breaks the rules , that person is punished by being aged so many years .  if someone breaks the rules enough , he or she is aged to the point of senility , and imprisoned to an eternal existence in a geriatric home with others aged criminals .  one of the immortals , arthur frayn ( niall buggy ) , a squirmy man with a mustache and goatee tattooed on his face , is charged with keeping order in the outlands and forcing the residents to farm so the immortals can be fed .  like "" the wizard of oz , "" he adopts a god-like status among the people by flying in to their part of the world in a giant stone carved like a menacing head .   ( this flying head is one of the movie's opening images , and it's a dead giveaway of the lunacy to come . )  calling himself zardoz , frayn gathers a bunch of outlanders and makes them into a group called the exterminators , whose purpose is to kill most of the other outlanders so they can't procreate and take up more resources .  from inside his giant , stone head , zardoz bellows seriously laugh-inducting statements like , "" the gun is good .  the penis is evil . ""  that line alone is worth the movie's cult following .  one day , an exterminator named zed ( sean connery ) , sneaks into zardoz's flying stone , pushes frayn out , and goes back to the vortex .  once there , the immortals label him a "" brutal "" and study him like a lab rat , taking great , perverse care in exploring his sexuality , which is a mystery to them .  they seem especially interested in his ability to gain an erection , and there is one downright hilarious sequence where a bunch of scantily-clad female scientists show zed erotic footage on a video screen in an attempt to determine what gets him worked up .  i say "" hilarious "" because that is exactly what "" zardoz "" is .  it is obvious that boorman did not intend it to be so ; he made this film with the straightest of faces , although i have a hard time believing that as production moved forward , he didn't get even the slightest inkling of how patently ridiculous it was becoming .  just looking at connery is enough to give one the giggles - he spends most of the film running around in a red loin cloth that resembles a diaper , a mane of hair braided halfway down his back , a wyatt earp-style handlebar mustache , and a pair of thigh-high patent leather boots that would look more appropriate on a cheap hollywood hooker .  boorman made the film right after the critical and financial success of "" deliverance , "" which is the only reason i can imagine a studio would green-light this effort .  he attracted some rich talent on both sides of the camera , including cinematographer geoffrey unsworth ( "" 2001 "" ) , whose striking visuals are about the only good thing in "" zardoz "" besides the inadvertent humor .  sean connery had made his last james bond film in 1971 , and perhaps he was looking for a change in pace .  he got exactly that in "" zardoz , "" and it's a wonder it didn't end his career .  i'm sure boorman intended for this movie to make some grand statements .  is it a treatise about the infallibility of eternal life ?  is it a condemnation of those who consider growing old to be a bad thing ?  or is it a social statement , something about the inherent negativity of class distinctions and the violence it creates ?  karl marx might like it if he were more like timothy leary .  come to think of it , maybe boorman made it as an extended lsd trip .  people high on illicit substances are the only ones i can imagine enjoying this asinine silliness as anything more than a completely unintentional comedy .

0|the kids in the hall are an acquired taste .  it took at least a season of watching their show on hbo before i became a believer .  maybe after watching a half dozen kids in the hall movies , they would grow into the big screen .  my recommendation is that , unless you are a big fan of the kids , skip the film .  as it is , their first--and most likely only--attempt at a full length film lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on tv .  a big-budget and glossy production can not make up for a lack of spontaneity that permeates their tv show .  the kids go through the motions , but you get the feeling that they arent really having fun doing so .  and this makes it more difficult for the audience to enjoy their antics .  brain candy is a bunch of skits tied together by the story of a pharmaceutical company that develops a new drug to cure depression .  in typical sketch-comedy tradition , each actor plays several roles .  doctor cooper ( kevin mcdonald ) and his team create the drug .  then , under pressure from don roritor ( mark mckinney ) , founder and president of roritor pharmaceuticals , dr . cooper releases the drug into the marketplace .  the ensuing distribution of the new happy pill throughout the populace drives the rest of the film .  at about 90 minutes , brain candy still seems long .  the best thing about sketch comedy--and the kids are no exception--is the ability to quickly deliver the laughs , then go on to another quick skit .  but with the additional set-up necessary in telling a longer , coherent story , the laughs just dont come fast enough .  strangely , the show is even more tame than it was when on cable tv .  the movie makes several attempts at risqueness--mostly by pointing up the gayness of one of scott thompsons characters--but they seem almost forced ; as if they have to live up to a pg rating .  one of the best bits , though , does make use of thompsons naked buttocks ; we see him charging into battle--going to have sex with some guys taking a shower .  in the classic of this genre , monty python pulled off this delicate balancing act between plot advancement and punchline delivery for most of the holy grail .  the kids , unfortunately , are not up to the task .  there are some amusing moments , to be sure , but not enough to make the experience an enjoyable one .  |-0.6333333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|"The overall sentiment towards ""The Kids in the Hall"" film is negative, as it lacks the qualities that made their comedy work on TV, the laughs don't come fast enough, it is more tame than the TV show and the attempts at risqueness feel forced.

0|"there was a time when john carpenter was a great horror director .  of course , his best film was 1978's masterpiece , "" halloween , "" but he also made 1980's "" the fog , "" and 1987's underrated , "" prince of darkness . ""  heck , he even made a good film in 1995 , with "" in the mouth of madness . ""  but something terribly wrong happened to him in 1992 , with the terrible comedy , "" memoirs of an invisible man . ""  somehow , carpenter has lost his touch , with junk like his failed 1995 remake of , "" village of the damned , "" to his uninspired 1996 sequel , "" escape from l . a . "" those movies , however , look like cinematic works of art compared to his latest film , "" john carpenter's vampires . ""  if i was him , i definately wouldn't want to put my own name in the title .  it is a sad state of affairs when carpenter can make something as misguided and flatly written and filmed as , "" vampires . ""  the story is simple .  jack crow ( james woods ) is a vampire hunter who , along with one of his partners , montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and a prostitute , katrina ( sheryl lee ) , survives an attack from the master vampire , valek ( thomas ian griffith ) .  since katrina was previously bitten by him , crow takes her along because anyone who is bitten by valek becomes telepathically linked to him until they themselves turn into vampires a couple days later , and crow is hoping to find him with the help of her .  it seems valek's mission is to steal a black , wooden cross from a roman catholic church that will enable him to become so powerful that sunlight will not destroy him .  my question is : how many time have we seen this same story played out ?  well , the answer is just about as many times as a better version of the story has been made .   "" john carpenter's vampires , "" sadly enough , is one of the most unscary horror films i've ever seen .  in fact , there isn't even one suspenseful moment in the whole 105-minute running time .  the non-stop vampire attack sequences are stylelessly filmed , without any interesting camera work , which is usually a trademark of carpenter's .  and then we come to the screenplay , which , as far as i can tell , is nearly non-existent .  there is no story development , and there isn't even an attempt to flesh out the characters .  james woods can be a good actor , but he has nothing to do here but to say a couple of "" pseudo "" -clever lines of dialogue .  daniel baldwin has some potential , but his character comes off as being very dense .  and sheryl lee ( faring much better as laura palmer in "" twin peaks "" ) , like all of the female characters , plays an offensive stereotypical whore .  there is not an ounce of intelligence , or excitement in , "" john carpenter's vamires , "" which is very disheartening coming from an ex-fan of carpenter's .  he has said that he turned down directing , "" halloween : h20 , "" because he couldn't work up any excitement for it .  and yet , when asked about a "" vampires "" sequel , he said he would be happy to do it .  i think that's a definite sign that carpenter has finally lost any trace of his lasting talent , not to mention a significant number of iq points .

0|"two party guys bob their heads to haddaway's dance hit "" what is love ? ""  while getting themselves into trouble in nightclub after nightclub .  it's barely enough to sustain a three-minute _saturday_night_live_ skit , but _snl_ producer lorne michaels , _clueless_ creator amy heckerling , and paramount pictures saw something in the late night television institution's recurring "" roxbury guys "" sketch that would presumably make a good feature .  emphasis on the word "" presumably . ""  _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ takes an already-thin concept and tediously stretches it far beyond the breaking point--and that of viewers' patience levels .  the first five minutes or so of _roxbury_ play very much like one of the original "" roxbury guys "" skits .  with "" what is love ? ""  blaring on the soundtrack , the brotherly duo of doug and steve butabi ( chris kattan and will ferrell ) bob their heads , scope out "" hotties "" at clubs , and then bump a select few with violent pelvic thrusts .  there is one crucial difference , however--these guys speak .  that little fact has been used as justification for the film's existence , that the butabis' newfound capacity for speech would open up a whole new set of doors for the characters .  the doors opened by director john fortenberry and screenwriters steve koren , ferrell , and kattan are new , that's for sure , but they all lead to comic dead ends .  there is no story per se , only a loosely structured and linked series of subplots .  the brothers literally run into ( or , rather , get run into , as in by car ) richard grieco of _21_jump_street_ fame , and through him they gain entrance into the exclusive roxbury club .  there , they meet a hotshot club owner ( chazz palminteri , conspicuously uncredited--can you blame him ? ) , who takes an interest in an idea of theirs .  meanwhile , the bros' overbearing father ( dan hedaya ) wants them to stop clubbing .  when doug refuses and the dimwitted steve obeys his father , a rift is created between the two .  the narrative messiness of _roxbury_ would have been forgivable if all that went on were the slightest bit funny , but virtually none of it is .  the assembled press audience mostly sat stonily silent throughout the entire film , with the one big exception being a big laugh near the end .  alas , the joke--a rather lazy takeoff on _jerry_maguire_--will only strike a chord with people who have seen that film .  granted , a lot of people _have_ seen _jerry_maguire_ , but the fact that the film's best joke is completely dependent on one's familiarity with another film says a lot about _roxbury_'s lack of inspiration .  that lack of inspiration can be traced back to the insipid characters themselves .  like too many of the skits on the current incarnation of _saturday_night_live_ , "" the roxbury guys "" is a one-joke sketch that never once suggests that the characters have enough comic life in them to survive outside of the sketch context .  after watching one of the "" roxbury "" skits on snl , this is what you come away with from the characters : they bob their heads to "" what is love ? "" ,  bump unsuspecting women , and . . . that's all .  after watching _a_night_at_the_roxbury_ , you'll be left with exactly the same .
