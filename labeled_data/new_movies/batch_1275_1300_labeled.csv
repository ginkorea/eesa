0|"porter stoddard ( warren beatty ) is a successful architect married to successful fabric designer ellie ( diane keaton ) for twenty-five years .  they and best friends mona ( goldie hawn ) and griffin ( garry shandling ) are about to face marital crises in a film most well known for its torturous path to the screen , "" town and country . ""   "" town and country "" has a pedigree befitting it's title with an all star cast photographed by oscar nominated cinematographer william fraker and mouthing the words of screenwriter buck henry ( "" the graduate "" ) under the direction of peter chelsom ( "" funny bones "" ) .  after years of reports of budget overruns and reshoots and the racking up twelve different release dates , the media has been prepped for beatty's next "" ishtar . ""  so , is it that bad ?  the answer is no .  but it's not very good either .  the major problem with "" town and country "" is that it's unstructured and random .  stoddard is immediately established as a philanderer , having just bedded a flaky cellist ( nastassja kinski ) .  next scene finds him and ellie celebrating their anniversary in paris with mona and griffin .  then mona spies griffin hustling a redhead into a motel and begins divorce proceedings ( buck henry cameos as both couples' divorce lawyer ) .  ellie thinks she's overeacting , but sends porter to support mona on a trip to check out her family's mississippi manse .  the two childhood friends end up in bed together , making us wonder why they'd never become a couple to begin with .  back home , their second coupling is interrupted by ellie bursting in to tell mona she thinks porter's cheating on her .  porter goes off on a trip with griffin to sun valley , idaho to have more comic misadventures with wacky women as griffin attempts to tell him that he's gay .  the four friends , along with every woman porter's dallied with , all end up back in new york city somewhat happily ever after .  although the film begins promisingly , resembling a woody allen take on new york city wasps , too many strands drift off into nowhere .  the stoddard household is huge , containing two adult children ( josh hartnett , "" the virgin suicides "" and tricia vessey , "" kiss the girls "" ) , their colorful bedmates and a maid who's just imported her shirtless boyfriend from the rainforest back home .  after an amusing early scene that has porter overhearing three bouts of lovemaking while in search of a nocturnal snack , the six supporting players are dropped except for an out-of-nowhere appearance by the formerly forgotten son .  porter's romantic misadventures with women ( other than mona ) are equally mishandled .  once the marital discord begins , the film seems as if it was editted with a machete , stopping and starting , never regaining its rhythm .  while beatty gets off a few tart observations , his character is mostly passive and bemused .  maybe we're supposed to feel sympathy for an adulterer who doesn't initiate his own sex romps ?  keaton's ellie has a trusting nature that's a result of her own self involvement resulting in an unlikeable character .  hawn smartly recycles her mature sex kitten wives of "" the out of towners "" and "" the first wives' club "" while shandling's relegated to true second banana status .  kinski is bland and unmotivated .  andie macdowell takes a weirdly unappealing role and does what she can with the screenplay's most bizarre subplot , which finds charlton heston as her rifle toting , billionaire daddy and marian seldes as her alcoholic , wheelchair-bound , foul-mouthed mother .  heston and seldes are fun , as is jenna elfman as a sun valley bait and tackle salesgirl who brings porter and griffin to a halloween party .  oscar nominatored cinematographer william fraker gives the film a nice look , but director chelsom shows none of the quirkily and blackly humorous depth he brought to films like "" hear my song "" and "" funny bones . ""  the script is this film's weakest link - it's telling that most of the ( few ) laughs come from old-fashioned physical slapstick and the sight of beatty in a bear suit .  while "" town and country "" isn't exactly painful to sit through , it mostly just lays there .

0|" * * the following review contains spoilers * *   "" please someone stop joel schumacher before he vomits into a film canister again and tries to pass it off as a movie . ""  -- chuck dowling , the jacksonville film journal  i wrote the above sentence in my review for 1997's batman and robin .  apparently , no one heard my words .  oh , how i wish you had heard them .  oh how i wish someone had stopped him . . .  because he's done it again .  the plot of 8mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore , a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale .  in fact , it was everything that 8mm is not .  in the opening minutes of 8mm , we see private detective tom welles ( nicolas cage ) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u . s . government .  keep this fact in mind , cage is trusted with an important case , which he solves .  he returns home to his wife and new daughter , and even finds time to rake his yard ( keep that in mind too , it's important as well ) .  he's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery .  after her husband's death she comes across a film in his private safe .  it appears to be snuff film , a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera .  the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film , hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film .  so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film .  the main problem with 8mm is that the whole film is completely pointless .  welles is actually selected for the case by the old woman's lawyer ( anthony heald , an actor who always plays the same type of character , that being a bad guy ) .  when you first see him , your first instinct is that he's behind the whole thing .  the choice of casting does the film in .  then , as welles begins his investigation , at times we will see a shadowy figure following him .  the only person it could possibly be is the lawyer ( or someone sent by the lawyer ) because no one knows welles is even investigating anything yet .  so your first instinct has now been confirmed .  then , when it is in fact revealed that the lawyer is a part of the whole thing , he tells welles that he was chosen for the case because he was young and inexperienced ( in one of those ridiculous "" since we're going to kill you anyway , why not tell you the whole thing "" moments ) .  but earlier when we see welles being hired for the case he's told that he was hired because he comes highly recommended .  huh ?  also , when the lawyer reveals himself to be a part of the whole thing , his main goal is to get the film back .  so why did he give it up in the first place ? !  the lawyer had the film the whole time , then gave it away to the private detective thinking that he would just give up on the case and return the film ? !  it's totally absurd . . .  and this is the screenwriter of seven ?  late in the film there's a confrontation between all the main characters , and after a struggle one of the character's guns ends up underneath a car .  cage , who has been handcuffed to a bed , is rapidly trying to get to his gun , which is on a table .  james gandolfini's character goes for the gun under the car in what is supposed to be a scene of "" suspense "" .  you see , the gun is just slightly out of reach from the side of the car he's trying to reach it from , and so instead of going around the car to the other side ( where he can easily reach it ) he just keeps stretching .  go around to the other side of the car ! !  this goes on for minutes .  then , after cage gets his gun , gandolfini then decides it would be best to go around to the other side of the car .  boy , schumacher is really really getting on my nerves .  i think the final straw would be when cage returns home , devastated by everything that he's seen on this case , and then is no longer able to rake his lawn !  we actually see a shot of him pathetically poking at leaves in his yard .  other things that bugged me about 8mm : one would be the music , if you can call it that .  whenever the score starts up , it sounds like techno music , and then this awful indian or middle eastern type music will accompany it .  awful decision there joel .  another is cage's performance .  at this point he's capable of a wide range of performances , either good or bad .  for 8mm , he delivers a very wooden one , and only shines when he's interacting with joaquin phoenix ( who gives a great performance as a porn shop clerk with a heart of gold who helps cage with his case ) .  you're capable of much better mr . cage .  now as for you mr . schumacher . . .  i'm starting to doubt if you're capable of anything else besides urinating onto the institution of american cinema .

0|there have been bad films in recent years : 'mr .  magoo' was by far the worst ever made , the spectacularly bad 'blue in the face' , the horrible 'baby genuises' and now 'i woke up early the day i died' .  it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie .  the film's acting ( if that's what you want to call it ) is well mediocre to me .  loaded with a sensational cast you would think that the cast would at least save the film a bit , boy was i wrong .  after escaping from a mental institution 'the thief' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty .  he turns to burglary to survive , robs a loan back , kills the loan officer and runs with thousands .  a country-wide man hunt is on for him to catch him and bring him down .  he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later , comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere .  now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back , ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying .  a film which was based on a 'long-lost' script by ed wood , i have only one question : no dialogue , only music and movement where exactly is the point ?  the film moves along at a rather slow pace , but does have one advantage : the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some .  it opens with a fun , innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that .  some of the low points are when 'the thief' steals a woman's purse , and then she faints , sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom 'the thief' kills to the music of 'psycho' .  come on people get some new ideas already !  what's even worse is that the film has no plot at all .  well to a certain extent it does , but who cares by the time the middle of the film arrives we're bored out of our mind and ready for something fun and exciting to happen .  'i woke up early the day i died' is a perfectly bad film .  it shows us how low filmmakers get sometimes just when desperate to make a movie .  even with the huge cast talent , the film is a waste of my time and certainly a waste of yours .  |-0.8000000000000002|0.9|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment towards the films mentioned is strongly negative, with descriptions such as ""bad"", ""worst ever made"", ""horrible"", and ""mediocre"" acting.

0|it would be hard to choose the best american political thriller .  some people would probably pick the manchurian candidate and others ( myself included ) would pick seven days in may .  both those films were tense exercises in chills .  the two films came out within two years of each other and both were directed by the same man , john frankenheimer .  but that was 1962 and 1964 respectively .  for most of the rest of his career frankenheimer has turned out some decent films , but has shown little of the promise that those two thrillers showed .  each of those films had memorable characters and a tense plot .  they had almost nothing in the way of chases or gunplay .  the thrills all came from the plot .  ronin is like a film made by another man .  somewhere behind all the shooting and explosions and car chases there are the rudiments ofa plot , but we see only tiny pieces of it .  we get a clue here and one there as to what is going on but j . d . zeik's screenplay is a bit obscure .  the film begins explaining that a ronin is a masterless samurai .  when a samurai has failed in the job of protecting his master from death , he becomes a ronin , much like a gunfighter in the american west .  if you miss the opening , do not worry .  this film will explain again what a ronin is .  sam ( played by robert de niro ) is the modern equivalent of a ronin .  he is a free agent who seems to have really good instincts about how to stay alive the world of a professional killer .  he clearly was in a dangerous business at one time and now he seems to be drifting around on his own somewhere in france .  sam is recruited from a montmartre bar by dierdre ( natascha mcelhone of the truman show ) , an irish woman , to be part of an action to steal a mysterious metal case .  dierdre is very tight-lipped about what is in the case .  sam joins a team of four others : vincent ( jean reno of the professional/leon and mission impossible ) , spence ( sean bean , tv's richard sharpe , and also patriot games and goldeneye ) , and gregor ( stellan skarsgard of breaking the waves and good will hunting ) .  also along is larry ( skipp suddeth ) .  the group seems to know their business , particularly sam , but each is in his own way cold and professional with his own field of expertise .  their only human side seems to be in tensions among the members of the team .  the story is not very easy to follow .  it is never clear who is double-crossing whom and who is working for whom .  somehow russians ( who may or may not be the russian mafia ) and irish radicals are involved trying to get their hands on a certain metal case .  some very good actors are involved in this film .  one wonders what they saw in the script .  the characters are mostly one-dimensional professional killers .  they know their work , and seeing their thought patterns adds some interest to the film , but for this group deep feeling between two people is teaming up with another killer so that neither is killed .  by the end of the film we never really got to know anybody .  maybe that is the secret of why such good actors took parts , since these are not very demanding characters to create .  in addition to the above characters the film also features jonathan pryce and michael lonsdale ( the latter of moonraker and of the superior thriller the day of the jackal ) .  as a revival of a sort of action film that was popular in the 1960s , i was hoping that there would be something here to grab onto and enjoy .  unfortunately there are no deep characters , and little to make us care who eventually ends up with the metal case or why they want it .  i rate ronin a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  non-spoiler : incidentally , the tale of the 47 ronin has been filmed multiple times , usually under the title chushingura or as the 47 ronin .  also one frequently sees in japanese art the image of a man breaking down a door with a huge mallet .  this is the first blow of the 47 ronin .  |-0.13333333333333336|0.8000000000000002|0.6666666666666666|"The overall sentiment of the explanations leans slightly negative, as the author expresses disappointment in the film ""Ronin"" and criticizes its shallow characters, unclear plot, and questionable motivations of the actors.

0|"the main problem with martin lawrence's pet project , a thin line between love and hate , like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man , is that his character is an irresponsible jerk , and if that is the case , it doesn't seem to do anything except justify the woman's actions .  that is especially the case in lawrence's darnell wright .  he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long .  now don't think i condone this just because i'm male .  my philosophy is , if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful , kind girl , you should treat her like a princess and respect her .  darnell doesn't think like this .  he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them .  and by the period in the film he discovered that his newest target , beautiful , wealthy brandi web ( played nicely by whitfield ) who runs a successful real estate business , is out to kill him for dumping her for his childdhood friend mia ( king ) , i found myself thinking , "" i'm supposed to feel sorry for this guy ? ""  after all , it is largely darnell's fault .  if he is lining up all these women , you'd think he'd have enough common sense to think it would backfire on him one day , as his mother says it does .  but he doesn't , so you get the sense that he's not only irresponsible , but also pretty dumb .  you especially get this sense that he's dumb after brandi tells him she killed her husband for allegedly abusing her .   ( i'd put my pants on in two seconds after that ! )  now , brandi is a psycho bitch , but it's hard not to agree with what she says to darnell during the finale about guys like him treating her like garbage .  one final flaw , though , is letting brandi fall for darnell to begin with .  brandi is a classy , intelligent woman with an mba from harvard , who initally resists darnell's "" immature play "" as she calls it , as any woman like her would in real life .  but all of a sudden she says yes .  but when you listen to darnell's four letter word vocabulary watch his actions , you wonder why such an intelligent woman would fall for a guy like darnell period , much less have such an unhealthy obsession for him !  lawrence can be good when he wants to , but in order to prove it , he needs to let other people write and direct his movies .  look at this movie .  four writers , as a result it's too long ( two hours , when it could've easily worked at ninety minutes ! ) and it has a lot of subplots and characters that appear and disappear as quickly as they came ( which makes me think the writers didn't get along ) , all of which isn't necessary .  there are some bright spots , though .  whitfield , regina king , della reese , and bobby brown all do what they can with lazily written parts , and they help it out a lot .  and there are some funny parts ( like , for example , the scene where reese attempts to fight whitfeld for harrassing her son and damaging her property ) , but they're just not enough to sustain the film .

0|"capsule : lesbianism examined in the same hushed and reverential tones reserved for a terminal illness .  potentially interesting idea made stagy and boring .  claire of the moon is such an impossibly serious and sober movie that i was waiting for someone to sneeze , just to break the ice .  it's a perfect example of what my wife calls an s . f . e .  movie , where s . f . e .  means so f * * * ing earnest .  movies like this need wit and brashness to be absorbing .  claire is one strained speech after another , written delivered with all of the energy and spontenaity of a dmv clerk .  claire takes two women , claire and noel , both writers , and throws them together in the same cabin at a women-only writer's retreat .  claire wrights light comedy , while noel is a scholarly authority on porn and sexual behavior .  obviously , the two of them are going to have plenty to talk about , and for the entire one hundred and twelve insufferable minutes of this movie , that's all they do : talk .  the movie sets up its ( microscopic ) plot with beat-a-dead-horse-into-glue obviousness .  the evening talks at the camp are chaired by a motherly type named maggie , a self-professed lesbian , and when noel owns up to also being a lesbian , claire looks like she's been hit with a sockful of wet sand .  the movie then quickly degenerates into lots of scenes where noel glances at claire with significance , and claire looks out over the water reflectively .   ( ugh ! )  the most amazing thing about the movie is how people so intelligent can talk so much and yet get so little through their thick heads .  all of this , of course , leads up to a scene of complete inevitability : claire and noel , in a scene that should have come an hour earlier , because then the movie ends without even the benefit of reflection about what's just happened .  we never get a hint about how any of this has changed anyone , only how they felt about things that didn't even happen yet .  the problem with claire . . .  is not lesbianism as such , but the leaden way it's handled .  why is it that any "" serious "" ( a better word would be adult or at least thoughtful ) examination of sex in a movie almost always winds up producing a movie that's unwatchably boring ?  the way this movie deals with lesbianism , we might as well be watching an overheated docudrama about aids .  many other movies have used the same subject in ways that are a thousand times better -- more engaging , more creative , more intellectually and artistically interesting .  look at john sayles' lianna , or the interesting and little-seen desert bloom ; both of them have more life and vibrancy than claire .  what this movie needed was a good swift kick in the pants .

0|"the great actor james woods once said ( and i'm paraphrasing ) , "" if sex isn't messy , then you're not doing it right "" .  a truly profound statement , and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre ( just replace "" sex "" with "" your mad slasher film "" ) .  for those uninformed souls , the mad slasher genre ( or sub-genre ) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline : a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween .  urban legend is a mad slasher flick , but one that is so sanitary , bloodless , and nudity free , that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful ( though not overly talented ) cast , it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special .  for film makers , gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale , fright-free horror movie , as stephen king once said ( again paraphrasing ) "" if you can't scare your audience , gross em' out , if you can't do that , make em' laugh "" .  alas , urban legend succeeds only at the latter , though not by intention .  i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success ( $40 million domestic box office gross ) more frightening than anything in it .  it seems that audiences' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt .  the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills , but how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them .  unfortunately , these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations ; one idiotic super-hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films don't need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering .  if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin , wild wild west , and godzilla .  but forget all that , it goes without saying that mad slasher films ( or any other exploitation off-shoot ) will be made without an ounce of craft ( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced ) .  allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film : the lack of enthusiastic exploitation .  these flicks aren't harnessed with any lofty aspirations , so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good time ?  sadly out of the literally hundreds made , i would estimate that maybe three are at all worth while .  and urban legend would certainly not be included amongst those three .  despite its considerable production value and the absence of any boom mics slipping into frame , it is just as awful as any no budget entry in the slasher sweepstakes .  as far as the possibility of some good natured exploitation urban legend's setting alone offers a myriad of promising possibilities : it takes place on a college campus , which is always an appropriate playground for the crazed killer .  you see , the campus is a community made up almost entirely of young people all in the midst of strange hormonal surges percolating beneath the surface .  all those young people are growing up together , going through all kinds of inexplicable emotional highs and lows , so naturally some weirdness is expected .  all the better for that elusive crazed killer .  coupled with the copious amounts of scantily clad coeds running around , and the introduction of a little exploitation into the proceedings should be a relatively easy task .  but alas , urban legend is not only idiotic and clich ? ? full ; it's way too clean , a slasher flick for the whole family with no nudity , little gore , and much stupidity .  this is the kind of movie where the killer drags dead victims from the scene of the crime for no reason other than , i dunno , exercise .  it's the kind of movie where the villain calmly purses a running-like-the-wind-prey , yet still manages to catch that prey through some really awful editing techniques .  it's the kind of movie where characters run into each other just as a loud clash reverberates on the soundtrack .  i really wish filmmakers would just retire that whole loud-noise-jump-scare thing .  yes the audience jumps , momentarily frightened , but wouldn't anyone if a loud sonic boom suddenly infiltrated a quiet room .  i lost all hope for the possibility of any genuine scares in urban legend about ten minutes in when i caught a glimpse of the killer .  apparently filmmakers are running out of creative ways to disguise their mad slashers .  in scream it was a ghost mask ( scary enough ) , in i know what you did last summer it was a fisher man's rain slicker ( in the middle of summer no less ) , and in urban legend the disguise sinks to the level of mel brooks parody : the villain wears an oversized parka with a fury hood ( ooh ? ? ? scary ) intended to conceal his/her identity .  for urban legend 2 i humbly suggest a donald duck costume .  though i must admit , urban legend does have a winning premise for what could have been a somewhat entertaining exploitation film .  the film's killer slices and dices comely college students to the tune of famous urban legends ( you know , like the babysitter gets threatening phone calls only to find that they're coming from inside the house ) .  i won't spoil the surprise as to what urban legends are used , after all the film does offer fine 2 : 00 am cable viewing if you happen to be intoxicated enough .  sad to say , it doesn't include my favorite urban legend : a fairly graphic antidote concerning richard gere and a very unhappy gerbil .  now that would be scary .  before i leave you , i would like to bring to your attention the third most irritating thing about the film ( the first being the lack of craft , the second the lack of exploitation ) -- its characters , all of whom are just about the most annoying group of people i've ever spent an evening with .  only jared leto ( looking like a carbon copy of rob lowe from back in the day ) and alicia witt , as the resilient heroine , avoid vexatiousness .  the most annoying of the bunch is a tie between noxima girl rebecca gayheart and sitcom star michael rosenbaum , as a supremely irritating lout ( so irritating i actually cheered his painful death , and i am not a cruel person ) .  ironically those aggravating sacks of human waste provide the only entertainment in the film ; if viewed as a vicarious fantasy urban legend can be mildly entertaining .  after all this is a movie that features the kind of faux hipsters i can't stand getting slaughtered , which is at least better than watching an entire film about people i can't stand not getting slaughtered .

0|"a movie laced with a good blend of action , comedy , and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet , but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way , creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product .  eighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters , blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed , minus half of its original duo ( the late john belushi ) and nearly all of its original charm .  dan aykroyd reprises his role ( as well as his co-writing credit ) as elwood blues , the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self-proclaimed "" mission from god "" along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago .  as we begin , elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother's death in prison years ago .  completely on his own , elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood , only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away .  but elwood isn't completely without family .  it seems he has a half-brother of sorts - not a real brother mind you , just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo-father curtis ( cab calloway from the first film ) , who has also passed on .  despite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) to do otherwise , elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band .  working as a police commander , cabel chamberlain ( joe morton ) , has an immediate disliking for elwood , who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother's affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet .  following elwood around is the lonely orphan buster ( j .  evan bonifant ) , who quickly learns to become a mini-elwood .  when bartender mighty mack mcteer ( john goodman ) joins the group , the blues brothers band is complete , and once again , the group travels the country , crashing cars , blowing things up , and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock .  meanwhile , cab's personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next-to-next-of-kin .  >from this point , the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between .  those hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story .  only the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours .  for those people , it may be worth it , for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting , but when the story does intrude upon the festivities , the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes , musicians turned stiff actors , and the pointless 10-year- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing .  appearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin , james brown , eric clapton , and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film , but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors .  blues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really , really love this kind of music , you might kind of , sort of like this movie .  many , many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny , and if you don't have a passion for very deep blues/rock , you'll be bored out of your skull .  much of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd's self-serving vanity project , but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this , none of the excitement is passed on to the audience .  and seeing three guys in three-piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long .  unfortunately , those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film .

0|in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french-canadian co-production by max fischer .  the movie is set in paris where its hero , struggling american author david mirkine ( judd nelson , at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity ) suffers a terrible writers bloc .  he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle ( laurence treill ) .  unfortunately , she hangs out in jet set circles , which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous .  her connection with powerful david caravan ( pierce brosnan ) would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events .  although few pseudoerotic scenes and some elements of the plot do indeed make this film an erotic thriller , drama would probably be more appropriate genre label .  pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers , and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments .  low budget also becomes painfully visible , and physical attributes of laurence treill are the only thing worth watching in this film .  unfortunately , this film has too little of those supposedly erotic scenes , so those who wanted to watch erotic thriller have all the reasons to feel disappointed .  instead , they would have to settle with pointless , slow scenes involving nelson , brosnan and laurence treill's attempts of serious acting .  all of those definitely not worth spending hour and half of someone's precious time .  |-0.8000000000000002|0.9|0.8333333333333334|The film is criticized for being slow-paced, having a low budget, lacking expected erotic scenes, and disappointing viewers overall.

0|"in this re-make of the 1954 japanese monster film , godzilla is transformed into a "" jurassic park "" copy who swims from the south pacific to new york for no real reason and trashes the town .  although some of the destruction is entertaining for a while , it gets old fast .  the film often makes no sense ( a several-hundred foot tall beast hides in subway tunnels ) , sports second-rate effects ( the baby godzillas seem to be one computer effect multiplied on the screen ) , lame jokes ( mayor ebert and his assistant gene are never funny ) , horrendous acting ( even matthew broderick is dull ) and an unbelievable love story ( why would anyone want to get back together with maria pitillo's character ? ) .  there are other elements of the film that fall flat , but going on would just be a waste of good words .  only for die-hard creature feature fans , this might be fun if you could check your brain at the door .  i couldn't .

0|"when i first saw the preview for cruel intentions , i turned to my friend and said , "" dangerous liaisons for kids ! ""  it was clear to me that the film would be an obvious chunk of plagiarized nonsense , owing everything it is to stephen frears' 1988 masterpiece .  imagine my surprise to see that writer/director roger kumble has given credit to his source material : choderlos de laclos is recognized for his novel les liaisons dangereuses in the opening credits .  and i was impressed .  in fact , i was much more impressed with this recognition than with the actual film , which is an appalling excuse for a movie .  it's kiddie-porn hackwork , complete with earthy sex-talk and fully-clothed hand-jobs .  i suppose this kind of movie was inevitable ; with all the teen high-school angst movies coming out , there was certainly room for a pretentious and laughable movie about a bunch of teenagers who think they're smarter and more beautiful than all the other people on earth combined .  cruel intentions is a mess in every possible way , and it fails primarily in the way i expected it to : i hated all the characters , and i hate everything they do .  i also hate ryan phillippe , so perhaps my opinion is not as objective as it could be .  phillippe plays ( check out this name ) sebastian valmont .  wow .  isn't that a memorable name ?  i could just say it over and over again .  sebastian valmont .  it kind of rolls off the tongue , in the spirit of phrases like sanguine vapors and velvet sandwich .  sebastian valmont is the coolest guy who ever walked the earth ; there is no woman he can't have , no material object out of his reach .  he has all the money , all the sex -- all at his fingertips .  and , luckily , his parents never enter into his life -- no , in the world of cruel intentions , adults don't really exist .  the ones who do are irritating .  sebastian valmont lives with his stepsister , kathryn merteuil ( sarah michelle gellar ) , the bitch-queen of the universe , and also the woman every man wants .  since these two rich kids are so bored , they only thing they can do is challenge each other with meaningless sexual liaisons .  kathryn wants sebastian valmont to de-virginize cecile caldwell ( selma blair ) , a naive dork-chick who has somehow wronged kathryn .  but it's too easy for sebastian valmont -- he wants to nail annette hargrove ( reese witherspoon ) , the "" paradigm of chastity and beauty . ""  so , sebastian valmont and kathryn make a deal ( which is too explicit to state here ) .  but -- dear god !  -- sebastian valmont actually begins to fall for poor annette hargrove .  dangerous liaisons is a great movie because the characters are all believable , and because of its masterful acting .  cruel intentions is bad for many reasons , but it lacks both believable characters and masterful acting .  kathryn merteuil is simply a hateful witch , a girl so loathsome that i would probably enjoy pouring hot lead on her .  she is supposed to be mean , but glenn close gave the character some depth in dangerous liaisons .  gellar , while aesthetically pleasing , is one-dimensional and utterly repulsive .  witherspoon has a truly beautiful face , but her character isn't the moral staple she's supposed to be : sure , she won't have sex until she's in love ( is this really a * moral * issue ? ) , but she does some things in the last few scenes that are more than a little reprehensible .  but i can't forget mr . phillippe , who continues to exceed my expectations with his impenetrable , invulnerable blandness .  i have to give him credit and say that he did , in fact , manage to change his facial expression about three times during the course of cruel intentions .  and there's one point in the film in which he shouts , thereby defeating my hypothesis that he is vocally monotone .  true , he is bad , but it doesn't help that he has no character to work with .  kumble has drained all the interesting aspects from this character , leaving us with a sex-crazed lunatic who is supposed to be sympathetic because he falls in love with a moral flower and shuns the wicked bitch .  the film fails in every other way , too .  first of all , nobody talks like this .  even the "" intellectuals "" i know don't bother with this kind of pointless and pretentious yammering .  for a while , the movie looks like it might play itself for laughs , but it ends up taking itself so seriously that there's no way we can join it .  cruel intentions also manages to come off as soft-porn in more than one scene .  earlier i mentioned a fully-clothed hand-job ; this occurs between kathryn and sebastian valmont , both of whom are intended to be hateful at this point in the movie .  so , if we hate them , then what's the point of an extended sex scene ?  titillation , of course .  it can't even work under the pretense of "" meaningful love scene , "" because we hate the characters .  it's interesting to note some of the parallels between cruel intentions and dangerous liaisons .  kumble is clearly familiar with the earlier film ; many of the scenes have a similar tone , and there are moments in frears' film that kumble imitates almost completely ( such as the last scene , in which [spoiler warning ! ] the antagonist is humiliated in front of her peers ) .  but kids don't act like this .  nobody acts like this .  in his translation , roger kumble forgot character development and sympathy -- some pretty crucial elements .  the result is a picture of confounding badness , a kiddie-porn mess that thinks it's really deep and profound .  i'll give cruel intentions credit for realizing its influences , but that doesn't change the fact that it's awful .

0|everyone knows that old rule , 'never work with children and animals . '  in this latest horror flick mimic case , it's 'never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead , as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience .  the film begins in new york , where we see children dying from a mysterious disease , which is being carried by cockroaches .  dr . susan tyler ( sorvino ) creates a genetically enhanced bug ( the 'judas' breed ) , however , which is designed to kill all cockroaches .  the bug does it's job , the cockroaches all die , and the terror is gone .  'three years later' appears on the screen , and we discover that the judas breed is back , bigger than ever , and ready to kill .  the spin on this bug , however , is that it can mimic it's predator , and in this case . . . . it's  humans .  that should teach us for squishing all those bugs .  what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere , tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued , almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace .  perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking , and trying to avoid the 'predator' type movie it could easily have become .  if it is , then the director and writers have made the wrong move , because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest .  the director , who bought us cronos , a far superior film , directs the film in a calm , and frankly dull movie .  there are few exciting sequences , instead just a lot of people talking .  if the dialogue was intelligent , then it would be all right , but it's sadly babbling nonsense .  in fact , the script is embarrsingly weak , and the characterizations not much better . sorvino and company are as 2d as characters come , with the script not bothering to develop them .  there is some action in this film , but it's directed in such an annoying way , it's just infuriating to watch .  the camera cuts all over the place , disoreitating the audience , and instead of involving the audience in the action , it merely alienates them .  the peformances are o . k , if slightly below average .  sorvino is o . k , although she's not very good at conveying terror , or anything emotion really .  the supporting cast are all sterotypes , with characters such as a big black security guard with a foul mouth , a geeky scientist with spectacles , and what could be the most stereotypical mexican 'old timer' ever .  their reasonable good fun , however .  mimic , then , may fail with it's story , pacing and characters , but the film does look good .  like dark city , mimic is a definite case of style of content .  it may be a bit too gloomy for it's own good , but the sets look nice , and parts of the film are directed well .  but looks aren't good enough to save mimic from the depths of mediocre , somewhere where it shouldn't really belong .  a good opportunity , then , wasted .  a shame .  overall rating= review by david wilcock ? 1998  |-0.5|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|"The movie ""Mimic"" receives negative criticism for being boring, having weak characters, poorly directed action sequences, and a babbling nonsense script, although it is visually appealing in some parts.

0|"this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont's debut as a director , 1994 surprise hit speed .  but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead .  annie ( sandra bullock ) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again .  she's going on a cruise with her new boy-friend alex ( jason patric ) , and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger ( willem dafoe ) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line .  they sacked him after he got sick .  now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship's safe for compensation .  that actually is the whole storyline .  speed 2 could do without dialogues .  the movie is all about images and remarkable sound .  i don't really know why this is called an action movie .  except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies .  first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie .  then desaster strikes .  sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around .  i looked for the "" action "" but couldn't find it .  most of the time she is part of the decoration .  the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door .  now we know that she can handle a chain saw .  we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds .  the bomb defusal of course goes wrong , but only the furniture is damaged , not our heroes who still are needed .  jason patric alias alex spends most of his time flirting with annie , helping other passengers and frolicking in the water .  his initial sea-sickness is suddenly gone , because there are ship , crew and passengers to be saved from evil geiger .  he does a pretty good job but i can't blame keanu reeves for declining this part .  then there's willem dafoe , the villain , who desperately tries to look as frightening as frankenstein's monster .  he doesn't succeed , though .  an untidy appearance isn't enough to convince the viewer of his psychopath potential .  before he tries again to make us believe he is a dangerous man he should practise for a while in front of a mirror .  i can't really recommend speed 2 . you will probably like the movie if you like funny situations that aren't meant to be funny .  especially the showdown , when the ship first runs into an oil tanker and then dissembles a whole village is a treat .  there you get to see the most superfluous scene in the movie .  in keeping with last year's desaster movie tradition a dog is miraculously saved from certain death .  a really funny ( and meant to be funny ) scene takes place on the oil tanker right before the collision .  some crew members watch two ships colliding in an old movie .  had they looked out the window they wouldn't have missed the huge ship racing toward them .  those of you who still want to see the movie should pick a theater with a large screen and a good sound system to enjoy the visual effects and the phantastic surround sound effects .  in an adequately equipped theater it's as if the explosion were going off all around you and you can feel the seats vibrate .  but the ilm special effects can't save the movie .  for all the money they could have done better .

0|8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery .  nicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe .  the movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed .  all mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not .  welles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide .  although the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most .  the snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away .  8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven't seen from another standard thriller .  the cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage .  while he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . )  here , in 8mm , he's boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice .  and in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up .  only when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent .  his performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch .  catherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves .  her character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year .  also fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director .  as this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch .  unlike seven , 8mm isn't too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives .  lacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment .  but director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it's just not very disturbing .  schumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry , it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point .  also , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching .  8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed' opportunity .  with a boring lead character , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller .  ultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like .  and trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it .  |-0.6000000000000001|0.8666666666666667|0.7666666666666666|"The movie ""8mm"" is a disappointing thriller with a predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, and a director more focused on style than substance, resulting in a lack of shock value and missed opportunity.
