1|one of the best movies i've ever seen .  i'd heard extremely good things about this movie , and though the previews didn't really intrigue that much , it was a movie i'd been anticipating for a few months now .  for some reason i'm not sure of - this movie was not that big a sucess over in the u . s . it was a definite hit with the critics , but didn't exactly set any box office records .  after viewing this incredibly well directed , written and acted movie , i can't help but wonder - why ?  the strength of this film is it's gritty realism .  the main characters are all human with individual flaws , no stereo-type hollywood heroes .  you may not agree with many of their actions in the movie or their approach to life , but that is what makes it so real .  i had expected this movie to be more of a drama than a thriller , but i was mistaken .  even the interrogation scenes moved at such a pace so that it felt just as thrilling as any car chase .  and the ending . . . . . . whoa .  i've never seen a movie in my life where everyone in it acts brilliantly .  the three male leads - guy pearce , kevin spacey and russell crowe are all just terrific .  the 'best actor' oscar talk surrounding this film should have netted one of them a statue , but there is one problem there .  how could they have chosen between these three actors ?  there is no way i could look at this film and say one of them was better than the other two .  it's impossible .  kim bassinger's performance is also a revelation .  i'd never been a big fan of hers before and always thought she was , well . . . what's the word - a twinky ?  that impression has changed , as she complemented crowe and pearce perfectly .  the depth to the story and characters is truly astounding .  no cardboard characters here .  the plot is full of twists and turns and some very clever sequences .  pearce's interogation of three seperate suspects is nothing short of brilliant .  i really can't fault this movie at all .  i was so glad to see fellow australian's pearce and crowe star in such a breathtaking movie .  i had been very familiar with russell crowe beforehand from his many australian films , but had not seen much of guy pearce .  i intend to change this next time i visit the video store : )  |0.9003|0.9499999999999998|0.9|The explanations provided all express highly positive sentiments towards the movie, praising its direction, writing, and acting, as well as its gritty realism, compelling characters, and thrilling pace.

1|"this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989 .  whether it was the meddling of studio executives , or the work of writer/director james cameron himself , the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed .  the main problem was fairly simple : the film's climax was unworthy of its build-up .  someone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed , because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition .  now available on video , it seems timely to re-evaluate what , in its newly revamped state , is now a near-masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two , alien and close encounters of third kind .  the plot is thus .  we meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard-nosed lindsay ( mastrantonio ) and captained by her soon-to-be-divorced husband bud ( ed harris ) .  the rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u . s . nuclear submarine .  requiring a dive part-way down a three mile deep trench , three navy divers arrive to command the operation , led by the edgy lieutenant coffey ( biehn ) .  but a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they're dealing with , as she memorably puts it , "" aren't speaking russian "" .  meanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and , even worse , a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u . s . navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions .  this crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig , with the trigger-happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings-on around them .  the human drama is often riveting , with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron's aliens .  the stunts , hardware , special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding .  and so they should be : cameron's technical credentials are well established .  but what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss .  the abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects .  one is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay , a relationship at times touching , at others incredibly intense and volatile .  the second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film's end , when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war .  with the inclusion of these startling scenes , the story's climax is now given real weight .  why on earth were they left out of the original ?  this reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible .  so then , we have 25 minutes of additional footage that's turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent .  i say "" quite "" because some flaws do remain .  the most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new , some old - that may well have you reaching for the barf bag .  nonetheless , the abyss : special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron's greatest achievements , alongside aliens and terminator 2 . see it and be moved , gripped and spellbound .

1|i have a soft spot in my heart for pure , amoral sleaze .  i liked showgirls ( there , i said it ) .  i typically enjoy myself when sitting through that eszterhaz , sex-filled cinematic tabloid-ish trash .  wild things is the best sleazy film i've ever seen .  it's filled with great performances , graphic sex , three-way sex , rape charges , double-crosses , plot twists , genitalia of all genders , graphic violence , death , witty humor , and , best of all , denise richards .  criticizing this film for being disgusting , raucous , and just plain wrong is as fundamentally pointless as criticizing citizen kane for being disturbing , or titanic for being lofty and epic .  wild things is a film that succeeds in its endeavors , but i don't just admire it for this--i admire it for being so entertaining and such a fun time at the movies .  i must admit up-front , however , that i am directly in the center of the age group to which this film has been engineered to appeal .  i imagine that this shows .  it's hard to give a plot summary without giving away pieces that shouldn't be known .  i thought i had the whole thing worked out from the trailer , but i was wrong ; there are a lot of turns here .  i'll just say that the film takes place in blue bay , a rich little town in florida .  in blue bay lives sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a teacher who is accused of rape by two of his students , kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , and suzie toller ( neve campbell ) .  kelly's mother , sandra ( theresa russell ) , immediately presses charges .  all of this happens fairly early in the film .  and right up until this point , i had the whole film predicted .  i was wrong , though , and every time i was proven wrong , i was shocked .  wild things isn't even remotely plausible , but it is so fun to see where the story takes us that the implausibility of every scene is meaningless , and often invited , just for kicks .  i remember first seeing the preview for wild things before the replacement killers .  i'd give the preview four stars .  it made me want to see the movie so much that i've been waiting for it anxiously ever since .  over the past few weeks though , i started to realize that there was no way the film could live up to the preview ( see independence day ) ; thankfully , i was proven wrong .  the preview for this film is one that needs to be studied by marketing analysts of every distribution company : not only does it make us want to see the film , but it doesn't give away any of the secrets .  but i'm not here to talk about the preview .  i'm here to talk about denise richards .  now , i found her mildly interesting in starship troopers , but in wild things she appeals to such a base instinct that every scene she's in demands attention in a way that almost no other performer can .  of course , this might have something to do with her oceanic eyes . . . and  flawless body . . . but  i thought she did a great job acting , too ( stop laughing ) .  no , richards is truly a find--she is talented , and always convincing in this film .  this mixed in with her insane physical appeal makes her a vital asset to any film she may grace in the future .  the other actors are good , too .  dillon is as suave as ever ( it's nice to see him bouncing back from albino alligator and in & out ) .  bacon does a good job acting all determined and stuff as a sex crimes officer .  neve campbell gives the most layered performance of all of them , though i won't pretend that any of these characters are deep and complex .  for a plot like this to work , all of these people have to be insane and basically contrived .  that's okay , because director john mcnaughton knows that he's making a self-consciously wicked film .  each scene--even the three-way sex scene--is observed with hilarity by mcnaughton , and the result is a sleaze-fest that's too smart to resist .  there isn't an inconsistent moment in wild things : every bit of it is alluring garbage , so trashy it's funny , and so entertaining it's painful .  i loved it .  |0.32486666666666664|0.8583333333333334|0.85|The sentiment of the explanations is summarized as slightly positive/ mixed with mentions of enjoying the entertaining and fun nature but also acknowledging some negative aspects such as implausibility and trashiness.

[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture and seats]  title : `tarzan' beautiful to look at , easy to follow .  review : disney continues its trend of producing animated summer blockbuster movies meant mostly for children but with enough wit and charm for adults to be interested and at least entertained by the story .  the basic premise is the same as every other `tarzan' story : a boy is raised in the african jungle by gorillas and becomes one himself never really understanding ( or even noticing ) that he's human and is a lot different from the animals he befriends .  the first third of the film shows how tarzan comes to be adopted by kala ( voiced by glen close ) , a female gorilla who lost her own child in a classic case of darwanism .  her mate , kerchak ( henriksen ) , is a mean , conservative leader of the pack of gorillas who make up tarzan's extended family .  he refuses to acknowledge tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz during the childhood scenes ) as a son and often has to hold himself back from killing tarzan after he continually does dangerous , wild things that are the result of his own childish instincts .  i have a feeling children will quickly be able to identify with tarzan since all he really is is just a kid who wants to have fun and it's funny how the adults fail to comprehend this .  later , as the story transitions from tarzan as a child to a full-grown man ( voiced by goldwyn ) , he is encounter by a party of three humans from england : jane porter ( driver ) , a beautiful woman who is something of a zoologist and an artist , her father prof . archimedes q . porter ( voiced by nigel hawthorne ) who is also a scientist ; and their slick and cunning , yet barbaric safari bodyguard clayton ( blessed ) .  it's easy to tell where the story is going at all times but the screenplay doesn't seem like it was written hastily nor dumbed down for children's enjoyment .  sure there's a lot of cliche stuff here , like clayton's smugness and diabolical manipulation of tarzan and jane ; the goofy supporting characters ( voiced by rosie o'donnell [in full brooklyn accent ! ] and wayne knight - `hello newman ! ' ) .  there's also a lot of fun action such as tarzan's swinging through the jungle on vines and sliding down and around tree branches and trunks .  it's just like skateboarding really fast and doing all sorts of tricks ( those mcdonald's commercials really prove this point ) .  ultimately , you get exactly out of `tarzan' what you expect . . .  and i mean that as a compliment , so have high expectations .  pros : animation and sound are a feast for the senses , story is lighthearted , breezy and not dumbed-down , no stupid sing-along songs to get stuck in your head .  cons : surprisingly violent , should have been rated pg .  young children may not understand some of the more adult themes ( parents , be ready to have some heavy questions thrown your way ) .  running time is a bit short .  would you recommend this to friends ?  not to my friends , but to the movie-going public i would .  score : or with no 0 rating ) .  |0.6666666666666666|0.9|0.8333333333333334|The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive, with praise given to the animation, story, and entertainment value for both children and adults.

1|"i've always been told that there are two things in life that are unavoidable - death and taxes .  oddly , i've never given much thought to either of the two .  maybe if i did , at least i'd stop getting collection notices from uncle sam .  yes , let me make a resolution to devote myself to better record keeping , hold on to all my receipts , and to do what it takes to have the satisfaction that my returns are mistake-free and will keep me from incurring penalties .  it seems that the issue of death may not be so different , at least envisioned here in this film .  as this tender love story goes , if you do good things and have a clear conscience when you die , you ascend to a place of great peace and beauty .  the dreams , wishes , and fantasies that you had when you were alive come true .  for those who die with a burdened soul , however , they wind up in that other place .  chris and annie ( a winsome robin williams and a radiant annabella sciorra ) seem like the perfect couple that deserve all that heaven has to offer .  their love for each other is strong and their bond is undeniable .  but tragic events eventually tear apart the fabric of annie's happiness .  and when chris dies after a terrible car accident , she commits suicide - a tortured soul who blames herself .  despair is perhaps the greatest sin , and she will wallow in her guilt throughout eternity .  chris , on the other hand , has made it to heaven , and upon learning of annie's fate , he journeys to hell to find her and to try to free her from her nightmare .  this film brims with imagination , containing a lush imagery that shows the arcadia that is heaven and the bitterness and frightfulness that is hell .  it seems that heaven and hell could very well be a product of our fantasies or nightmares .  it's shape and look is as infinite as our imagination .  as chris explores his new fantastic world and discovers things both amazing and wondrous , he also begins to learn more about himself .  certain questions baffle him at first .  why does his home in heaven ooze with paint ?  what is the significance of the asian stewardess ?  why does he have an all-too-willing guide ( cuba gooding , jr . ) to help him find annie ?  but as he slowly begins to realize the answers , it makes him stronger and gives him a greater chance to save annie .   "" dreams "" is both visually and tellingly beautiful .  alas , i have one regret .  the movie did well to gather more and more emotional speed , but the denouement was curiously unsatisfying .  it seemed as if it was racing to some kind of great finish , but its intensity seemed to wane in its final moments .  however , your eyes will still well up with tears and you'll find lots to savor .  the storytelling is purposeful and well constructed .  the journey is imaginative .  and i was surprised by how much i enjoyed this film .

1|"it was a crazy time in france , what with the french revolution right around the corner .  king louis xv would soon die , and his son would become king louis xvi .  such is the setting for beaumarchais : the scoundrel about the controversial playwright , spy and playboy pierre-augustin caron de beaumarchais .  beaumarchais was the author of the plays , "" the barber of seville "" and "" the marriage of figaro . ""  today people think of them as quaint and harmless operas , but , back in 1773 when the movie takes place , they were so scandalous that beaumarchais was thrown into prison more than once .  the movie beaumarchais : the scoundrel takes a light-hearted approach to its subject , resulting in an inviting motion picture .  one of france's most expensive productions ever , the movie was a huge hit when it opened there last year .  now in theatrical release in the united states , it eschews the seriousness of most art house films with a romping good story .  the secret of the film's success , other than the lavishness of sylvie de segonzac's costumes , has to be the performance by fabrice luchini as beaumarchais .  with his glistening eyes and his infectious smile , he mesmerizes the camera and the audience .  his wry little lips seem always to hint at some unspoken deviousness he is planning .  in a land where court intrigue determines one's destiny , constant scheming was a way of life for the aristocracy .  as our story starts , we learn that beaumarchais has bought himself a judgeship .  into his court comes a member of the nobility demanding an immediate sword fight .  beaumarchais , who has been having an affair with the man's wife , makes him wait until the current case on the docket is decided .  that over with , the fight is on .  with luchini's charisma , it is hard to root for anyone other than him .  audiences may remember him from the marvelous colonel chabert , in which he played the attorney .  although he does not have half of the good looks of his assistant gudin , played by manuel blanc , he dazzles the women and the viewers with his grace and style .  michael epp's warm and intimate cinematography provides a nice accompaniment to jean-marc kerdelhue's lush but realistic looking sets .  jean-claude petit's music , especially the hauntingly lovely flute solos , make for an enchanting time at the movies .  director jean-claude brisville , who wrote the script along with edouard molinaro , fleshed out a play by sacha guitry which , according to the press notes , was just a series of historic vignettes .  the disorganization of the play still comes through at some points in the movie , but the actors smooth it over with their good-hearted style .  typical of the scenes that come out of nowhere is the one in which a rotund benjamin franklin appears in a large pot of hot water , taking his bath .  one episode has beaumarchais working with a renegade spy who may or may not be a man .  another has beaumarchais using his personal fortune to aid the american revolution .  all of this may sound like a dull historical drama , but it is anything but .  the story plays more like theater of the absurd than a movie based on historical facts .  the radiantly lovely sandrine kiberlain plays marie-therese , the real love of beaumarchais's life .  but he is so likable that members of the audience may want to compete with her for him .  still , with his beguiling smile , one can never quite be sure if you should trust him .  the movie , on the other hand , can be trusted to deliver a high old time .  beaumarchais : the scoundrel runs 1 : 41 .  it is in french with english subtitles .  the film is not rated but would be an r for some nudity and sex , and should be fine for most teenagers .

1|"what surprises me most about the long-awaited batman is that the movie centers not on the caped crusader but on the joker .  the dark knight actually has less screen time than his homicidal arch nemesis !  i can hear batfans everywhere protesting : "" first they had the nerve to cast michael keaton as batman , and now they think they can get away with making him second banana to the joker ! ! ""  and , indeed , this situation would have been altogether inappropriate and intolerable were it not for the fact that someone at warner brothers had the savvy to cast jack nicholson in the role he was born to play .  nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding , oscar-worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman .  nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown ( romero played the joker in the '60s tv series ) .  on one hand , nicholson's joker is extremely funny .  his murderous escapades and manic outbursts ( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts ) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film .  but on the other hand , his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind .  the joker's cruelty and demented , diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister .  this guy is off his rocker , and he not only knows it , he flaunts it !  but enough about nicholson as the joker : i'm sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman .  like many , i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader .  but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting !  keaton delivers .  he is convincing as the tormented millionaire , bruce wayne , and beneath his hard , black body armor , he is mysterious and formidable as the batman .  even though the screenplay only halfheartedly attempts to develop the character , keaton manages to give hints of the inner turmoil and emotional rage that drive wayne to don his bat gear and battle the low life scum of gotham city .  visually , batman is a knockout nothing short of a triumph for director tim burton and his production team .  the movie successfully captures the film noir look and bleak , gloomy atmosphere of such batman comic books as "" the dark knight returns "" and "" the killing joke . ""  burton's film is a feast for the eyes ; the $35 million budget is definitely on the screen .  the sets , costumes , and make-up are stunning and worthy of oscar nominations .  nicholson isn't joking when he boasts , "" wait 'till they get a load of me ! ""  his grimacing smile , green hair , and purple suits over orange shirts are colorful and outrageous .  keaton's wardrobe is equally appropriate .  batman's cape , mask , and body armor make him look threatening , frightening , and invincible bringing to mind not adam west's campy costume in the tv series but peter weir's outfit in robocop .  production designer anton furst's sets are a wonder .  gotham city is dark and foreboding , almost as if it were an expressionist vision of new york .  the batcave is cold , bare , and desolate .  the world that burton and furst have created in batman is a melancholy nightmare of violence and corruption .  the movie's gritty bladerunner/robocop look is a joy to behold .  the plot , on the other hand , is not as rousing .  the screenplay is not up to snuff in comparison to the stylized sets and superb acting .  it takes forever for what little story there is to finally kick into gear .  batman tries to walk a thin line between action and character psychology , but it fails to give us enough of either one .  as i mentioned earlier , the screenplay gives us plenty of the joker , but it never fully establishes batman's psychological motives and underpinnings .  in terms of action , batman is not as thrilling as you might expect .  burton seems more concerned with the visual and dramatic elements of the story .  more than anything , batman is a mood film .  while batman may not completely absorb and excite you , it will likely impress you with its success at bringing to life the style and spirit of the batman comic books .  thanks to its distinctive look , the movie like a good comic book transports us to another world .

1|"casting "" doogie howser "" star neil patrick harris as mind-reading military intelligence is only one of the guilty pleasures of "" starship troopers , "" a hugely entertaining , mega-budgeted sci-fi yarn directed by paul verhoeven , who's making quite a recovery from his 1995 g-string epic "" showgirls . ""  sure , "" starship troopers "" qualifies as cinematic junk food , but that's forgivable when the junk food is this tasty .  everyone needs a high-calorie change-of-pace from fall's onslaught of costume dramas and other assorted oscar bait , and "" troopers "" does the job admirably despite its flaws .  for its first hour , "" starship troopers "" plays like a cheeky futuristic hybrid of "" saved by the bell "" and "" g . i .  jane . ""  in the distant years ahead , high school grad johnny rico ( casper van dien ) signs up for federal service along with his girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; he gets accepted into the mobile infantry but she wants to travel to the fleet academy to become a starship pilot , so the couple is broken up .  but there's temptation awaiting both of them -- johnny's is in the form of an old friend ( dina meyer ) also in the infantry and still harboring a secret crush , while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor ( patrick muldoon ) .  personal rivalry and sexual jealousy carry over into the final 65 minutes , when an impending alien menace begins making good on its threatening presence and obliterates part of south america , killing johnny's parents and destroying his home .  our weakening , lovesick protagonist is given new reasons to stick around the mobile infantry , and is dispatched with a group of fellow fighters to the aliens' home planet , where he will head up a ground assault to end the threat for good .  but the enemy is far smarter , more diabolical and numerous than the good guys give them credit for , and after an initial walloping , they must re-examine their strategy .  the exposition -- played like a futuristic soap opera -- is silly , but aware of its own ridiculousness enough to merit more smiles than groans .  once we get past the campy character introductions and the numerous ( but never boring ) training sessions , "" starship troopers "" really kicks into high gear .  its last half is all gruesomely violent action -- a fury of severed limbs , decapitations , disembowelments , brain removal , explosions and other jolt-inducers that are really going to please the 13- and 14-year-old boys lucky enough to dodge getting carded or caught on their way into this deservedly r-rated show .  the creature design and special effects are amazing as expected , and their interaction with the human actors are a realistic , imaginative high point .  it's nice to see intergalactic beasties that aren't too derivative of the titular menace from "" alien . ""  these monsters are appropriately terrifying sights , especially the arachnids , a spider-scorpion-crab combo that's all sharp talons and even sharper legs .  they attack in packs of hundreds , and it's a funny , scary sight to see these bugs take repeated hits and still crawl , jerk and struggle towards their intended victims in a determined , gooey mess .  it matters not that they actually have a laughable master plan in mind ( ask yourself if a species like this seems capable of carrying out such a plot ) ; these sequences of insect warfare are numerous , bloody and immensely satisfying .  the occasional dramatic moments -- one cast member's death , the final resolution to johnny's love triangle -- are botched , a testament to how "" starship troopers "" fails to create any strong , outstanding characters .  these bland ken-and-barbie archetypes serve the story adequately enough to keep any distractions at arm's length , but restrain the film from achieving a higher ground a la "" star wars , "" where even the slightest aliens had definite personality .  the acting is decent ( but never spectacular ) ; most of the performers hail from aaron spelling territory -- smallish roles on "" beverly hills 90210 "" and/or "" melrose place "" -- and it occasionally shows .  van dien , for example , is limited but perfectly likeable .  in smaller parts are the afore-mentioned neil patrick harris as johnny's best friend and jake busey ( gary's son ) as johnny's sidekick ; the latter excels at playing creeps ( see "" the frighteners "" or "" contact "" ) but seems off-kilter as a second banana .   "" starship troopers "" is based on the novel by robert heinlein , a sci-fi writer who hasn't exactly seen any recent adaptation justice done to any of his books what with 1994's howler "" the puppet masters . ""  but the overall familiarity to the "" alien "" trilogy -- and the promise of great gobs of gore -- could act as a crowd-drawer .  its own possible influence , however , might well work against it when the franchise continuation "" alien : resurrection "" opens in a few weeks .  we will know then which film to crown as the best summer movie of the fall .

1|"historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s .  for many critics , scholars and , most importantly , film producers , it was a thing of the past - something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black-and-white television and non-cgi special effects .  but in 1995 , same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago , there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor , producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre .  and , same as in the case of dances with wolves , he was awarded for his effort with "" oscars "" .  the name of the film was braveheart , and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson .  the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace ( 1272 - 1305 ) .  in his time , english king edward i "" longshanks "" ( played by patrick mcgoohan ) has almost completely subdued entire british isles , including scotland , whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by "" ius primae noctis "" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights .  although english had killed his father many years ago , young scottish commoner william wallace ( played by mel gibson ) doesn't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron ( played by catherine maccormack ) .  murron's death changes that and wallace takes arms and , together with small but dedicated band of followers , begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country .  through time , more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace's rag-tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge .  but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves , especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce ( played by angus macfadyen ) , who wouldn't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader .  braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson , so it wouldn't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann .  however , even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre .  the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism .  while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale-like vision of picturesque castles , splendid costumes and knights in shining armour , gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice where might made right and life was hard , short and brutish .  this general unpleasantness is especially underlined in the scenes of battle , where hand-to-hand combat is naturalistically displayed in all its gory details , never seen since verhoeven's ultra-naturalistic flesh & blood .  compared with this naturalistic approach , most of old hollywood epics look like stage plays .  braveheart also employs humour at the right places , not only to make bloody realities of medieval british isles more bearable to sensitive audiences , but also to underline its down-to-earth atmosphere , so different from previous historical epics .  what makes braveheart "" larger than life "" is his protagonist .  mel gibson obviously invested plenty of his energy and talent in bringing the mythical figure of william wallace and , as a result , character of 15th century poems is transformed into superhuman being that resembles late 20th century comic book hero .  wallace is more than superior to his enemies , both physically and mentally , yet he is able to show his sensitive , more vulnerable side .  naturally , when the character is based on epic poems , most of historical accuracy is going down the drain ( which was the case with almost every historical epic from hollywood in 1990s ) .  however , even those who don't particularly care about history or are willing to give poetic license to scriptwriter randall wallace might think that he went over the top in idolising wallace , especially in the second part of film when scottish superhero manages to seduce princess isabel ( played by sophie marceau ) and make her a child .  because of that the disbelief is hardly suspended , and final scenes aren't as effective as they should be .  mel gibson as an actor is truly wonderful , and he is also helped by small army of very good british and irish actors .  most memorable of them all is patrick mcgoohan , whose cold , calculated and evil medieval monarch is one of the most effective villains seen in contemporary cinema .  brendan gleeson ( who would later become famous for his role in boorman's general ) is also very good as wallace's trusted companion , as well as ian bannen is effective as leprosy-stricken king john balliol .  david o'harra is very entertaining as wallace's irish ally , and angus macfadyen brings a lot of anxiety into his conscience-stricken character of robert the bruce .  women in this film have rather thankless roles , especially marceau as one-dimensional french princess .  catherine mccormack as wallace's wife was more interesting , but she was eliminated from the picture early on .  from the technical point of view , the film is also very good .  photography by john toll brings a lot of scottish natural beauty to the screen .  on the other hand , the musical score by james horner employs too much of modern-day instruments for period piece set in medieval times .  although mostly welcomed by critics and audiences alike , braveheart was often criticised for homophobia and other forms of extreme conservatism .  the main reason for that was the fact that gibson , among many historical facts , chose to be faithful only to those related to sexual orientation of "" longshank "" 's son prince edward ( played by peter hanly ) .  he is not only presented as a villain , but also as one of the less competent in villain's camp - and portraying of homosexuals as villains or inferior to heterosexuals is almost unforgivable sin in "" politically correct "" hollywood .  to make things even more obvious , good guys in this film are the total opposite of effeminate and incompetent edward - rugged macho men of mountains who are more practical and efficient because they tend to employ conservatives' common sense instead of fashionable theories of ivory tower liberals .  however , although the message of this film might look right-wing , it owes more to leftist ideology of various national liberation movements in 20th century .  according to that ideology , oppressed classes ( workers , peasants ) are better suited to fight for national freedom because their members has less to lose in that struggle and , as such , they are more radical , less willing to make compromises and more efficient ; on the other hand , privileged classes ( aristocracy , bourgeoisie ) are more likely to betray the cause of freedom and be in cahoots with foreign oppressors in order to keep their privileges .  this marxist worldview is presented in braveheart without any subtlety .  in the end , whether the audience is patient enough to discover hidden meanings or simply wants to enjoy entertaining historical epic , braveheart is more than adequate choice for all fans of this recently resurrected genre .

1|"if you had a chance to create a genetically perfect child , would you do it ?   "" gattaca "" is a film which presents a future where society has answered "" yes "" to this question , but then ponders if this was actually the right decision .   "" gattaca "" came out only a couple months following the first genetically engineered creature , the lovable dolly the sheep , and with this in mind , the film only becomes more frightening .  the way the realm of genetics is heading , it may only take a couple decades until the future "" gattaca "" presents becomes true .  contrary to the misleading trailers , "" gattaca "" is not a sci-fi thriller , in the way that there's lots of murder , hitchcockian suspense , and chase scenes .  this is a quiet , sad film about intelligent theories .  in fact , the film seems like it would have been written by george orwell or aldous huxley ( the latter who's novel "" brave new world "" featured genetically engineered children ) .  it's a film that may likely become a cult hit to people who are frightened by a promise of shallow utopia , which is exactly what "" gattaca "" presents . . . and the main reason i dug it so much .  the story revolves around the genetically insufficient vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) , a man with high hopes but a 90% chance of heart problems , and a prospected life span of around 30 years .  as a child , he was put down because of the threats of genetics , while his younger genetically perfect brother , anton ( loren dean ) , was promised whatever his heart desired .  vincent yearns to be an astronaut , but when he gets a job at a giant space company , it's as a janitor ( ernest borgnine plays his boss ! ) .  but one day , he finds out that it's probably possible that his desires can come true in the form of a business deal brought out by a black market geneticist ( or something ) , german ( "" wings "" ' tony shalhoub , who did like hundreds of cameos in films back in '97 : "" men in black , "" "" a life less ordinary "" . . . ) , who's client is a genetically perfect man , jerome morrow ( jude law ) , who has unfortunately been crippled .  fortunately , though , there's no record of the accident , and he's willing to give someone else his life .  since vincent looks a bit like him . . .  after a couple alterations ( some minor , some really major ) , he has donned the life of jerome , and is doing his job .  there , he meets a genetically imperfect woman , irene ( uma thurman , who's genetically perfect in real life anyway , hee hee ) , and the two begin a kind of relationship , albeit a very shallow one since romance is deemed by how great a man's stats are .  however , a murder of a high-level worker at his office is killed , and one of vincent/jerome's eyelashes is found by the anal retentive investigators headed by a semi-wily inspector , hugo , ( alan arkin ) , and none other than vincent's long lost brother , anton , who hasn't seen him since they were teenagers .  we know vincent/jerome didn't do it , but with his older picture being posted everywhere , not only vincent/jerome's in trouble , but also the real jerome , who's as much in it as he is .  however , there isn't many big suspense set pieces , which is actually a blessing because if they were tossed in , the film would lose it's message and descend into just being a sci-fi thriller a la william gibson .  the suspense in the film comes from the idea that vincent and jerome can easily be captured just by dropping a hair or dead skin .  while there are several scenes which are pretty frightening , there are no big distractions from the point of the film , much to the dismay of commercial audiences .  what is actually portrayed is the lack of life in the utopian society that is created .  irene has no real spunk in her life , and is rather amazed by the sheer beauty of a sunrise rather than genetically perfect people .  and the genetically flawless jerome is in actuality a bitter man , claiming that his accident was really no accident .  what jerome has done is fool the system in giving a man who yearns for better things a chance at that , and the ending is shocking as it's a definite work of dystopian propaganda , but doesn't have the down ending of other works of this kind .  the production design of this film is probably the best i've seen this year : it's stunning , very pleasing to the eye , but still very cold .  since genetics has ruled out any chance of improvement , the world has cooled into a state of inhumanity , and the sets echo a sense of shallow misery .  and the sequence of all the high-level workers doing their jobs has a kind of gilliam-esque feel to it , showing the nightmare of slipping into a routine zombie-like life .  the ability to perfect people has left humanity cold and generally unhappy .  the acting from everyone is great , with thurman giving a wonderfully cold performance , and hawke creating a character who has been beaten down by the system but has found a new sense of optimism by a bitter man who was willing to give it out anyway ( interesting pointless fact : uma and ethan started dating after this film , and currently she is pregnant with his child ) .  but the best performance belongs to jude law , who steals every scene he's in , and creates a character filled with the pessimism over having such a horrible burden placed on his burden .  i think that people are generally tempted by the fact that genetics can actually create perfection in a child , but whether or not they would actually act on this temptation is something i'm not sure of .   "" gattaca "" warns us not to go any farther , chiefly because we'll create a world of elitism where the elite are shallow and unhappy , and as bitter and angry as the lesser people are .  and when i see a possible future featuring a 12-fingered piano player , well folks , that just creeps me out .

1|"in one scene from "" the people vs .  larry flynt , "" the hustler magazine publisher appears at a self-staged free speech rally .  as graphic photos flash on a huge screen behind him , flynt strides confidently across the stage , delivering a rousing speech over what really constitutes obscenity .  the spectacle was reminiscent of the scene in "" patton "" where the general spoke in front of a giant american flag .  both scenes were stirring , larger than life , richly entertaining , and felt totally like contrived set pieces for big hollywood movies .  overall , that sums up "" the people vs .  larry flynt . ""  the film is a wildly entertaining hoot which , despite being based on fact , feels like a big , phony hollywood movie .  the son of a kentucky moonshiner , flynt ( woody harrelson ) ran away from home and ended up operating strip clubs in cincinnati .  there he met althea leasure ( courtney love ) , a bisexual stripper who became his fourth wife and the love of his life .  to bolster interest in his clubs , he started a sexually explicit newsletter that grew into hustler magazine .  flynt , along with the magazine's rag-tag management team , headed by his brother jimmy ( played nicely by woody's real-life brother , steak & shake commercial veteran brett harrelson ) , viewed playboy magazine with contempt .  they mocked its slick articles and airbrushed photos , striving to keep hustler focused on "" what guys really want , "" explicit photos that would make a gynecologist squirm , and extremely crude humor .  the film's prime example of hustler's attitude is a cartoon depicting characters from the wizard of oz in an orgy , giving the audience an opportunity to giggle at flynt's "" naughtiness . ""  director milos forman conveniently ignores the magazine's frequent attempts to derive humor from child molestation , racism , and endless scatological cartoons .  flynt's rag labored in well-deserved obscurity until he published nude photos of jacqueline onassis , which brought the magazine international attention , big money and the attention of conservatives .  an obscenity bust followed , the first in a long series of battles between flynt and the law .  lawyer alan isaacman ( edward norton ) enters the scene , hired by flynt's wife .  norton , an exceptional actor , is wonderful as the beleaguered lawyer trying to navigate the legal system while dealing with flynt's increasingly childish and bizarre behavior .  in court , we meet the sputtering conservatives , headed by citizens for decency leader charles keating ( james cromwell . )  as keating blathers about flynt's immorality , the camera slowly moves in for a close-up of his name tag , inviting the audience to gloat at the notion of morality being trumpeted by keating , who was later convicted in a $2 billion s&l fraud .  flynt's other prime foe is rev . jerry falwell , who sues over a hustler parody involving him and his mother having sex in an outhouse .  tragedy strikes as flynt is shot by a would-be assassin , leaving him paralyzed from the waist down .  a dark period follows , as flynt and leasure hole up in an l . a . suite , strung out on pain killers .  flynt eventually kicks drugs , but leasure succumbs to addiction , and later , aids .  after watch falwell on tv , describing aids as a punishment from god , flynt directs his lawyer to take the falwell case to the supreme court , leading to the film's climactic courtroom scene .   "" the people vs , larry flynt "" is at its weakest when moralizing on free speech and lionizing flynt .   "" if they'll protect a scumbag like me , then they'll protect all of you , "" declared flynt .  he's right , of course , but the director forman cheats in portraying the opposition as little more than hypocritical buffoons .  he also cheats in casting woody harrelson as flynt .  harrelson is an attractive , charismatic man , and his strong performance paints flynt as a colorful folk hero .  even a cursory look at the real flynt , who is making the talk show circuit , and plays the judge in an early courtroom scene , shows a bloated , morose and bitter man .  an accurate portrayal of flynt would have made a more difficult film to watch , but a richer one .  despite its flaws , "" flynt "" is a fast moving , rousing movie with some terrific acting , especially by courtney love , whose vibrant performance will likely garner an oscar nod .  the story may be candy-coated , but it's still delicious candy .

1|"we all know the fate of "" child's play , "" which is the same for almost any film these days that does marginally well financially : sequel hell .  with the newest installment in the quasi-popular series currently out ( that would be "" bride of chucky "" - and it grossed 11 million in its opening weekend , which i think is the sign of the apocalypse number five ) , it's kinda fun to go back and see how it all began rougly ten years ago with the original , a task which is a retread for some , and for others ( namely myself ) a chance to see what all the fuss was about .  alas , the original "" child's play "" actually isn't that bad .  even seeing it in the tiny , claustrophobic , and mechanically-challenged theatre at my college wasn't the horribly dull experience i thought it would be , not just because of the nicely rowdy crowd ( which you almost need to watch a film like this - and if you don't believe me , try and watch this flick by yourself one day ) , but because as a whole , this isn't a bad movie .  it's not great , but it does have two things that many horror films like this one don't have : 1 ) a rather nifty premise , and 2 ) a sense of humor , both which save this from horror hell , which is precisely where , say , "" i know what you did last summer "" has recently gone .  the premise of "" child's play "" is that a serial killer named charles lee ray ( brad douriff ) is shot and almost killed by a chicago hard-boiled detective ( chris surrandon - see what happens to some oscar nominees ? ) , and before he dies , utters a voodoo chant that sends his soul directly into a kid's doll called chucky , a doll which has got to be the scariest-looking kid's doll i've ever seen .  the next day , a bum who's stolen it sells it to single-mother karen barclay ( catherine hicks ) , who then gives it to her young son andy ( alex vincent ) for his birthday .  of course chucky begins talking to the kid and trying to find a way to get out of the doll , but certain twists come up .  like the guy he learned voodoo from reveals to him that the only way to break the curse is to take over the body of the first person he told he was inside the doll , that being andy .  and soon enough , chucky is killing people either for revenge or for what seems like fun , and people are discovering that chucky isn't just a kiddie doll one by one .  the idea is a neat one , ripe for lots of comic terror , and luckily it utlizes a lot of that .  it plays with an idea stolen from a classic looney toons short that when someone knows that chucky is alive , they tell people about it , but when he tries to prove themselves , chucky does nothing , and everyone thinks they're crazy .  it plays with this , as well as the whole child-like thought that dolls and toys come to life , and even manages to cram in a couple really frightening moments .  even if there's an entire sequence devoted to cliches ( a woman alone in a house hears a noise , goes to investigate it , and finds nothing , but wait for the kicker a second later ! ) ,  there's also a harrowing car ride with chucky trying to knife the detective from the back seat , and then trying to attack him when the car finally crashes , leaving the viewer with at least rather visceral exprience .  the ending is rather fun , as well , albeit a tad too drawn-out ( about four different endings , maybe five ) , and the characters are more intelligent than the average horror film line-up , making them easier to sympathize with .  if there's one horrible thing about many horror films , it's that the protagonists are morons who you can't help but shout obscenities at , and for the most part , "" child's play "" steers away from that .  and most of all , the chucky character is a good one , not just because he provides instant comic relief ( look !  that doll's moving on its own ! ) , but because he's a generally scary character .  if there's anything really wrong with "" child's play , "" it's that it's too trite and has too less self esteem .  at almost 90 minutes , "" child's play "" features way too less to be a real classic of horror .  it throws itself into a simple three act set-up that renders it quick and almost forgettable if it weren't for the fact that the film deals with a psychotic doll .  if the film had more confidence in what it was presenting , it would really push the envelope and become even more than just a short bit of horror escapism , which is precisely why this kind of film is only memorable as a cheap little horor film . . . which  isn't necessarily a bad thing .  as such , "" child's play "" is content to be just the short , typical horror film , but saves itself via a sense of humor and a nice quasi-campy feel that makes it much more enjoyable than the average short , typical horror film .

1|"natural born killers is really a very simple story that , in essence , has already been told in bonnie & clyde with some major variations in emphasis , mood and degree .  both films glamorize "" outlaws , "" in one case bank robbers and killers and in the other mass murderers .  both relate the story of a couple liberated by love .  but where bonnie & clyde was partial and subtle , natural born killers is total and blatant .  where bonnie & clyde was social , natural born killers is psychological .  what bonnie & clyde hinted at , natural born killers confronts and explores .  what bonnie and clyde stole , mickey and mallory kill .  to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them , expressed metaphorically as killing , subdues the mysterious power this film wields .  for the most part , when mickey and mallory kill , they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily , they kill what is trying to kill them , they kill what dissembles and cowers from life , they kill what needs to be killed .  this mythos is at least as old as the hindu trinity .  brahma created .  vishnu preserved .  and siva destroyed , but he destroyed what needed to be destroyed to make way for the useful creations of brahma .  the following may be painfully mundane but metaphorically so accurate , i'm forced to say it for clarity's sake : a plumber must remove the old lead and copper pipes , that is , destroy the old plumbing system in order to replace it with the new one made of plastics .  your plumber , bonnie and clyde , mickey and mallory , and siva are all productive destroyers .  i think you could say without much of a challenge that religion is responsible for more killing and death , presently and historically , than any other phenomena .  muslims kill christians .  hindus kill muslims .  christians kill pagans .  jews kill christians , etc . you could reverse subject and predicate in each instance and still not be challenged .  religion is an orgy of killing .  the institution of the state only misses first place for technical reasons like it hasn't been a major player for as long or the two are frequently indistinguishable .   "" the state is the divine idea upon earth , "" hegel said , meaning it is absolute , all-powerful , ineffable , unassailable , infallible , authoritarian and patriarchal just like jhvh , allah , god , etc .  well , what does all this have to do with natural born killers ?  let me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex .  consider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever .  god takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other .  during the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power .   ( parenthetically , witness plato as well .  in the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime .  not coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . )  catholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil .  it sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure .  masturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution .  this is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence .  as further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters .  our culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years .  we can't help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self .  mickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves .  it is a straightforward liberation through sex .  as some good patriarch once observed , "" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . ""  m&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions .  they saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions .   "" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , "" as mickey says .  as a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face .  we are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is .   "" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans "" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us .  beyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . .  we have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth .  who else has found it ? --the  man of today ? -- "" i  don't know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn't know either the way out or the way in "" --so sighs the man of today . . . .  this is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay .  this tolerance and largeur of the heart that "" forgives "" everything because it "" understands "" everything is a sirocco to us .  rather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds !  as far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say .  its alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure .  for example wayne gayle's first report ends with some gen x dude saying , "" if i were a mass murderer i'd be mickey and mallory , "" in his most excellent bill and ted voice .  on one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes .  it seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he'd be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it .  let me exemplify what i've been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her "" the worst fuckin' head i've ever had in my life ! ! ! ""  now , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn't , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this .  sometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever .  it's no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey .  as the attendant approached he took on mickey's character in the eyes of mallory .  she needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory .  upon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else .  the style of the movie is a whole 'nother matter that i won't get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power .  let me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle .  the rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood .  also , jungian archetypes abound .  these can't help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames .  some of the best scenes and lines that come to mind . ( quotes are paraphrased only ) :  mickey to mallory : "" one of these days i'm gonna be cummin' for you , "" in prison , while mallory jacks mickey off .  semen is a symbol for great potential and things to come .  at the time they haven't yet had sex nor have they killed anyone yet .  the two of course go hand in hand .  for an even more explicit semen scene see silence of the lambs .  mickey during his marriage to mallory : "" as creator of my universe , i pronounce us man and wife .

1|"john sayles' "" men with guns "" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power .  the film takes place in an unnamed central american country , where the men with guns are the rulers .  most of the country is divided into tiny segments - some are controlled by guerrillas with guns , some are controlled by army soldiers with guns , and all the spaces in-between are controlled by thieves , bandits , and terrorists .  all people not fitting one of those descriptions are defined only by their powerlessness .  however , like so many central american countries , this one also features modernity .  there is an unnamed capital city that bears all the hallmarks of contemporary civilization : skyscrapers , hospitals , televisions , highways , etc . but , it might as well be in another country because those who live in the comforts of the city have either decided to ignore the violence ravaging the rest of the land , or else they are simply ignorant of it .  the film's main character , dr . fuentes ( federico luppi ) falls into the latter category .  one of his patients , an army general , describes him as the most educated man he has ever met , and also the most naive .  fuentes is a true liberal , a caring man who thinks he can cure the ills of his country by fighting bacteria and ignorance among the indigenous indians .  with government assistance , he has trained a large group of eager young medical students and sent them into the rainforest to cure and educate .  this program was to be his legacy , and he repeats over and over that it was a good idea .  however , when he ventures into that same rainforest to visit his prot ? g ? s , he finds that things have not turned out as he has envisioned .  as he travels deeper into the forest , going from village to village , the story is always the same : the doctors were all killed by either the guerrillas or the army soldiers , usually for helping the other .  when dr . fuentes asks a village woman why the army killed one of the doctors , she replies simply , "" because they had guns , and we didn't . ""  rational science and all its attempts to cure have been wiped out by the men with guns , because others' sickness and ignorance helps them maintain power .  dr . fuentes picks up several companions during his journey , all of whom are characterized by their loss .  first , there is a young boy named conejo ( dan rivera gonz ? lez ) , who has neither a mother nor a father .  next , fuentes crosses paths with a thief named domingo ( dami ? n delgado ) , who deserted the army because he was tired of being jeered into committing murderous atrocities .  through his ordeal in the army , domingo has lost most of his self-respect , and defines himself only by his pistol .  along the way , the group also picks up padre portillo ( dami ? n alc ? zar ) , a priest who has lost his faith .  as domingo is running from the army , so is portillo - he has been labeled a guerrilla sympathizer , and ran away from the village in which he was preaching .  last , the group takes on a mute girl named graciela ( tania cruz ) , who hasn't spoken since she was raped two years earlier , her innocence and even her will to live forcefully taken from her .  sayles two major strengths as a director - characters and setting - are abundantly evident in "" men with guns . ""   ( like many of his films , sayles might have tightened this one somewhat in the editing room , but a longer-than-necessary running time is a sin almost always committed when the director is also the editor . )  he creates fascinating , complex characters , especially dr . fuentes and domingo .  their uneasy relationship is also somewhat humorous in context of the film's overarching theme of violence as power - domingo's attempts to control fuentes with his revolver are constantly undermined by fuentes' belief that the revolver is unloaded ( at first it is , but later is isn't ) .  the setting is also as thick with detail as the rainforest itself .  sayles knows how to bring a location to life , whether it be an early twentieth-century coal mining town in "" matewan "" ( 1987 ) or a contemporary texas/mexico bordertown in "" lone star "" ( 1996 ) .  sayles is not a particularly inventive director - he likes to let his actors do most of the work - but he and cinematographer slavomir idziak ( "" gattaca "" ) successfully evoke both the beauty and the danger of the central american terrain .  sayles also maintains a strong sense of authenticity by filming everything on location in mexico , using all latin american actors , and having all the dialogue spoken in either spanish or native indian dialects .  the one exception is a couple of bumbling american tourists who work not only as comic relief , but as evidence of just how clueless the united states is about what is going on a few hundred miles south of the texas border .  it would not be a stretch to say that "" men with guns "" is a depressing film .  in fact , the two feelings it evokes most are hopelessness and failure .  in addition to loss , the main characters are also failures at something , whether that be dr . fuentes failure to change anything through medicine , or padre portillo's inability to stand up and be the martyr he always dreamed of being .  nevertheless , it is bleak material sayles has chosen , and he deals with it accordingly .  the last shot of the film does offer a hint of hope , even in a world where , as one character puts it , "" nobody refuses the men with guns .

1|"plot : during a 10-week span in london in the fall of 1888 , jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never uncovered , committed five ritualistic , grisly murders of prostitutes .  this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century-old mystery .  critique : awesome !  i love dark movies , i love stylish movies , i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp . . . so  yes , i really dug this movie !  the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance , out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously , and this movie , my friends . . . is  very serious !  in fact , it's also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell .  it ain't for the kids , i'll tell you that much .  and if any of those recent hack directors of two-bit scream-esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective "" kill scenes "" , do not look any further , because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner , especially when compared to their generic slice-and-dice contrivances .  in fact , most of this film's structure is very creative , the actors , all solid , the atmosphere and "" feel "" of the picture , remarkably real ( gotta love those "" unfortunates "" ) , and the descent into darkness , well honed by the filmmakers .  you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time .  but it's also an impressive mystery film , based on the true-life tale of jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never discovered .  the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel "" from hell "" written by alan moore and presents a compelling story , which despite being a little oliver stone-ish , did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely , and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem , sexual depravity , drug usage , insanity , murders and love ?  yes , the brothers even managed to slip a little "" love "" story in here , and despite not truly being developed , i guess it could've been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already .  that's right , there's no real need to put any "" romance "" in a film about a mass murderer !  but that aside , you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp , who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities , to center this movie all the way through .  sure , he's just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow , but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one .  i was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film ( i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie , but she was fine ) and how little the dreams/fantasies of depp's character had to do with the film's development ( from what i had seen in the trailer , i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story , but thankfully , it wasn't ) .  on the downside , the film doesn't really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development .  but then again , a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all-time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement .  i mean , the less i knew about each person , the more suspicious i became of each one's motives , reasons , etc . . .  in fact , i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end , and that was in part , due to the distance to which i'd been held from the film's characters . . . or  am i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention ?  perhaps .  overall , this is an extremely creepy production , with glorious cinematography ( reminiscent of coppola's dracula and burton's sleepy hollow ) , a grim score and solid acting .  but it's not for everyone .  some may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events , and even though the murders aren't shown as graphically as you might think , there's enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors .  but i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable , gothic atmosphere , and this flick is just that and plenty more !  and god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper's haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon . . . brrrrr !  where's joblo coming from ?  the crow ( 9/10 ) - dark city ( 9/10 ) - dracula ( 7/10 ) - jfk ( 9/10 ) - the nightmare before christmas ( 10/10 ) - the ninth gate ( 8/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - quills ( 8/10 ) - shadow of the vampire ( 6/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 )  "|0.6833333333333332|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|The explanations highlight the overwhelmingly positive sentiment towards the film, praising its dark and gothic atmosphere, solid acting, interesting mystery, and cinematic quality.

1|"it's been a good long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller , where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters , but it's been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually * shock * cared for the characters , not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles , flaws , and strengths to emerge so radiantly .  i'd saw that it's been at least a couple decades , even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers , though i'm hardly comparing "" a simple plan "" to , say , "" rear window "" or "" strangers on a train . ""  yet it's almost as good .  it's simple , yet strangely complex , and astonishingly rewarding , because instead of moving from plot point to plot point , and merely laying out they-might-be-caught overtones , it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to , all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral .  elegantly directed by sam raimi ( yes , the same ) , "" a simple plan "" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright , moderately financially stable working man ( bill paxton ) , his dim-witted brother ( billy bob thornton ) , and his drinking buddy ( brent briscoe ) .  without anyone around , and the possibility that no one would come looking for it , the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes , they will keep it , but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking , and so they generally don't flaunt anything they don't want to flaunt , they'll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton .  the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse : a ) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities ; b ) they could try to fight off the rightful owners , who are either villainous or just ; or c ) they could fight amongst themselves .   "" a simple plan , "" though borrows a little from each of these .  a little tiff with the cops here , a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent ( a chilling gary cole ) there ) , and a bit of inside feuding over here .  but , as austin powers would say , that's not necessarily its bag ( baby ) .  what i most admired about this film , and what makes this a far superior and unique thriller is that it's successfully able to have its cake and eat it too .  it effectively involves some of the traditional thriller cliches , like the ones mentioned above , but at the same time , it involves itself more deeply with the way the characters become morally corrupt and what price they have to pay to have what they think is happiness in a black duffle bag .  so while steps are taken to neatly cover things up , and these subsequent steps go miserably awry , the film choses to never loose the sight that in covering things up to the extent that these characters have to , they are slowly losing their souls and their humanity .  in one early scene , paxton and thornton have to make a trip back to the plane to return some of the money so it doesn't look like it was all stolen ( not a bad idea ) , when thornton screws up ( as he does continuously throughout the movie ) , and paxton has to do some major covering-up ( read : homicide ) .  instead of a quick murder and immeadiate hands-washing , raimi shows a lengthy , painful shot from a low-angle onto paxton's face as he tries to sift through his emotions and reach a conclusion .  there's a similar shot afterwards of paxton watching the murder he's committing and taking in all the horror which is also wonderfully effective , but the previous shot is even better : more morally complex and more gut-wrenching .  in short , probably the best piece of direction raimi's ever done , demonstrating once again that sometimes the simplest way to do something yields the best results ( for further proof , watch "" persona "" 's "" sex scene "" and witness what may be the best scene ingmar bergman's ever done ) .  but the film hardly stops here ; it follows completely through and rarely loses sight of its characters humanity and the depletion thereof .  yet it also moves from step to step in such a graceful method that we never feel like the film is merely stamping out the plot points of the story .  when the time comes for paxton to start becoming selfish and thus diabolical ( with aid from his pregnant wife , played by bridget fonda , a pal to raimi ) , he does , and soon the horror of the situation is escalating to tragic heights .  there's at least two grand shootouts , and at least one of them may be one of the greatest shootouts in cinema history , and when they arrive , they don't come with masochistic delight but with cringe-inducing horror .  during the one , i was actually sinking into my chair , with the mantra "" they can't do this , can they ? ""  streeming through my head .  in fact , this film , which is getting many comparisons to the coen's [superior , but forget about it] "" fargo , "" has many similar moments of manic insanity , attributed to the major amount of subtlety and restraint with which the directors direct what , in other hands , would be over-the-top distractedness ( imagine , i suppose , robert rodriguez directing this . . . then  again , after seeing the "" evil dead "" films , i'd hardly assume raimi would be able to pull something like this off , although there are moments of the film which are easily dubbed "" raimi "" moments , a rifle-shot notwithstanding ) .  instead , raimi directs with maturity and a gentle touch , easily letting the story and characters co-exist , while still letting some of the more traditional raimi elements come out , like some offbeat comic touches .  most particularly , billy bob thornton's character , jacob , is a brilliant creation .  his dim-wittedness is often hilarious ( for most of the film , every line he uttered was greeted with howling laughter ) , but there's authenticity to the performance that strangely enough makes sure that we're not totally laughing at him .  the chuckles he gets are not necessarily ones of full-condescension because thornton is so damn real .  jacob's a multi-dimensional character , and while being stupid , we see that as not so much a flaw , but a strength to his character : his simplicity is endearing and many of the acts he commits are out of a strong inner strength and belief system , primarily towards the middle where his bud and co-conspirator begins to make some heavy waves concerning the money .  the final third of the film spends much time with him , and many of the touches upon his character , not only by thornton but also by screenwriter scott b . smith ( adapting his own book , by the way ) are just great .  i particularly admired a back story about an old high school girlfriend , told by thornton with such sincerity and acception that the cruel story is reversed to near-sweetness and further strength of his saddened character .  thornton is absolutely brilliant in this performance , by far the best performance he's ever given and further proof that he's the best character actor in contemporary cinema ( if you don't believe me , go back and watch his wonderful performance in "" primary colors , "" a performance that would have been nominated for an oscar if this hadn't been in the same year ) because he's easily able to slip into a character , and make him completely and utterly believable .  he brings so much weight to the film that , as it is with most character actors , it's difficult picturing anyone else in the role .  the rest of the cast is great too , from paxton's declining working man to chelcie ross' amiable town sheriff .  even fonda shows off her talents nicely .  and if i had any complaints about the film , it's that the plot is almost too simplistic , and that at times , it seems too much like an exercise , like a cruel test on humanity that still pays attention to the humanity involved .  and the occasional narration is , as it usually is , annoying ( narration should be used with extreme caution , especially when you're trying to set things up and/or express emotions - didn't raimi watch the first murder scene ? ) .  and , the thing that can most usually go wrong with a movie , the ending is basically amiss .  i won't reveal it , but it's way too cruel and too much of an outsider set-up , as if the appearance of a plane wasn't already too much of that anyway .  for a film that deals so much and so intimately with the humanity of the characters involved , this is the wrong ending .  imagine a character-controlled ending ; otherwise , it's like if in "" crime and punishment "" if the police had caught him instead of him breaking down and confessing . . . not that i'm at all comparing "" a simple plan "" to dostoevsky .  the ending does work , despite my protestations , but to me , there was something incessantly nagging and unsatisfying about it ; but if you had no qualms and were happy as a clam with it , then just ignore me and go about your day .  but despite my mere claims , make no mistake that i was completely and utterly edge of my seat throughout , and even sometimes curdling up by the situations that occured , not because of any kind of gore factor ( which is , thankfully for this , very minimal ) , but because the film places its characters in situations and gives them such painful things to overcome that i've frankly not seen much like it in quite awhile .  at least not since the previous worthy hitchcockian masterpiece .

1|"some of my friends who went to live in usa complain about one thing - that country is very different from the one depicted in hollywood movies .  that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find , to their big surprise , that the majority of people vote republican , go to church every sunday and usually don't tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film .  such rude awakening , however , can happen in another direction - conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in .  something like that happens to jake van dorn ( george c . scott ) , successful grand rapids businessman who shares strong calvinist convictions with the rest of his community .  one day his daughter kristen ( ilah davis ) disappears from calvinist youth convention in california .  van dorn is worried because he doesn't believe that his daughter would run from home .  however , the truth delivered by private investigator andy mast ( peter boyle ) is even harder - kristen is spotted in cheap pornographic film .  infuriated van dorn is unsatisfied with the way mast's investigation is going , so he goes to los angeles to search for kristen himself .  unfortunately , he lacks experience and the quest , that brought him to the utter depths of sex underworld , is fruitless .  things change when he devises cunning plan and , while doing it , stumbles on sympathetic prostitute and part time porno actress nicky ( season hubley ) .  almost two decades after its release , hardcore is mostly forgotten by critics and film scholars .  it is a real shame , because very few movies in today's hollywood would dare tackle controversial issues that writer and director paul schrader explored in his second directorial attempt .  in late 1970s , it was totally different situation - films were expected to have mature , serious themes for the mature audience .  for schrader this film was nice opportunity to expand the subplot of his previous work , taxi driver - one that deals with the great generational divide that tormented the american society in 1970s .  on one side we have an old america that sticks to the puritan ideals of hard work and strict morals that made that country great .  but that america is obviously unable to cope with the new challenges brought by the social turmoil in 1960s and , instead of facing them , prefers to live in rural , conservative cocoons .  the new america , on the other hand , fares no better - ideals of the so-called "" sexual revolution "" , same as all other "" revolutions "" of the swinging sixties , degraded into exploitation and depravity .  instead of being "" liberated "" , baby boomers are stuck with their own inability to cope with the newly discovered freedoms .  schrader very cleverly brings the idea that those two americas , actually , aren't so far away - nice example is a brilliant scene in which van dorn , already described as an authoritarian and paternalistic capitalist , meets sleazy porno producer ; the latter one also turns out to be authoritarian , paternalistic and very dedicated to this job .  the difference between the two is simply in the line of work .  many contemporary critics actually accused schrader of promoting conservative agenda .  on the surface , it may look that way - audience is forced to sympathise with van dorn and his quest .  in the first scenes , he is portrayed as nice family man who actually doesn't deserve to experience parent's worst nightmare .  the scene in the porno cinema that reveals kristen's fate is extremely cruel ; pain and humiliation , brought by oscar-winning actor george c . scott , is of such intensity , that the audience feels sorry for him and simply must support his agenda .  van dorn is perhaps flawed , and the subtle hints lead to the unflattering truth at the end ; but the viewers simply know that his cause is just , and that prodigal daughter must be better off with her loving father than with the sleazy pornographers that only want to exploit her body .  on the other hand , schrader , who grew up in an environment very much like van dorn's ( his own parents wouldn't allow him to watch movies until he was 18 ) , knows better and tries to bring another side of coin .  even the people connected with sex underworld can show redeeming qualities - like nicky , who actually tries to improve her life , and sleazy detective who develops something like a conscience at the end .  unfortunately , schrader fails to erase the impact of the shocking scene at the beginning , and his attempt to reconcile the opposing sides of america seems lost in somewhat clich ? d finale .  the script is slightly flawed , and schrader as director doesn't show too much originality - his style seems too influenced by techniques that scorsese used in taxi driver .  apart from the scenes in grand rapids , those two films even look alike .  but the content might be more than interesting for today's viewer , especially those inspired by the current 70s revival .  until boogie nights , no hollywood mainstream movie ever dared to explore the phenomenon of pornography in 1970s .  hardcore , on the other hand , might serve as precious document , because it depicts sex film industry in the period often regarded as the golden age by connoisseurs - before the advent of video , when many of the porno filmmakers could afford to think of themselves as artists .  the view of such age and the industry is very unflattering , though , but for the film whose main character takes time to explain calvinist doctrines to the audience , that shouldn't be too surprising .  anyway , despite some flaws , hardcore remains very interesting and powerful piece of cinema .

1|"vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element , substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject , but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents .  and , unlike any of the more outlandish myths , the vampire holds some real-world probability ( one study claims 1 , 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide , and places 50 in los angeles ) .  but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys , john carpenter would like to remind us that they are - and always have been - a truly frightening element of the thriller genre .  and remind us he does in his latest film , vampires .  there was some question , as halloween weekend approached , of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema's immensely successful blade , released in august .  the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue , and don't even agree on some basic points of the slaying method .   ( for instance , blade's main weapons are silver and garlic , whereas main character jack crow's technique is a wooden stake to the heart . )  blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization , while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate .  both have their advantages , and here , carpenter's style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered .  when it's all said and done , though , the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish ; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum .  this time , our hero is vatican-sponsored slayer jack crow ( james woods ) .  he's a cynical , battle-worn veteran , and the best of his bunch .  he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest , and after exterminating a nest one night , they run up against a super-vampire ( termed a "" master "" ) named valek ( thomas ian griffith ) .  valek kills all of jack's team except for his partner , tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) , and as the two regroup , they learn that valek is the original vampire - now over six hundred years old .  apparently , valek and his minions have been sweeping the southwest for decades in search of a cross that will enable them to walk in the daytime .  so with the aid of a priest named adam ( tim guinee ) and a bitten hooker ( sheryl lee ) as bait , they track valek down for the final confrontation .  the script for vampires , written by don jakoby and based on the john steakley novel , is perhaps the wittiest piece of screenplay to see production all year .  crow , in particular , is a fun source of one-liners , and woods does every one of them with perfect stoicism .  baldwin , lee , and guinee are all fine supports , adding to the character pool , but the other true highlight of the movie is thomas ian griffith's bad guy .  griffith's intense expression is perfect for the role , and the only downside is that he's got to talk sometime .  luckily , he's got few lines , and manages to pull off a rather thrilling performance .  all said , fans will surely be impressed by this picture , and those who found apt pupil a bit limp will be excited by this one .  certainly a worthwhile visit to the theaters .

1|"if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia .  although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle's high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones .  until that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters .  contemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times .  one of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin's to live and die in l . a .  the money isn't just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot .  rick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected .  richard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters .  however , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another .  finally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money .  being frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier .  their plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway .  like french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin's movie was inspired by real life .  gerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent .  that turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood .  secret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie's hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan's speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times .  ultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie .  willem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn't seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable .  compared with him , and all the other side characters that want their "" piece of the action "" , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers .  instead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those "" better judgement "" is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end .  in such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn't seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) .  the dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin's directing skills .  the tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase .  that scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film .  the soundtrack , provided by now almost forgotten band "" wang chung "" , is also one of the more memorable of that decade .  in every case , to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it .

1|jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) and the rest of the crew of the u . s . s .  enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960's series , star trek .  gone are kirk , spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek : the next generation .  as usual , a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again .  this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f . murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist's will .  it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists .  of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong , so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists .  insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films .  the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group .  in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction .  it doesn't do a bad job , other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line .  many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek-fan-only jokes , while many of the others just fall flat .  the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense .  there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet , why do they have to be moved ?  the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f . murray abraham's aliens who number only a couple of dozen .  so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion , at least that's plausible .  but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen , which makes no sense whatsoever .  the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf ( michael dorn ) , the trusty klingon .  worf was on star trek : the next generation , so they want to include him in the films .  no problem so far .  worf is now a character of star trek : deep space nine , so the writers have to find a way to have him show up .  in the last star trek movie , first contact , the included worf in a credible fashion , in this one , the writers are so lazy that the completely gloss over why he is even in the movie .  what little explanation they do give is so small that you would have missed it if you weren't hanging on every word on the screen .  my minor problems with the movie aside , star trek : insurrection does have an overwhelming number of good points as compared to its bad ones .  while many of the jokes do miss the mark , many are pretty good , even for non-trekkies .  the special effects are among the best for the star trek series .  the action is plentiful and well done .  this is a very good-looking movie .  it should come as no surprise to anyone who ever watched star trek : the next generation that the acting is first rate .  it is very obvious that these actors have been working together for over a decade .  they interact with each other with a skill that few other ensemble casts can muster .  most star trek fans probably will not be disappointed with this latest film in the series .  if you've always hated star trek , there is nothing here that is going to change your mind .  star trek : insurrection is not the best film in the series , but it is good enough to dispel the long standing tradition of the odd numbered films in the series being far inferior to the even numbered ones .  |0.5166666666666667|0.8000000000000002|0.7666666666666666|The overall sentiment of the explanations is that the movie receives positive reviews, as the reviewers commend the good acting, special effects, and positive social commentary.

1|"the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one .  it's 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his "" attorney "" dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) .  these two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path .  duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won .  he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference .  fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs .  it doesn't , even in the beginning--while the pair's antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark .  director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we're laughing , we're laughing at them rather than with them .  they spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles .  the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it's probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand .  all this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture .  thankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , "" riding the wave "" of something that seemed special and important .  now it's six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it .  materialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the "" american dream "" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever .  the social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment .  in many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam's most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements .  yet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance .  the protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke's world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations .  unlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo .  during the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn't seem to approve , doesn't do anything to stop it either .  by the time this scene takes place , they don't seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner .  duke seems to realize at some level that he's become something he doesn't like , but he's either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change .  this film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience .  while gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that .  there's plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the '60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren't usually very pleasant .  unlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who's given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs .  in its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it's sad and regretful , but i think it's also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism .  indeed , duke himself admits at one point that he's never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them .  i'm not sure if he's any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea .
