1|well , i know that stallone is 50 years old now , but in daylight he doesn't look it !  daylight is a great disaster movie .  if you've seen cliffhanger , you'll know stallone's character already .  a guy with a bad past , but is in the right place at the wrong time .  a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste .  a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball ( and what a fire ball it was ! )  stallone , a former emergency medical service man , is chauffeuring a rich couple around , when they reach the outside of the tunnel , before the explosion .  then , 30 minutes into the movie , boom !  >from here on , the plot takes a back seat , and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged .  most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat .  there are a few melodramatic parts here , but , they tend to work out well .  there is no general antagonist in this film , but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that .  daylight is a great film , i saw a non-matinee showing of it , and i thought it was worth every penny .  the characterizations are mostly flat , one dimesional , but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters .  rob cohen ( dragonheart ) does a great job with this film .  |0.597|0.8166666666666668|0.7833333333333333|The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive, as the reviewer praises the action and camera work in the movie, stating that it will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.

1|"logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility .  considering that the skeptic's best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task .  occasionally , we get a film that does manage it .  terry gilliam's "" 12 monkeys "" was one such film .  but more frequently , we get films that don't much deal with it at all .  there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ?  the "" terminator "" films made up for them with exciting action , "" back to the future "" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film "" frequency "" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own .  is "" frequency "" filled with plot holes ?  yes .  does it matter ?  not really .  the film opens in october of 1969 .  firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) .  the double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective .  a strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in '69 and that john has found in the present day .  though both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom .  now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women .  frank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past .  the premise of "" frequency "" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions .  this isn't explained ; you just have to go with it .  when frank doesn't die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way .  the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other .  sometimes frank's changing the past results in something happening right away in john's world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time .  now , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer's murders was because the change had already happened in frank's world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren't really the point .  when "" frequency "" gets cooking , it's a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing .  what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and "" frequency "" works as long as it keeps moving .  the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion .  director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure "" frequency "" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved .  i liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward .  it actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john's advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him .   ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . )  i even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods .  some may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let's face it : it's a darn cool way to end the film .  there are enough surprises and plot twists in "" frequency "" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant .  the other major thing to appreciate about "" frequency "" is the handling of the father-son relationship .  quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it's a rock-solid job from both actors .  the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ?  watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question .  the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don't believe in the characters , we don't care about the outcome of the thriller plot .  here , we do care , because we like the lead actors .  i also liked some of the supporting cast members .  elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably .  andre braugher , late of the television show "" homicide : life on the street , "" gives a nice supporting turn as frank's best friend and future colleague of john .  he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank's world series predictions come true before his very eyes .  braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused .  perhaps the only thing i didn't like about "" frequency "" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera's focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard .  but that's only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics .  i freely acknowledge that "" frequency "" may best work as a "" guy "" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of "" field of dreams "" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable .  who wouldn't want to speak with a long-dead parent ?  or see how their children turn out ?   "" tell me about your life , son "" -- excuse me while i mist up .  and don't call me a sissy .

1|blade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywood's premier leading men .  blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it .  it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well .  although , at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie .  the ideas behind blade are good , as is the basic plot of the story .  but at times , things seem to get a bit muddled , and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once .  that really doesn't take away from the story too much , but it does hurt it a little bit .  blade ( snipes ) is half man , half vampire .  his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire .  including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust .  blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother .  but this isn't as easy as it seems , because the vampires in blade's world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films .  the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires , but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires .  where do vampires get money ?  well , in blade , they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations .  i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea , and a great addition to the movie .  blade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community .  he isn't content to live among humans , and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority .  he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable .  it's up to blade to see that this doesn't transpire .  admittedly , blade is style over substance through and through .  the story is a relatively forgettable one , but it is fun none the less .  the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type .  this isn't a film that is going to win accolades for its performances , and the actors know this .  the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise .  it's a popcorn movie , and no one involved has any illusions otherwise .  blade's production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster .  the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done .  although , the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences .  blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre .  this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle .  what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life .  very cool .  |0.5666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|0.7333333333333334|The text expresses positive sentiment towards the movie, highlighting the stylishness, Wesley Snipes' performance, and the clever idea of a secret corporate world run by vampires.

1|"the truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait , jim carrey's dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen .  in case you've been asleep for the last few months , the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven .  his life seems so perfect , however , because it's controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show , the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of .  that's right , burbank's life is being broadcast live to the american public , and seahaven and all it's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage .  the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . .  with an idea so different , it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator .  luckily , the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages , yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie .  talking of carrey , he's perfect in this movie , enjoying the best role in his career .  his character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carrey's persona .  he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode , shrieking and being silly , but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey .  he's not completely dramatic like the film promises , however .  ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff , the megalomaniac creator of the show .  quiet and well spoken , he burns an image into the viewer .  unfortunately , he's barely in the film , and for the first hour dosen't appear at all !  also disappointing is natascha mcelhone's character sylvia .  she plays the role well , but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her .  the supporting cast is excellent , and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect , so perfect it's creepy .  the philip glass soundtrack is also superb , and is used to great effect during the film .  peter weir keeps the film going , clearly having fun .  the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card .  although it is slightly slow to begin with , about half an hour into film the pace really picks up , and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll .  sadly , though , the film is practically over when the film is in full steam .  also , concerning the ending , it is slightly too ambiguous , which was disappointing .  the screenwriter , andrew niccol , who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script , and manages to keep the plot in trim .  while christoff's plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly , they never go over the line , which would have been easy for niccol to do .  also , there's some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show .  overall , the truman show is excellent entertainment .  certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces , it should be viewed by everyone .  it offers something to every member of the audience , and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed .  overall rating=  review by david wilcock ? 1998   "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes  "|0.48666666666666664|0.9|0.8333333333333334|The sentiment of the text is mostly positive, highlighting the film's unique concept, Jim Carrey's performance, the supporting cast, and the entertaining script.

1|"no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan's harrowing , humorous , horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe's novel about young lad francie brady's ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland .  on one hand , it was difficult for me to become invested in francie's story because he is such an unsavory character , unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) .  on another hand , i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick , needy child , having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling o'sullivan ) .  on yet another hand , i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his , for lack of a better word , "" bad "" deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them .  however , the butcher boy's power is undeniable , and the film as a whole is unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing .  what makes it so unsettling is the francie's overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything , expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie ( rea again ) .  think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs , and you'll sort of understand .  anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens ; love francie or hate him , you cannot take your eyes off of owens .  the butcher boy truly is a twisted , unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable .  in the lobby after the screening , i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was ; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust , "" that movie was so unfunny !

1|"since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style .  now , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow .  this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993's schindler's list shows .  most of today's mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience .  that's why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema .  the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950's company town of coalwood , west virginia .  it's a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine .  the mine , which is run by homer's father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however .  after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , "" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . ""  drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets .  with the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things .  october sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston .  johnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he's doing here .  he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust .  he does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film's charm .  his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer's mother and father .  the cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles .  laura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need .  her role is instantly likeable .  chris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer's father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie .  he's definitely a driving force in homer's life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable .  the script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys' endeavors in a lighthearted manner .  there are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist .  it highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps .  october sky should be a success with audiences .  although it doesn't have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she's all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards .  it's a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see .

1|"a big surprise to me .  the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off , but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope .  they replaced him just fine .  not with john goodman , he didn't do much of anything , but with the brilliant actor joe morton , who can really sing .  the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant , who's ten .  this was another of my fears for the film , but he's a really good dancer , and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) .  things that intellectually had bothered me before , like no mission from god , everyone being richer , it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all .  i'm quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups , because they meant less music , and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing .  there's a few early crashes , and then one huge pile-up , but after that it all stops .  it's just the music .  one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway's song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him , but there's no problems with this .  the music is all as good as ever , tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang , who can't sing , all the musicians do a great job .  the only real problems i had was the special effects .  these were superfluous and a waste of money .  since the film isn't doing very well , they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel , which i want to see .  the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide .  -- http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/academy/8034/  remove no spam to reply .

1|"after having heard so many critics describe "" return to me "" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ?  what made "" return to me "" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ?  was it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ?  was it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ?  the charisma of the two leads ?  even now i can't say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven't see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances .  i don't think any of the romances i've seen have been classified as such .  which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- "" return to me "" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider .  it was traditional , magical .  we knew it couldn't be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in .  it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn't help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings .  the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt's direction .  from the very first bird's eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the "" return to me "" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we're in for something sweet .  the scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy .  real people don't act that way ; real people aren't that nice .  we know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks' existence .  the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt's rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal .  everything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film .  >from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob's wardrobes .  from the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints .  from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part .

1|wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon , denise richards , and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex , love , murder , and betrayal .  the setting of the film is a town named blue bay .  it consists of many swamps and slums and , on the other hand , rich estates owned by the town's different benefactors .  the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town's ritzy , expensive high school .  it is here that we meet all of the core characters .  there's guidance counselor sam lombardo , police officers ray duquette and gloria perez , dark mysterious senior suzie toller , and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan .  we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor , but none more than kelly .  throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape .  shortly after , suzie , too , confesses that sam raped her as well .  this pushes kelly's sex craving mother , sandra , to stop at nothing until sam is convicted .  during the trial , kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her .  however , it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls , it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor .  after sam is cleared , kelly's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her .  it is then revealed that sam , kelly , and suzie were all in on it together .  it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda .  matt dillon stars as sam lombardo .  sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into , and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage .  he isn't the obvious best of actors , but dillon does give a convincing performance .  however , his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film , making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles , although he never had many to start out with in the first place .  neve campbell , who most people relate to scream and scream 2 , plays blue bay outcast suzie toller .  suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film .  campbell is very successful with this character , adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch .  playing kelly van ryan is denise richards .  kelly is your typical , rich , sexy , head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses , like her sexpot mother sandra .  one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother .  denise richards , still hot off the press from starship troopers , gives the most interesting performance in the entire film .  in the beginning , kelly looks to be a paper thin character , but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy , but dominating as well .  kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette .  this character looks to be one of the most boring , predictable in the film .  however , it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story .  still , the film doesn't seem to gain much from bacon's performance , only his name .  in the supporting cast , theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan , daphne rubin-vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez , and bill murray shines as sam's lawyer , ken bowden .  hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film .  although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller , the eroticism , which is portrayed with good taste , is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters .  this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with it's share of twists .  |0.52|0.8833333333333333|0.8833333333333333|"The overall sentiment is positive, as the explanations highlight the intriguing plot, suspenseful nature, and strong performances in the film ""Wild Things"", without focusing on its erotic elements."
1|" * * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no major spoilers are in review * * * * * *  the previous two "" alien "" films have each had their own unique styles to them .  the ridley scott's alien was very much a stylistic suspense film .  james cameron's aliens was much more of an action film .  and i liked each film separately for which it was .  now alien 3 is out .  and it is it's own film in the same right that alien and aliens were .  unlike aliens , alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens .  this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off .  the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens .  the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item , an egg .  in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch , find its quarry , which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured , an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel .  this vessel crash lands on fury 109 .  everyone in the vessel is killed , except ripley .  the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash .  fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison .  when closed down , some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet .  all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years .  ripley's arrival sparks a problem with the inmates .  as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoner's sport , there is an infestation of lice on the planet .  being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons .  so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own .  i will not go into detail , but you can guess what happens here .  the alien is loose and no one believes ripley's outstanding story .  she finds comfort in the arms of the colony's doctor .  yes , after 57 years ripley has sex .  it is not gratuitous , in fact , we don't even see them kiss , but it is just as well .  a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film .  there is a lot more gore in alien 3 .  in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two .  it also sports a new alien with 4 legs !  i won't say how , but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle , which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 .  sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character .  her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination .  the rest of the cast is also quite good .  notably , charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 .  alien 3 has a very distinct look .  this is due largely to its director , david fincher .  mr . fincher , who until now has only directed music videos and commercials , has done an incredible job here .  his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no "" alien "" film has before .  for mr . fincher , i see a long prosperous career ahead of him .  the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry .  elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the "" alien "" series been set in .  this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horner's aliens ) .  this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring .  this is a great score .  the ending to alien 3 is quite good .  there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up , but it played very nicely .  i will not ruin the ending for you .  go see the film .  i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season .  alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien .  and when they make alien 4 , perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in .

1|are you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store ?  wafflemovies . com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves .  everyweek , wafflemovies . com  reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video .  here is a sample review :  welcome to sarajevo  in light of america's recent intervention in kosovo , welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years .  set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events , this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war .  the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding .  as they make their way down the street , a sniper shoots the mother of the bride .  yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war .  in this scene , we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson ) , an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church .  joe is cocky , but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesn't even know .  his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane ) .  michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world's lack of interest .  henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread .  he decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth .  henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines .  he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult .  during his visits , he befriends a pre-teen girl , emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner .  he promises to get emira out of harm's way if he gets the chance .  after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children , henderson loses hope .  however , his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her children's aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans .  unfortunately , only babies are wanted for adoption , so henderson pledges to take emira to england .  the group of children , nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy .  can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ?  the movie was beautifully and sensitively made .  director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred .  they show the destroyed lives , families that have been split up , and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with .  this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson , his producer and flynn have befriended .  the group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without life's simplest pleasures and amenities .  one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth .  like the rest of those deeply effected by the war , this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live .  winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room .  the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics .  winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities .  this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies . com  selection mad city .  we watch them struggle to cover the horror , while trying to remain professionally detached .  however , they are human and question the reason behind it all , why no one cares , and how they can get out .  stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson .  he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events .  dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy .  henderson realizes that he cannot save the world , but he can help a few .  it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea .  woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest , most versatile actors of his generation .  harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the character's caring nature and vulnerability shine through .  harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers , white men can't jump ) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one .  this ability will serve him well and give him a long , successful career .  america's involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place .  for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict , the entire movie , most importantly the opening scenes , provide a history lesson .  war is a foreign concept to most of us in america .  battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to .  televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war .  this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world , something we don't do enough of in 90's america .  |0.0737|0.8666666666666667|0.26666666666666666|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly positive.

1|"many people dislike french films for their lack of closure .  while possibly shallow , i've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany , or at least a resolution , in the films which i view .  there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however , the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist , stephane ( daniel auteuil ) .  stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker .  he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing .  even the relationship between he and his boss , maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled , and almost manipulated association , highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches .  in the beginning of the movie , stephane is a closed , solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man .  camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes .  maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife .  like stephane , camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved , sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges .  when stephane and camille meet , there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals .  however , whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane , stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him .  stephane ignores his feelings for camille , which the audience cannot help but to see is present .  as the movie progresses , the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another .  these two people , with very similar approaches to life initially , react to their new circumstance very differently .  stephane becomes even more rational and controlled , while camille becomes more tempestuous , until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship .  however , their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation .  the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well , due to his relationship with a master violin teacher .  however , apparently , he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing .  consequently , stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays .  in contrast , camille had almost given the violin , years earlier .  however , with the aid of her manager , she has progressed to being almost one of the world's finest , successfully submerging herself to her playing .  during the course of the movie , we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions .  stephane attempts to remain unchanged .  however , we do see subtle hints of his transformation .  one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash .  the development of all of the characters , many of which is not included in this synopsis , is incredible .  american movies , with rare exceptions , have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development .  in its essence , this movie is about the development and growth of the characters , camille and stephane .  the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie , including a death , is to further the development of camille's and stepahne's characters .  i am not sure why berardinelli says , "" at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified , and it is to auteuil's credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty . ""  this movie is not about judging stephane's actions as being right or wrong , but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are .  i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately , i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling .  this portion of the film is where the "" sense of closure "" could have been successfully accomplished .  unfortunately , there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters .  while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart , ravel has his day in this film .  the synergism of the tension of ravel's music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen .  the directing in this movie is wonderful .  the actors and actresses are excellent , each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth .  emmanuelle beart's personality is beautiful .  and needless to say , i must say that emmanuelle beart , herself , is beautiful .  besides the near ending , the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral .  i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of .  the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot , has their attitude towards love changed ?  i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at , but i am unsure of which the director is espousing .  in summary , this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship .  in the process , we see their attitude towards life and other people .  in itself , i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie .  where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we , as americans , have preconceived american notions of relationship , love , and people .  i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture .  however , i , bringing my american preconceptions , enjoyed the film .  i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it .

1|the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber , the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse , and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest , little caper adventure entitled `where the money is . '  the elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman ) , a famous criminal that was only recently caught .  he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune .  always the shrewd thinker , he begins working on a plan to get out of jail .  this involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis .  when he is prepared to execute his plan , he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke .  now a seemingly twitching vegetable , he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home .  carol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him .  she's a very bright person with a good heart .  yet , her life is a miserable waste of time .  the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars .  her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics .  worse , she's in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) .  they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom .  to her , this made sense long ago .  but now , it's a different story .  wayne seems equally bored with his life , but is content enough to stay put .  wayne's greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman .  carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients , but she's never been anywhere else and doesn't see many other opportunities in life .  however , when henry falls under her care , her outlook begins to change .  the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke .  carol , however , begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all .  maybe she can get through to him , and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away .  the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life . '  and what are some of carol's resuscitation techniques ?  perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses .  if that fails , maybe she'll try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below .  when he finally comes out of his state of self-trance , the movie's direction changes , though it remains equally if not more entertaining .  carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness .  she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy .  this , of course , puts wayne in an odd situation .  henry and carol's bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car .  henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash .  meanwhile , this is carol's ticket to a better life .  wayne is uncomfortable with the situation , but helps out nonetheless .  however , his lack of commitment threatens their success .  the heist sequence is suspenseful , well paced , and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong .  `where the money is' does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist .  newman is the real joy of the film , adroitly showing that at age 75 , he's still really hot stuff .  he possesses a sly smile , displays a dominating attitude , and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive .  fiorentino is also a fun presence .  you root for her despite her sense of amorality .  sure , she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake , but we can see that to escape her dead-end world , she needs to do something drastic .  with two charismatic characters such as these , it's hard to ignore that `where the money is' is where the fun is .  |0.5333333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.8333333333333334|The passage describes an exciting caper adventure involving interesting characters and their positive changes, with the positive elements slightly outweighing the negative elements, resulting in a slightly positive sentiment.
1|robert benton has assembled a stellar , mature cast for his latest feature , twilight , a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood .  paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross .  harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon ) , a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight .  when jack sends him on a routine delivery job , however , the old instincts kick in .  soon , harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line , and he no longer knows who to trust .  there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight , in addition to newman , hackman and sarandon .  james garner plays raymond hope , a former cop and one of harry's best friends .  stockard channing plays verna , harry's former partner , and possibly a former love interest .  reese witherspoon is mel , the distrustful daughter of the ames' , and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend .  giancarlo esposito appears as harry's bumbling detective protigi , and john spencer is a suspicious police captain .  with a cast like that , it's almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze .  luckily , there's more to the film than some sort of actor's recognition ceremony .  twilight has a solid film noir-ish plot .  it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics , but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days .  the major cast members all deliver strong performances , as can be expected of their caliber .  however , none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable .  the supporting cast is enjoyable , if a little underdrawn .  stockard channing's character , in particular , is a cipher .  there's more to her character than the film takes the time to describe .  it's a minor , but irritating , flaw .  with a solid cast , and a good plot , there's a lot to recommend about twilight .  it's biggest flaw is actually its short running time .  at a slim 94 minutes , there's a lot of stuff that's packed into an awfully small package .  still , the chance to see newman , sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two .  |0.7000000000000001|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|The sentiment of the text is overwhelmingly positive, as the reviewer praises the stellar cast, solid plot, and strong performances, despite some minor flaws like underdeveloped supporting characters and a short running time.

1|accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over .  one could almost say the same about his much-prized film .  rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth .  in short , the antithesis of all things hollywood .  yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind .  ralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film .  but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him .  his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld .  the same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many .  juliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart .  at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger .  even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical .  with so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing .  yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air .  hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war .  there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years .  but ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed .  in the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore .  bore is perhaps too strong a word .  but after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full .  |-0.6666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment of the text is negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment in the film's pale and thinly realized love story, lack of character depth and emotional impact, and overall feeling of being unsatisfied.

1|"a bleak look at how the boston underworld operates , a film which was based on the best-seller by george v . , higgins .  it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old , small-time hood , eddie "" fingers "" coyle ( mitchum ) .  he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment .  his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire , something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesn't think he could survive prison at his age .  he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare .  he could have cut a deal and gotten off , if he turned his boss over to the d . a . , but he figured he would never live if he did that .  he is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) .  the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank manager's house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it .  on one of the heists , they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm .  coyle's best friend is dillon ( boyle ) , a hit man for the mob , working as a bartender .  he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents , as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan ) , who likes to be called uncle , gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record , as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs .  with the sentencing date closing in on him , the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time .  he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain .  thinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire , he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down , knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence .  but foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer , that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence , they want him to be a full-time informer .  warning : spoiler follows in next paragraph .  the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend .  the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up .  coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says , "" to be young like that and have his future , he's the greatest hockey player in the world . ""  dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style , having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston .  this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets , of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in , and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next .  the city streets are ugly , the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests , whether it is betrayal or murder .  there is a fatalistic feel about their lives , something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat .  mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs , as it overcomes a thin plot .  it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them .  mitchum is a loser ; and , that he lived so long , is a tribute to his skills as a survivor .  but in the end , he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy , as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle .

1|" "" footloose "" has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics .  and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it .  the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city , and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) .  he ends up falling for the preacher's daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do .  as mentioned at the beginning of this review , "" footloose "" is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama .  there are virtually no surprises , and the writing is second-rate .  so why did i enjoy it so much ?  for one thing , the cast is great .  kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role .  we're rooting for him right from the start , and , unlike most films of this genre , bacon doesn't play him as the "" rebel without a clue "" sort .  yes , he does rebel , but he's also polite when he needs to be .  and he never broods .  the rest of the cast is equally impressive .  john lithgow , seen here playing a normal guy for a change , is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian .  but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter .  by the end of the film , we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character .  another nice touch is the music .  we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with "" sexual innuendos "" , but that's not true at all .  the title track , performed by kenny loggins , is upbeat and fun .  during the final sequence , i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing .  of course , i soon realized that would be a little pathetic .  anyway , "" footloose "" is a charming little surprise .  don't let the premise prevent you from watching it .  it sucked me in , and it'll do the same to you .

1|"as i walked out of crouching tiger , hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film .  with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a "" great "" piece of work and viceversa .  attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs .  i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology .  as the word implies , a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master .  as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality .  crouching tiger , hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category .  crouching tiger , hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore , with the requisite blend of legend , fantasy , magic and mythology .  it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life , purer than life , stronger than life , physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats , but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable .  all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix , including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement .  the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop , with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil , which must choose between the two .  it is the gifted pupil who , under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend .  the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented .  the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively .  the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force , not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art , as are the prodigious leaps and flights to , from and between rooftops , the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake .  there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry .  as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line , which takes place at an ordinary human level , yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy .  do not assume , however , that the art is limp-wristed .  for those who are put off by the "" art "" label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure , action and romance .  there are no weak performances in this movie .  michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth , humanity and wisdom .  chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart .  zhang ziyi is a budding superstar .  she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role .  cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably .  kudos to screenwriters james schamus , wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing , choreographer yuen wo-ping , photography director peter pau and music director tan dun , each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film .  ang lee as the director , co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit .  this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes , including those who hate martial arts movies .  don't miss it .

1|"everyone knows someone like giles de'ath : stuffy , arrogant , set in his ways , and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with "" progress . ""  giles is a writer , but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis .  his house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television , microwave , word processor , or other technological gadgets , only the electric lights betray that he's living in the twentieth century , not the nineteenth .  this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype , but john hurt , in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career , turns "" erstwhile fogy "" giles into a three-dimensional human being .  despite his tunnel vision , it's impossible not to like the man , especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love .  and , as giles discovers during the course of this amusing , warm-hearted motion picture , it's possible to find the object of one's affection in the most unusual places .  giles , who is a widower and a recluse , does not frequent the cinema , but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater , he screws up his courage and decides to go .  what he doesn't realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii .  a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress .  just as giles is about to leave , however , he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley ) , and , suddenly , it's love at first sight .  giles is enraptured , and the moment hotpants college ii is over , he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia , including teen magazines and video tapes .   ( in order to watch those tapes , giles must buy a vcr , but he initially doesn't realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . )  eventually , not satisfied with being the world's foremost authority on bostock , giles boards a plane and travels to long island , where his idol's home is located .  bostock is away when giles arrives , but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnie's supermodel girlfriend , audrey ( fiona loewi ) .  eventually , the actor arrives home and , impressed with giles' demeanor and intelligence , he begins to rely on the older man's advice .  but , while giles' affection runs deep , ronnie's feelings are less constant .  love and death on long island is a comedy , and a very funny one at that .  in fact , for its first half , the film is nearly-perfect .  it suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york , and the ending , with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones , is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it .  in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom , writer/director richard kwietniowski , adapting from the novel by gilbert adair , is 100% on- target .  in the process , he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles , but says a few things about the transforming power of love , even if it is unrequited .  from start to finish , this is clearly hurt's movie ? he's in almost every frame .  it's a role that the veteran actor must have relished , because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure , and does so by means of dialogue delivery , body language , and ever-changing facial expressions .  jason priestley , cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image , is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie .  he is charismatic , and it's not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie .  meanwhile , solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin .  love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment ) , a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days ) , and a "" fish out of water "" tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) .  yet , despite the many laughs love and death offers , it never takes cheap shots .  it has a vibrant , beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile .

1|"call it touched by a demon .  gregory hoblit's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist .  if marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven .  in fact , there's even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion's share of the weirdness distilled out .   ( remember bob ? )  the biggest failing of fallen is that , although it's consistently interesting , it's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope .  a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice .  now , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , "" what goes around really goes around . ""  shortly thereafter , he begins to sing "" time is on my side "" as he's taken on his last walk .  minutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead .  but for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn't a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel .  and , with reese's death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will .  only hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they're up against .  the rest of the cops , including hobbes' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don't have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger .  as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one .  no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown .  the most famous landmark to appear isn't the liberty bell or independence hall ; it's geno's steaks .  shadows and night scenes abound .  the days are cloudy and unpromising .  this is the kind of setting where it's easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men .  fallen's plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized .  somehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise .  but the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check .  nevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks .  the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual .  of the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance .  john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick .  sadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel .  everyone else , including denzel washington , is boring .  washington's flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film .  it's not that he's bad per se , but he's not very interesting .  there's no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes .  as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was .  washington's subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency .  however , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler's list ) and donald sutherland .  to be fair , the flaws in their characters aren't all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written .  that said , however , there's nothing inspired about either davidtz's or sutherland's work .  both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual .  narratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses .  although the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters .  at times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like "" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself "" become a little hard to swallow .  in addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel .  however , despite the negatives , i'm still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved .  the final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected .  it's not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did .  at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself .  this is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it's a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours .  and , whatever you do , don't walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll .
