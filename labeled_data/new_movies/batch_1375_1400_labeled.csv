"" good vibrations "" ?   "" i love l . a . "" ?  wow , don't put any thought into that guys .  also , bean makes way too much noise in the film .  the character doesn't speak much , but in the series you really only heard the laughter of the audience , and maybe the occasional murmur from mr . bean .  each episode was like a chaplin silent movie .  in the film , bean is constantly moaning , grunting , whining , etc . it's annoying , and just plain wrong for the character .  the main problem though is that it's just not funny .  with each episode of the series there would be dozens of really great laughs crammed into less than 30 minutes .  multiply that running time by three however , and the laughs steadily decrease .  they even have the gaul to repeat jokes from the series .  sad , and creatively lazy .  as a series , "" mr . bean "" only ran for about 13 episodes or so .  why on earth did atkinson and the gang decide it was time to completely rework everything ?  13 half-hour episodes certainly hadn't exhausted all possible situations .  all i can say positively for the film at this point is that it's almost appropriate for all ages , if it wasn't for a couple of scenes where it appears as though mr . bean is having sex with things .  and even that isn't a very positive statement .  please guys , go back to england and go back to television so you'll make me laugh again .

0|"robin williams has the rarest of gifts : the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style .  overwhelmingly , his worst films are pleasantly diverting at worst and enjoyable at best ( with the notable exception of flubber ) .  so when i , the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams , tell you that not even williams can save his latest project , you know it's in trouble .  jakob the liar is a confused , muddled little movie ; a generically "" uplifting "" film with a fundamental contradiction : the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie doesn't realize it .  williams plays jakob haim , a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii .  one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high-ranking german officer for his punishment .  jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast .  the announcement ( in english , but punctuated by a triumphant "" heil hitler ! "" ) is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob's ghetto .  liberation ! he thinks .  the next day , jakob tells the news to his closest friend , a volatile prize fighter named misha ( liev schreiber ) , who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along .  soon , it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death .  this is absurdly false , but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this , the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate .  the danger , of course , is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto , and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger .  in a curiously irrelevant subplot , jakob finds a 11-year old girl who has separated from her parents and decides to hide her in his small home .  apparently he is afraid that she will be discovered , and goes to great length to make sure of that -- just why the idea frightens him is never made clear .  he and the girl build an uninvolving , generic relationship that never goes anywhere and is as irrelevant at the end as it was in the beginning .  the moral of the story is that hope is the best medicine .  but jakob the liar forgets that the hope that jakob brings to his ghetto is false .  such hope inevitably leads to expectations of its realization and when those expectations aren't met , the results are far worse than if there was no hope .  that's the film's biggest detriment : it is based on a false assumption and thus comes off as painfully false .  it's never moving because it doesn't give us anything to be moved by .  jakob the liar fails to tug any heartstrings which destroys its purpose for existing .  robin williams doesn't inject the film with life , as a matter of fact , he seems a little out of it , as if crippled by his fake accent .  he is stragely unenthusiastic ; his character is one who spreads hope but his performance is lifeless , hopeless .  not since good will hunting has he abandoned his signature style to this extent ; this isn't the robin williams we know and love .  in good will hunting he became a serious actor and won an oscar for it .  here , he is more of a wannabe serious actor ; an impostor .  jakob the liar will be compared with last year's life is beautiful because it is being marketed as a "" holocaust comedy "" .  it's not a comedy .  it tries , sometimes , but it rarely works .  is it a melodrama ?  a war movie ?  a character study ?  no , no , and no .  jakob the liar is the kind of movie that can't be placed into a category ; not because it covers so many different genres but because it fails at just about every one it attempts .

0|"it should have been a classic .  a great cast of respected supporting actors .  an interesting premise of loser comic book characters .  however , "" mystery men "" proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999 .  the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals .  the number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise .  the script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh-out-loud joke and mediocre small jokes , it failed miserably at being entertaining at all .  the jokes were not funny for a number of reasons .  they had been used a number of times before in previous films , the best ones , which were mediocre to begin with , were ruined in the trailer , and the expectation of laughing at clever , unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film .   "" mystery men "" might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business .  but with veterans doing this kind of junk , it really questioned whether their other work was as funny as originally thought .  thankfully most actors in this movie will appear in five other movies before the new year arrives to help viewers forget this little movie .  the film follows a band of wannabe superheroes living in a wannabe gotham city who are ridiculed by their fellow citizens and villains because of their clumsiness and failure to save they day and capture the bad guy .  the fact is these pathetic losers are not needed because their city already has a successful superhero , captain amazing , who has recently captured every evil-doer in the city .  captain amazing ( played terribly by an uninspired greg kinnear ) , because of his success in the past , is worried that he will lose popularity .  after freeing one of the most notorious bad guys in the city ( geoffrey rush , overacting just a bit too much ) to keep himself busy , things get out of hand when captain amazing is captured .  it is up to the wannabe superheroes to save the day .  by the time this section of the plot is finished , the interest for what happens ( if you haven't already figured it out ) is very low .  there are very few scenes which catch the viewers complete attention .  the first scene in the film , which shows the wannabes trying to save the day , feels like it was seriously edited down .  right when it was beginning to become slightly funny seeing these actors get humiliated at an old folk's home by some masked goons , captain amazing comes in and saves the day ? or ruins the movie .  instead of editing this scene , more editing should have been done in areas such as the unnecessary romance between mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and monica , a waitress ( claire forlani ) or the vast majority of the film , which is the heroes talking at a coffee table about how their day was .  a simple rule : more silly action is needed in order to make a silly action movie work .  another major problem with "" mystery men "" is that every actor in it seemed very uncomfortable and consequently gave terrible performances .  the film depended on its cast to work fluently together , like a bunch of old friends working together in an amiable reunion .  however , most characters seemed like they did not even want to be in this film or at least the script made it seem this way .  to pull one of the actors in this film randomly out of a hat , paul reubens , who disappeared from acting to everyone's joy , returns here leaving very little to be impressed about .  as a wannabe who uses flatulence for a weapon , all of his jokes must therefore be fart jokes .  fart jokes that have all been heard before and will inevitably be heard again in future films thanks to the success of "" american pie "" and "" there's something about mary . ""   "" mystery men "" drags on towards the end to a point where anything else in the world is more entertaining .  anyone with a brain knows each one of the heroes is going to be successful at their talent in the end and each one is going to contribute in a helpful way .  so why continue to watch ?  this film is far from a worthy guilty pleasure .   "" mystery men "" indeed does this and every time a character succeeds another one congratulates him and says "" i knew you could do it ! ""   "" mystery men "" fails in every category it attempts to pass .  what makes this film so bad is that it had the potential to be wonderful and unforgettable .  terrible acting , terrible script , and a terrible waste of time changes opinions about all of these actors .

0|"in my review of "" the spy who shagged me , "" i postulated an unbreakable law of film physics : every time a sequel is as good as or better than the previous film in the series , it is followed by a third movie that is a bore .  the cause is probably complacency ; a studio sighs with relief when part 2 lives up to expectations and figures part 3 is a sure thing .   "" scream 3 "" provides the latest proof of this rule .  in los angeles production has begun on "" stab 3 : return to woodsboro , "" the most recent installment in the series of movies inspired by the murders surrounding sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) .  however , life soon starts imitating art , and "" stab "" cast members turn up stabbed .  smelling yet another book deal , gale weathers ( courteney cox arquette ) comes to the set to investigate and finds her ex-boyfriend dewey riley ( david arquette ) acting as a technical consultant and getting chummy with jennifer ( parker posey ) , the actress playing gale in "" stab 3 . "" elsewhere , our heroine sidney is living in hiding under an assumed name .   .   .  until she gets a phone call from a familiar evil voice .  the late randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) makes a surprise guest appearance via video to explain the rules of a trilogy .  he notes the third chapter in a trilogy has an overabundance of exposition and a huge backstory to contend with .  indeed , "" scream 3 "" tries to link its murders back to the one that started it all , the murder of sidney's mother maureen before the beginning of the original "" scream . ""  at the scene of each murder in "" scream 3 , "" the killer leaves a photo of sidney's mother maureen as a teenager in hollywood and even includes a note claiming to be her real killer .  to find out who the killer is , our intrepid investigators have to uncover what happened during maureen's missing years when she was a starlet appearing in low-budget horror films .   ( even with that little information , you can probably already guess what the killer's relationship to sidney is ) .  unlike its predecessors , "" scream 3 "" doesn't have the guts to even suggest that the central characters might be the killer .  the characters we do suspect are all undeveloped , so that by the end we don't even care who the killer is .  the jaded detective ( patrick dempsey ) ?  the kinky producer ( lance henriksen ) ?  the driven young director ( scott foley ) ?  the ingenue ( emily mortimer ) ?  the character who turns out to be the killer seems to be selected at random .  wes craven supposedly filmed three different endings to keep the real one a secret , so it's quite possible the one in the final cut was randomly chosen .  the series' trademark references to other horror films have become trite and obvious .  possibly it's the absence of screenwriter kevin williamson , who penned the first two , or maybe it's that the hip ironic stance eventually consumes itself and a series that parodies film cliches eventually becomes a cliche .  i groaned as an attack on sidney from the first "" scream "" was repeated moment-for-moment in the hollywood set of her home .  at some point , referencing becomes just a means to cover up a poverty of new ideas .   "" scream 3 "" also continues the tradition of having an eclectic set of cameos and familiar faces in small roles .  look for jenny mccarthy , carrie fisher , patrick warburton ( puddy from "" seinfeld "" ) , roger corman , and jason mewes and kevin smith ( as jay and silent bob ) to walk through at some point .  all these bit players put forth more effort than the series' returning stars , who are probably saving their energy for the long post- "" scream "" job search .  another prediction i made in a previous review has come to pass : more movies are copying "" the blair witch project "" 's web strategy .   "" scream 3 "" has three official websites that ( wink , wink ) pretend that the events of the movie are real and provide additional backstory information not covered in the movie .  the sunrise studios site ( scream3 . com ) has trailers for other sunrise releases as well as the "" latest 'stab 3' news . ""  there's also a gail weathers official site ( galeweathers . com ) and a sunrise sucks site that has more "" stab "" scandals the studio wants to cover up ( sunrisesucks . com ) .  craven and company promise that this is the last installment in the "" scream "" series .  while i hope that's true , i don't hold out much hope-horror movie series are even harder to kill than their monsters .  there's a "" halloween h2k "" in the works , even though michael myers was beheaded in "" h20 , "" and a "" freddy vs . jason "" has been talked about for awhile , despite the fact that both characters were "" killed off .

0|"for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones , it is surprising to find the messenger : the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess .  in the early to mid 1400's , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman .  the church was a dismally dark and oppressive place .  france was involved in "" the hundred years war "" against england .  there was no strong political leadership in the country .  morale was low , there being little hope for the future .  it was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing "" voices "" and seeing "" visions . ""  convinced that these were messages from god , she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him .  the message : if he would give her an army to command , she would deliver to him the crown .  he does . . .  and she does .  then , once seated on the throne , he abandons her to her english captors .  director luc besson ( the fifth element ) may have co-wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material .  the inconsistencies of the cast , the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes , the inappropriate musical score , and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable .  his biggest miscue was to cast his wife , milla jovovich ( the fifth element ) in the title role .  ms . jovovich , looks spectacular as joan , clad in battle armor , astride a similarly protected horse .  if looks were enough to fully convey a character , she would have been brilliant .  since it isn't , she tried ( and failed ) to act the part .  her joan is unbalanced , "" inspiring "" the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed .  john malkovich ( being john malkovich ) fares a bit better as the dauphin , who joan would see on the throne as charles vii .  an easily manipulated man , his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death .  faye dunaway ( the thomas crown affair ) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin's mother-in-law and chief advisor .  the army under joan's command are comprised of comical figures , more stooges than soldiers .  the one exception would be tcheky karyo ( la femme nikita ) as dunois , the man who was leading the attack prior to joan's arrival .  trying to plan a systematic campaign , he sees his leadership authority negated by joan's insistence on following her "" visions .

( see jurrasic park . )  imgen , the company that funded jurrasic park , want to reccover their losses by taking more dinos off the other island and move them to a new attraction in san diago .  realizing what a bad idea this is , proffessor john hammond ( richard attenborough ) decides to send a team to document the dinosaurs , so as to rally public support to preserve the island .  enter familiar mumbling man jeff goldblum who only agrees to go when told his girlfriend is already there .  so , basically , what you have is this .  two teams , one sent to catch and move some dinosaurs to the mainland and the other , trying to document them , being forced to work together , fighting for survival against the dinosaurs' firm intentions on eating them .  a fairly good idea , however it's let down by one slight problem .  it's crap .  over two hours of chase scenes gets way too boring , way too quiclky .  add to this a terrible script and some feeble attempts at some occasional characterisation and you end up very disinterested .  it becomes background noise while your mind starts concentrating on things like , 'what's for tea ? ' and 'should you cut the lawn later ?

0|it's actually not so bad that dreamworks decided to release the love letter at about the same time as star wars episode i : the phantom menace , because this way less people will have to sit through this dreadful little comedy .  and no , i really don't feel guilty about wishing this movie death at the box-office .  really , i don't .  not at all .  the plot has been done before -- a mysterious , unaddressed love letter shows up in a small town , causing confusion for everyone who reads it .  the center of the ensuing disaster is bookstore owner helen ( kate capshaw , and by the way , what is it with bookstore owner main characters ?  in the past year and a half we've seen them in life is beautiful , you've got mail , this movie , and the upcoming notting hill ) , who finds the letter in between couch cushions in the bookstore .  she immediately starts testing other people to see who it might be from , and comes to the ( incorrect ) conclusion that the author of the note is a young employee played by tom everett scott .  he , reading the letter himself , assumes that she wrote it for him .  after a while , they fall in love ( well , duh ) .  kate feels guilty about getting in a relationship with someone more than twenty years younger than her , and she also feels guilty because at the same time she is also involved with the town fireman ( tom selleck ) .  to add to her turmoil , her mother shows up ( blythe danner , who apparently must have had her daughter when she was about 9 ) and her trusted bookstore manager ( deadpan ellen degeneres ) quits .  supporting characters aren't called supporting for nothing .  their purpose isn't just to move the plot along , they're also supposed to give the storyline a backbone .  to do this , they must exhibit at least marginal depth and must also be interesting .  rarely can a movie work if it puts an interesting protagonist in the middle and surrounds her with hackneyed , dull , cardboard secondary characters , especially when at the core of the movie is the protagonist's various interactions with them .  this is the love letter's damning error .  capshaw's character is as good as i have seen present in recent romantic comedies , but the people that surround her are all either underwritten or purely one-dimensional .  because of that , the love letter is awkward and insincere .  even worse -- it's a bore .  i liked capshaw and her helen , but everyone else is painfully fake , undermining the little drama or sexual tension that has the potential to exist .  there is nothing particularly hilarious about all this either -- and besides degeneres' wisecracks , there's little that is even a little amusing .  this is not a completely thoughtless film and director peter ho-sun chan does a good job of portraying helen's yearnings and various subtle complexities .  but it's far from profound .  there isn't a common theme running through the proceedings , thus the movie seems thoughtfully pointless .  really , this is a harmless little movie ; it's far from an abomination and it's not torturous to sit through .  but bad , it is .  awful , it also is .  the love letter is a failure , and an inane failure at that .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  |-0.5153333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.9|The movie is overall negatively perceived due to its dreadful, fake, and insincere nature, lack of developed characters, underwhelming humor, and being a bore, although it is acknowledged that it is not entirely terrible.

0|i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner  and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws .  but if you ask me , the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american .  or more the point , anyone that allows him to bask in his own less-than-subtle presence .  this is not an insult to gere , as i consider him to be a rather talented actor  but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role .  if a film is solely about one person , the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work .  although geres performance is in no way poorly acted , it is far from perfect  and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself .  this is where he truly belongs , and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear ( with the sensational edward norton ) , the jackal ( with bruce willis ) and pretty woman ( with the delightful julia roberts ) .  in red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore , who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear  bold and up front , who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind .  it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed , which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail .  it doesnt take long from the films beginning for jack moores charm to work on a pretty chinese lady , and in no time they are in bed together in a hotel room  drunk and cheerful .  yet instead of a hangover , poor jack finds himself covered in blood and the chinese chick dead on a couch .  he is arrested and hauled into a chinese prison .  his cell , food and rights  all terrible .  now trapped in a foreign land without adequate aid from the american embassy , lawyer shen yuelin ( bai ling ) defends his case by initially pleading guilty to the charge of murder .  jack and shen argue about their countries different laws ; shen stating that they will shoot you in the back and charge the cost of the bullet to your family .   as the plot thickens , scenes get progressively more ridiculous  ranging from richard gere running over rooftops in search of the us embassy to a scooby doo ending where the least expected but-you-knew-along criminal is discovered .  red corner is one of those films where you sneer , laugh or vomit youre way through all of its minutes .  what should have been a politically taunt thriller is little more than a pointless expedition to see how stressed out richard gere can act .  this is not to say that the film does not have its moments  there are some tense court room scenes that are shrewdly created  telling the tale of foreign injustice and government corruption .  but what they amount to spoils the effect of having them in the first place  perhaps this is why red corner is so frustrating to watch .  if you look at the films overall concept fairly broadly , the basic idea is quite tangible .  it is upon the films execution where the diminutive plot twists and developments fail to impress or innovate - the evidence that goes missing , the high powered officials shielding the truth and intolerable love angles have all been done so many times before .  if that wasnt bad enough , red corners dialogue is purely laughable on many occasions .  shen yuelin attempts to gain sympathy by reciting renaissance of a destitute relationship with her deceased father , whilst jack moore is eager to talk about chinese musical instruments when he could have been working on a plan to free himself .  taking itself far too seriously , red corner is not half the film it intends to be .  although it would have benefited from the help of a more valuable supporting cast , the films main fault is in the bizarre ( and often out of place ) way of unfolding a story which isnt that meritorious anyway .  whilst richard gere still proves that has what it takes to be known as a decent actor , i would think twice before going to see him attempt to manage such a serious yet hollow drama again .  martin vailwhere are you ?  |-0.27999999999999997|0.7666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment of the text is negative, as the author expresses disappointment with the film ""Red Corner,"" criticizes Richard Gere's performance, and points out flaws in the plot, dialogue, and execution."

"" baywatch "" babe pamela anderson lee proves once and for all that she should keep her double-d's on the small screen .  at least there you don't have to pay to see her cleavage .  and for those viewers out there who would only lay down money for this movie in hopes of seeing pam topless , hate to burst your bubble , but there are no full-fledged nude scenes in barb wire .  you wouldn't be reading this review right now if i had known that fact going in .  i can't go back in time and reverse my mistake , but i can warn other horny teenage boys out there .  they do tease us a few times with scenes where you almost see her topless but if she is nude , it's so quick you can't even tell for sure whether you're seeing her andersons or not .  a nipple hallucination sort of thing .  barb wire was adapted from a comic book , interesting because pamela is probably the only woman who looks like a comic book character in real life , even wearing low-cut leather to do office work ( businesswoman bondage wear ) and having unreal body proportions .  yes , like the mona lisa , pamela anderson is a man-made beauty , probably in more senses than one .  she is a definite beauty , though , and looking at her is never an unpleasant experience .  you'd just think the woman who began her career as a playboy playmate wouldn't have any reservations about appearing nude in the movie , because it's obvious she wasn't pulling a sharon stone and trying to make people pay attention to her acting skills .  i mean , she shows off more cleavage here than a jeweler's convention .  the movie is set in the year 2017 , "" the worst year of my life , "" pam says .   ( "" the worst movie of the year , "" i say . )  america is going through a second civil war and pamela is a nightclub owner in the only free city in the nation ( silicone valley , i think ) .  she also hires herself out as a bounty hunter when the price is right , posing as first a stripper and later as a prostitute .  but don't call her "" babe . ""  she hates that , and reminds us of that fact way too many times .  imagine , a woman who does a trapeze strip tease in a bar while having a hose sprayed on her being referred to in such a sexist , demeaning term .  a liberated woman like pamela anderson shouldn't have to hear words like "" babe "" during a strip tease , especially since that movie about the talking pig was such a success .  the plot ( ha-ha ) revolves around a pair of contact lenses that allow their wearer to pass through the congressional directorate's retina scanners .  in the words of one of the characters , they're "" more than meets the eye . ""  reminds me of the "" transformers "" cartoon , and i sure wished the movie could somehow be transformed into something decent , but that never happened .  no , the movie just continued on its path of lame action scenes starring pamela van-damme , big-busted kickboxer , and her resistance accomplices , ex-boyfriend axel ( tamuera morrison ) and cora ( victoria rowell ) .  thank god they didn't name her cora reef .  one bad character name is more than enough .  pamela originally doesn't take sides , giving some speech about she's only loyal to the money they pay her , but she changes her mind once the congressional bastards kill her blind brother , jack noseworthy of bon jovi "" always "" video fame .  i still don't know if barb wire is a step up or step down for noseworthy , but he definitely is nose worthy ( even if he isn't sponge worthy ) .  pam gets ready to avenge his death by grabbing up an armful of semi-automatic weapons and strapping an ammunitions belt to her chest .  it's not rambo . . .  it's bimbo !  mark my words , barb wire will be all over the cinemax network in a year .  it's got all the elements of the direct-to-video releases featured on hbo's bastard cousin , the cable channel i'd never watch if it didn't somehow come free .  it's got the non-titillating scenes of voyeurism , laughable flashbacks , bad dialogue and action cliches out the wazzoo .  there's even a narrator at the beginning setting up the movie's premise while the words scroll up the screen .  someone needs to tell pamela the wookie this ain't star wars .  if you've seen any action flick of the past fifteen years , you'll recognize plenty of lifted elements .  barb wire has the obligatory trucks flipping over , car crashes , explosions , broken glass and slow-motion shots of bodies falling hundreds of feet to their death .  this is one of those automatic-pilot movies anyone could write or direct .  barb wire has only two things going for it . . .  and i think you know what those two things are .

0|"part buddy comedy , part fish-out-of-water story , part nature tale , meet the deedles is not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes .  in fact , it is an invitation you ought to disregard .  phil and stew deedle ( paul walker and steve van wormer ) are the twin sons of the famous millionaire , elton deedle ( eric braeden ) , founder of deedle enterprises .  elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his fortune . . . instead  the two are careless hawaiian surf bums .  to set them straight , he enrolls them into a strict wyoming boot camp , to which the pair inevitably go .  after several misadventures in wyoming , where the duo is stunned to discover there's no surf , the brothers deedle stumble upon a routine mistaken identity plot .  they arrive at yellowstone national park , where they are believed to be two new park ranger recruits .  rather than slinking back home and disappointing their dad , the deedles play along .  phil , actually , has other motives : the beautiful park ranger jesse ( a .  j . langer ) , who unfortunately happens to be the beloved stepdaughter of the overprotective park ranger captain douglas pine ( john ashton ) .  yellowstone has a problem .  it's only a week before the famous geyser old faithful celebrates its one billionth birthday , and the park is being overrun with prairie dogs .  not just one or two . . . thousands of them .  the deedles are assigned to eliminate the p . dog menace , not knowing that it all is part of a fiendish plan by disgraced former head ranger frank slater ( dennis hopper ) .  the brothers deedle aren't supposed to be out-and-out stupid , like the team from dumb and dumber , or bill and ted .  instead , their brains just operate in a different , simpler , realm .  a more accurate comparison would be with carrot top in chairman of the board , a film which , unfortunately , this one resembles in several hideous ways .  the central problem with meet the deedles is that it simply just isn't funny .  there's a moment when phil utters the line , "" insert laugh here "" , which nearly sums up the entire meet the deedles experience .  the result isn't bad in a run-shrieking-from-the-theater type of way .  instead , it's merely bad in an excruciatingly boring sort of way .  the cast seems decent , but they're never asked to do anything remotely interesting .  instead , the film inundates the audience with countless shots of people and/or cars rolling downhill in the forest , and with constant annoying references to other disney films .  you'll have much better luck finding a good spot to surf in wyoming than finding entertainment in meet the deedles .

"" tomb raider "" sets up elaborate action set pieces , then renders them incomprehensible with needless jump cut editing ( a promising dual bungee cord battle is ruined by excessive cuts ) .  it promises a series of exotic locales , then delivers cavernous sets and grimy matte paintings with smoggy skies .  throw in some bargain basement computer graphics and you end up with the ugliest movie to come down the pike in many moons .  intended to be a rousing "" indiana jones "" style adventure , "" tomb raider "" lacks any sense of tension .  the low point comes when lara is "" threatened "" by statues of monkey warriors and a giant multi-armed shiva figure that come to life courtesy of cgi .  easily the lamest menaces i have ever seen , the creatures move like snails and fall apart with a single shot from a gun .  if you ever have to be chased by monsters , pray that you get the monkey warriors .
