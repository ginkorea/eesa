[on a side note , gary sinise wins this week's "" title ! ""  award , as he's the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings .  last week's winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards . ]  how to take your bad idea and make things worse : include two or three plot twists that , instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent , make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely .  this is a bad movie .  and what's worse is that , except for a few moments near the not-so-stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous , reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad .  if they'd done that much , at least i would have been entertained .

0|"the tagline for this film is : "" some houses are just born bad "" .  so i didn't expect too much from this .  but i had preserved a little spark of ope as i entered the theatre .  i thought : liam neeson , cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont .  i thought , mabe it will be fun ?  and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing .  but by the end of it i thought : why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones , jan de bont ? .  these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality .  here is the story : in the monstrously over-decorated mansion known as hill house , visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor ( liam neeson ) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation .  among them is a sophisticated bisexual ( cathrine zeta jones ) , a cynical dope ( owen wilson ) and a gentle and emotional lady ( lily taylor ) .  actually , the doctor is researching the "" primordial fear reaction "" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch !  what happens .  but he gets unexpected help from the house itself .  it rumbles , hums and belches forth remarkable sights .  portals become veiny stained-glass eyeballs .  a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth .  filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains .  but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real , placing an emotional wall between audience and screen .  the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture .  is that exciting or what ?  the worst thing about it is that it didn't have to be bad .  it's based on a great book , ``the haunting of hill house , '' by shirley jackson .  a 1963 adaptation of the book was scary and intelligent .  it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience .   "" the blair witch project "" , that cost less than an old car , managed to shock and terrify the audiences from their senses .  and with a $70 mill .  budget , de bont and screenwriter david self make hash out of a perfectly lovely piece of terror .  de !  bont has a style of filmmaking so out of line with the material that it is , in itself , frightening .  he is the master of the extravagant special effect and the big visual adrenaline rush .  but why give him a more serious material ?  in the end "" haunting "" will only haunt its fledgling studio ( dream works skg ) and de bont's career as a director .  yet it wouldn't be fair to say that everything is bad .  the effects are truly impressive and the house is wonderfully decorated -- beautiful , mysterious , magical and spooky .  but this is where the good things end .  the music is blaring , the floors moving , the ceiling morphing and the pictures on the walls screaming -- and all of this , every second , every moment of screen time , is absolutely without life .  it's nothing more than a special effects-extravaganza ; visually impressive , but intellectually hollow thriller that simply doesn't engage .  at first you do not know what's going on .  is this part of the experiment ?  are these hallucinations ?  projections of the subconscience ?  paranoia ?  but in the end it shows out that this is actually happening .  the house is actually possessed .  it is at that point when all your hopes for a good entertainment disappears out of the window .  for ever , i sat in anticipation for a decent climax and that's what i got ?  i believe hichock once said that "" it's !  better to wait for a climax , than to see one "" .  this may be true , and it might actually work , but there is only one problem -- jan de bont is not hichock and the things that he shows are not scary , only stupid .  they are impossible to take seriously .  any paralells that you might have heard before , linking this picture to kubrick's "" the shining "" , are absolutely baseless .   "" shining "" had class , style , story , acting , but most of all talent and originality .   "" haunting "" has only special effects and art direction to boast of .  and those elements alone are not enough to make it a good film .  casting good actors for small , pale parts only makes things worse .  but i guess that no matter what i or other critics say or write , most of you will see this film anyway , even if the tagline would say : "" some films are just born stupid "" .

0|"the title is taken from the writings of ralph waldo emerson describing the life of a traveler as 'anywhere but here . '  there isn't one thing about this mother-daughter relationship melodrama that felt honest .  it relies on a contrived minor character to tell both mother and daughter what was obvious to do in order to straighten out their dysfunctional lives , as for some reason they couldn't figure it out for themselves .  if the film looks familiar , that is because "" the slums of beverly hills ( 98 ) "" went over the same ground but was fortunate to be more comical and perceptive due to alan arkin and natasha lyonne performances , in which they were fortunate to have a much sharper script to work with .  alvin sargent's script was weak and annoyingly claustral .  wayne wang's ( "" the joy luck club "" ) inept direction made a weak script even weaker by his inability to tell the story unfolding without the voiceover relating what the action couldn't convey .  pushy mother adele august ( susan sarandon ) forces her 14-year-old daughter ann ( natalie portman ) to leave a small midwestern burg to go cross-country with her to beverly hills .  the daughter resents her twice divorced , unstable but exotic , schoolteacher mother , bullying her to be an actress as a means of escaping a humdrum life .  the daqughter doesn't even like the used gold mercedes mother buys to drive to lala land in and can't stand the beach boys records mom enjoys hearing on the car radio .  so it becomes a question of who knows best , as the ladies fight it out between them , until the predictable sweet ending comes in this yawner .  adele's dream of greener pastures in beverly hills soon doesn't look that good , as she lands a job in a slum school , has her precious car scratched by the unruly kids , and settles into a job she hates in order to financially survive .  daughter pines for small town wisconsin and her friends there .  during one of many arguments with her free-spirited mom , they go for ice cream and while mother is being ticketed , she runs away , only to be chased down by friendly traffic cop ( michael milhoan ) , who offers her wise counsel .  with the cop's zen wisdom passed onto the daughter , she will survive living in many different addresses in beverly hills until she reaches 17 and then she plans to get way from mom by using her good grades to go to brown university instead of ucla .  during their stay in beverly hills , she grows from feeling awkward in beverly hills high to immediately having many high school girlfriends and even a high school rich boy admirer-- a t . s .  eliot ( corbin allred ) reader .  but the transition of her life into beverly hills had no feel of reality , as everything seemed staged and unemotional .  when she learns her cousin benny ( shawn hatosy ) , who happens to be her best friend dies in a traffic accident back in wisconsin , she returns for the funeral and in those reunion scenes it wasn't clearly shown why she wants to stay there , and for that matter , it was never made clear why the mother wants to leave so badly .  the film is one big battle of wills between mother and daughter over their dreams .  i guess what the filmmaker is trying to say , is that mom is a bad dreamer and the daughter is the observant one , able to recognize mother's faults when not in growing pains and in need of parenting herself .  mother has a series of setbacks , like being dumped by her dream-boat dentist ( bochner ) she met on the beach , and witnessing her daughter mimic her whiny optimistic sayings when trying out for an acting part .  but mother learns that her daughter has grown-up and is independent and that she has to stop living her life through her .  she learns this when the same wise cop who told ann what to do , is about to ticket her and this time will remind the mother of the right thing to do .  this of course results in the corny ending , showing that mom's heart was always in the right place , only she went about it in the wrong way .  this was just one of those films where you want to be anywhere but in the theater where this film is showing .

0|walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox's anastasia .  but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios , the visuals are the only thing fox has to brag about .  disney's recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and to a lesser extent , hercules .  with anastasia , fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window .  some may say - so what ?  it's just a kid's movie .  well . . .  if you have young kids , beware , as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse-rotting rasputin zombie , whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way .  consider yourselves warned .  nevertheless , the animation is quite stunning at times .  don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout , occasionally rivalling photographic quality .  and yet in other scenes , the hand-drawn material seems of the saturday-morning tv crowd , which leads me to wonder . . .  was this rushed to market to combat disney ?  the plot , as anyone who had read history before knows , concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916 .  not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened .  as for the plot --- go rent disney's candleshoe .  you'll see 60% of anastasia there .  |-0.4666666666666666|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|The explanations suggest that the sentiment overall leans towards the negative side as the text criticizes aspects of the film such as the animation and plot, while acknowledging the stunning animation.

0|"here's something to chew on : what's the favorite food of big , cheesy-looking special effects monsters like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising ?  the obvious answer to this question is cardboard , because that's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature .  deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer .  in fact , considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas , perhaps it was .  the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore .  not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh ( both human and non-human ) been scattered in all directions .  we learn some bloody trivia , as well , such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red ( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains ) and what it does with half-digested leftovers .  i suppose deep rising's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre , but it doesn't do much for me .  on the surface , and that's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed , deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic ( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/titanic connection , since james cameron directed both ) .  in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue-in-cheek mayhem of tremors , deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin .  the film is not humorous , tense , or exciting .  in fact , it's downright boring , and , despite being half the length of cameron's current box-office champ , deep rising feels like the longer movie .  is it really necessary to say anything about the plot ?  probably not , since it's easy to guess , but i'll go ahead and oblige anyone who wants a synopsis .  the film opens by introducing us to a gang of bad guys on board a mercenary ship .  in addition to the usual cast of psychopaths and lunatics , there's finnegan ( treat williams ) , the boat's pilot , who's supposed to be an indiana jones knockoff ; joey ( kevin j . o'connor ) , the inept sidekick who's supposed to be lovable and funny ( but is really just irritating ) ; and hanover ( wes studi ) , the "" mastermind "" ( and i use that term lightly ) of the operation .  their goal : attack a cruise ship , clean out the safe , then sink it using some illegally-acquired torpedoes .  the problem is , by the time they reach the argonautica , the titanic-like luxury liner has turned into the marie celeste .  aside from a beautiful jewel thief ( famke janssen ) and a couple of crew members , there's no one on board .  the reason soon becomes obvious -- the ship has been taken over by a bad special effect that is supposed to resemble an octopus with teeth and more than eight tentacles .  the cast , which is led by treat williams , is primarily comprised of has-beens and probably-never-will-bes ( two exceptions : wes studi , best known as the villain in the last of the mohicans , and djimon hounsou , amistad's cinque ) .  williams , once a "" can't miss "" prospect in hollywood , has fallen so far out of favor that the best he can do these days for a lead role is a film like deep rising , and his inability to create a charismatic or interesting figure here may sink whatever is left of his sputtering career .  famke janssen , who will forever be known as xenia onatopp from goldeneye , is the perfect bland match for williams .  given her limited acting abilities , it's likely that she was chosen for this part primarily on the basis of her physical attributes .  unfortunately , a bra defeats the purpose of having her in a wet tee-shirt for half of the picture .  meanwhile , kevin j . o'connor , who has entirely too much screen time , exhibits all the appeal of fingernails scratching a blackboard .  these days , audiences are becoming more difficult to impress with computer-generated special effects .  this is a lesson that writer/director stephen sommers ( who previously helmed the live-action jungle book ) needs to learn .  the days of jurassic park , when viewers were astounded by the mere spectacle of seeing something big and imposing on screen , are past .  now , movie-goers are looking for the sophistication of titanic -- visuals that are so well-incorporated that it's impossible to tell where they end and where "" reality "" begins .  in deep rising , the monster , like everything , is artificial and unconvincing .  unfortunately , the fundamental problem audiences are faced with here isn't so much the idiotic monotony of this individual picture , but the poor quality of the entire bankrupt genre ( although , to be fair , deep rising is a particularly bad entry ) .  even once this film has sunk out of sight , the knowledgeable viewer knows it won't be the last of its kind .  like the slimy , slithering things that inhabit the air vents and pipes of these movies , more are waiting just around the corner in ambush .  and that consideration , unlike anything on screen , is truly horrifying .

0|"this is an adaptation of h . g . wells' acclaimed novel 'the invisible man' .  the actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue .  the director is paul verhoven .  that , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre .  the problem is to keep us there .  i can't imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time .  working on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself "" god "" , has discovered the secret to invisibility .  the first two faces are completed .  now , it is time for "" the next logical step "" -- human .  caine volunteers for this risky experiment .  but when he is made invisible , something goes wrong .  while his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower .  but that's not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania .  he is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine .  soon every sense of decency is forgotten .  the little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody .  though it's based on a novel called 'the invisible man' , the title has been ironically changed to 'hollow man' that sums up the film very nicely .  this is a very silly production .  laughable , actually .  apparently verhoven's imagination doesn't stretch too far .  for him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls' locker room undetected .  it is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie .  being invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society .  in many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences .  the nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about .  all that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat .  caine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man .  but since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn't stop there .  he becomes a rapist .  and then , of course , a murderer .  you'll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place .  shue's talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent .  kevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully .  his face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice .  there are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing .  in the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place .  being probably the best technical achievement since "" jurassic park "" , they are absolutely amazing .  we observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible .  we see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood .  there are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ?  what is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more .  pretty much like jan de bont ( "" twister "" , "" haunting "" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary .  he was responsible for several good films ( "" basic instinct "" and "" starship troopers ) "" and some incredibly bad films ( "" showgirls "" , "" total recall "" ) , but he has never made anything that was great .  in a way "" hollow man "" fits perfectly in this collection .  it's not better or worse than verhoven's average film .  he proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues .  and so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot's of dull action with blood and naked bodies .  he even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc . - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you'll be screaming "" nooooo ! ""  and attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) .  and all we can ask is why ?  the answer is simple .  though hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money .  it has to be about telling stories , not marketing them .  it has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness .  to make us care , to make us think and feel .  verhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that .  it's all flesh and bones , but no soul .  a void where its imagination should be .

0|"eddie murphy has a lot riding on harlem nights .  as the movie's writer , director , executive producer , and star , murphy will shoulder all of the blame if harlem nights fails .  but at the same time , he'll receive all of the credit if it succeeds .  should you sacrifice your hard-earned cash to support murphy's risky gamble ?  well , that depends on whom you trust more : me or eddie murphy .  here's what murphy thinks : "" i think the audience is expecting a good time .  they gonna get sexy .  they gonna get funny .  they gonna get drama .  they gonna get all of that .  i think it's the best movie i've done "" ( paramount radio network ) .  here's what i think : harlem nights is charmless , unoriginal , disappointing , and almost without question , the worst film of the actor's career ( i haven't seen best defense ) .  and guess who's to blame ? !  the movie's problem is not murphy's direction : harlem nights is a fairly good looking film .  no , the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled .  murphy's awful script is the culprit .  let's count the mistakes he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting :   ( 1 ) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture .  yes , he even outdoes his own work in raw .  practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word .  and after 15 minutes , it gets irritating .   ( 2 ) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast .  richard pryor , redd foxx , michael lerner , and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes .  each of them shines occasionally , but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle .   ( 3 ) the movie demeans women by depicting them solely as sexual objects and as pawns in power struggles between men .  murphy has admitted in interviews that he is weary of women in his private life , which is really neither here nor there .  but when murphy puts his bitter feelings on 3 , 000 movie screens across the country , it's another matter altogether .  you're forced to swallow some pretty gruesome stuff .  for instance , murphy punches della reese in the stomach .  and he shoots jasmine guy in the head .  this is a mean-spirited movie , folks !  lovely newcomer lela rochon gets off easy in her role as a common whore , but only because she doesn't have any scenes with murphy .  thank god : he might have run her over with a bulldozer .   ( 4 ) murphy has written for himself perhaps his blandest role to date .  the loveable eddie murphy charisma emerges only once or twice during the film .  murphy would rather give his character a spiffy wardrobe than a spiffy personality .  sometimes it seems as if murphy made harlem nights just so he could wear fancy suits and look debonair .   ( 5 ) the plot is a shameless rip-off of the sting .  if you're going to make another sting movie , you've got to do something original .  murphy's tale of warring nightclub owners in harlem ( circa 1938 ) fails to add anything new to the formula .   ( 6 ) to get laughs , murphy makes fun of stuttering .  you know a comedy is digging deep when it resorts to ridiculing the handicapped .   ( 7 ) murphy's idea of drama is a scene in which his character apologizes for the first time in his life .  for what ?  for shooting reese's little toe off !  needless to say , murphy shows little , if any , promise or imagination as a screenwriter .  in all fairness , however , a few rays of sunshine do manage to break through the gloomy cloud surrounding the movie .  danny aiello is fun to watch as a dirty cop on the take .  aiello stands out in the large , ensemble cast : he obviously relishes the opportunity to play such a nasty character ( a racist detective with mob ties ) .  aiello's zesty performance gives harlem nights some much needed spice .  another bright spot is arsenio hall , who has a hilarious , show-stopping cameo as a cry-baby gangster ; hall virtually steals the spotlight from murphy .  in fact , hall's ten minutes on screen are the funniest ten minutes in the movie .  unfortunately , his character is completely irrelevant to the plot ; murphy should have given hall a much bigger role .  of course , i've already mentioned that i didn't care for murphy's character , but i have to admit that i did love his neckties .  they are simply spectacular--almost worth the price of admission .

0|"because no one demanded it : david duchovny in a romantic comedy !  at last , both his romantic magnetism and his comedic brilliance are mined for all their resources !  the choice of duchovny may have something to do with the plot , which could be fodder for a valentine's day episode of "" the x-files .

0|"let me begin by saying that this is easily the worst movie in the entire official ( and even unofficial ) james bond series .  it is so full of self-parody and silly characters that you would almost believe you were watching a spoof .  an omen of what is to come is provided by the pre-credits sequence , a dull affair featuring a confrontation between a man ( it's difficult to give a better description since no mention of him is made elsewhere in the movie ) and the assassin of the title .  a song with woefully terrible lyrics follows , and the rest of the movie is even worse .  the plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule-the-world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s , but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin , francisco scaramanga ( christopher lee , putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie ) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore's 007 .  there is also a flimsy connection with the energy crisis and a missing solar cell with 95% efficiency .  it's as much of a mess as it sounds .  bond is "" helped "" in his task by mary goodnight ( ekland ) , whose character couldn't possibly be any closer to the stereotypical bimbo .  during the course of the movie she gets locked in both a closet and a car trunk , blunders around a control room accidentally setting off a laser and serves no purpose in enhancing the plot whatsoever .  maud adams ( later to star in octopussy ) is a much more stronger and useful character , but she hardly features in the movie .  scaramanga's lackey is a dwarf called nik-nak , who rather fittingly is also possibly the silliest henchman in the series , serving up annoyance and weak dialogue in equal measures .  worse still is an almost total lack of action throughout the whole movie .  there is but one fight sequence about fifteen minutes in ( not counting a ludicrous scene where two teenage girls beat up several dozen trained martial artists -- another misguided attempt at humour ) .  the solitary car chase might have been a highlight , but the "" action "" is interrupted on a frequent basis by a redneck sheriff ( j . w .  pepper , played by clifton james of live and let die "" fame "" ) yelling stupid comments out of the passenger window .  he is easily the most irritating character in a james bond movie .  even his presence could have been made bearable by one of the most impressive car stunts in cinematic history , a 360 degree twisting loop jump over a broken bridge -- could have been , except somebody got the idea to dub a mocking whistle tone over the final print .  on top of that debacle , the whole end of the film is an anticlimatic sequence in scaramanga's "" funhouse "" .  the only good thing that came out of this movie was that the producers had to make the next film in the series ( the infinitely superior "" the spy who loved me "" ) a great film in order for the bond franchise to survive .

0|"since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993's steven spielberg drama "" schindler's list "" and directed 1993's intelligent "" searching for bobby fischer , "" his new film , "" a civil action , "" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career .  what doesn't make sense is how such high-profile and superb actors as john travolta , robert duvall , william h . macy , and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project , which is both dull and completely ineffective .  the film , which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia , certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally-charged , but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings , leaving us with nothing more than a poorly-done courtroom drama .  based on a book by jonathan hart , which was consequently based on a true account , "" a civil action "" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn , mass . , where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann ( john travolta ) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children's death from leukemia due to unknown causes .  jan originally decides to drop the case , but when he stumbles across to corporate giants , grace and beatrice foods , who have plants located near the families' homes , he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place : the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which , thus , goes into the city's drinking water .  suddenly , after hearing about the families' heartbreak and personal stories , he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery , even though he is warned by his staff accountant ( william h . macy ) that no money is coming in to them , only going out .  also figuring into the story is jerome facher ( robert duvall ) , beatrice foods' corporate counsel , who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his $20-million offer to settle the case .  coming from such a talented writer , director , and cast , not to mention one of the most interesting film composers , danny elfman , "" a civil action "" is an astoundingly empty-headed drama , one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience .  perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture , zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning .  watching the film , i couldn't help but notice its similarities with 1997's far , far superior film "" the sweet hereafter , "" which dealt with a lawyer , played brilliantly by ian holm , investigating a school bus accident that killed a number of children .  in his attempts to find someone who may have been responsible for the accident , holm interviews the grieving parents , as well as the sole surviving passenger , a teenage girl , which starts to remind him of his own teenage daughter , a young drug-addict who has run away from home .  not only was the plotting similar to "" a civil action , "" but it also had the same exact running time of 115 minutes .  considering this , it is amazing how fulfilling and truthful "" a sweet hereafter "" was , not only concentrating on the school bus accident , but delving deeply into ian holm's character and his own personal demons , as well as the teenage girl .  in "" a civil action , "" however , i have no idea where the running time went , since the film is virtually two hours of nothingness .  we do not get to know the parents very well , nor any of the main characters .  through its whole duration , i did not learn one thing__not one thing__about travolta's lawyer character , jan schlictmann , who doesn't appear to have any sort of life or purpose outside of his job .  every scene is tediously related directly to the premise , and therefore , there was no one for me to care about or root for .  you've got to work pretty hard , actually , to not get an audience to become involved in the parents' plight , since their children are dead , but that is exactly what "" a civil action "" does .  to be honest , i would be fairly hard-pressed to state an aspect of the film that i actually liked .  aside from one flashback to when a man's young son died on the way to the doctor , i remained unmoved and passive about what was going on in the scenes , and more than once found my mind wandering .  i could say the performances were good , but who's fooling who ?  since every character is one-dimensionally written , no one's acting abilities are challenged in any way .  travolta plays a lawyer well enough , but that's about all he does .  duvall virtually sleepwalks through his role , apparently only appearing to give one-liners at every chance he gets .  and what in the world is kathy bates doing in the picture's final scene , as a judge ?  she appears unbilled , since it is just a cameo , but why did she even agree to do it in the first place ?  finally , when the conclusion arrived and the end credits began to role , the film left me with another question : what was the point ?  abruptly ending without any susceptible momentum , where none came before that to begin with , "" a civil action "" seemed to me , at least , to be an example of how not to make a courtroom drama , and it certainly did not do justice to the very serious subject matter the film deals with .

0|"synopsis : al simmons , top-notch assasin with a guilty conscience , dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell .  making a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell's army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape .  sullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn's attention .  comments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the "" spider-man "" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn .  mcfarlane's "" spawn "" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s .  mcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max .  the early "" spawn "" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane's genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing .  with the popularity of "" spawn "" and the success of the current warner bros . 's batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn .  in the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series .  this topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark .  what happened ?  why is spawn so bad ?  todd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo .  i don't think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film .  i place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology .  these films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc . spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics .  hardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons .  a lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don't get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren't engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath ) .  spawn's translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level .  mcfarlane's spawn was a tortured hero .  a mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda .  having died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda .  simmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married .  despite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn't help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld .  spawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so .  when the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching .  the cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters .  spawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman ) .  john leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second .  i ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator .  the film , however , spends so much time on the violator's offensive antics that they grate on the nerves .  apparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator's lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave .  leguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film .  michael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on .  more time needed to be spent on white's character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings .  a special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn .  easily the hammiest performance in the movie , it's hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now .  sheen's excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film .  many other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down .  mtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them .  flames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting .  cogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film .  he goofily tells the audience , at one point , that "" how much of [spawn's] humanity is left remains to be seen , "" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another .  the music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue .  loud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes .  to be fair , however , marilyn manson's "" long hard road out of hell "" effectively compliments spawn's return to earth , while filter and the crystal method's "" ( can't you ) trip like i do "" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song .  for as good a comic book as it is , "" spawn "" did not spawn a good movie .  spawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development .  it receives two stars for its technically well-done special effects .  many other films , though , have equal , if not superior , special effects and are much better .  rated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r-rated movies and probably wouldn't be appropriate for the very young .

0|"i can't recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota .  for forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt .  then , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another .  feeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face .  feeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him .  red's punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie's dreams .  enter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam's estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie's eye and have sex with her in the bathroom .  united in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn't ready to let them go without a fight .  freddie , meanwhile , isn't ready to let sam's money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations .  there is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam's intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father .  it does a great job of setting up jjaks' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves' wounded look is just right for jjaks .  the wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin .  most important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements' "" i will dare "" on the car radio .  you would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota .  unfortunately , you would be dead wrong .  i suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn't expect what i got .  what i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality .  suddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable .  the sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations .  vincent d'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood .  there are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme's something wild and neil jordan's the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn't try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment .  i don't want to dismiss baigelman's successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper .  it _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can't make his two halves into a whole .  feeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there's not much funny about that .

0|"wolfgang petersen's latest , the perfect storm , is like a pineapple .  it only tastes good after arduous peeling and digging - if you try to eat the fruit , spikes and all , it's going to hurt ? quite a bit .  ok , maybe that was a confusing analogy , so here's my main complaint about the latest man battles nature flick : there isn't really much of a story to tell .  basically , a massachusetts fishing crew goes out to sea on a small boat , called the andrea gail , and gets stuck in the middle of "" the storm of the century . ""  how much time does it take for petersen to tell this story ?  not nearly enough .  so he spends the majority of the film developing pointless side stories which all eventually become superfluous .  audiences want to see the storm , they want to see a fight for survival but what they get is a lot of cliched , maudlin drivel .  the last quarter of the perfect storm is utterly perfect in every aspect , but just try lasting the first three-quarters .  i have yet to read sebastian junger's the perfect storm , but from what i have heard it is an unforgettable tale .  based on a true story , the book must have found some other way to introduce the characters because in the movie version , the approach is weak .  using a wonderfully patriotic score by james horner , petersen almost hides the in-your-face banality .  right away the central characters are introduced : the gritty , determined captain ( george clooney ) , the ingenue ( mark wahlberg ) torn between his job and his girlfriend ( diane lane ) , the loving father ( john c . reilly ) , the comic relief who's always trying to get laid ( john hawkes ) , the new guy ( william fichtner ) who immediately antagonizes a crewmate and the quiet , french guy ( allen payne ) .  so many problems strike the opening segment of the film that the remaining portions directly suffer .  it is not the all-star cast's fault , just the characters designed for their portrayal .  allen payne's character never speaks in the entire movie , not because he is mute , but because he's never given any lines !  are we supposed to root for a guy whose face and voice we are never given a chance to interact with ?  fichtner's character is terribly underdeveloped - we don't know what he's doing there , where he's from , or who he's supposed to be .  the remaining four fishermen are all cardboard stereotypes ( hawkes says to a female stranger in one scene "" you know what would look good on you ?  me ! ""  ooooh real creative ) .  as the script advances and the andrea gail floats farther out into the waters , the crew continues to not feel human .  only when the storm takes center stage does the movie jump out of its sleepwalk .  the computer-generated images of gigantic waves crashing against a helpless boat are thunderously real .  i can only imagine if this was an imax film , this city kid would surely never go in the water again .  this is loud , jolting entertainment - adjectives that completely negate the rest of the film .  the perfect storm was unfortunately a disappointment .  the maelstrom lived up to its potential but everything else failed to do so .  i guess i'll stick to that other survival spectacle ? you know the one on cbs ?

"" alan smithee "" is a pseudonym which a number of directors have used when they produce something really bad .  frankly , i'd be embarrassed if i had directed this turkey , so i think i understand why the director might have picked the "" alan smithee "" moniker for this film .  where to begin with this painfully poor thriller ?  let's start with the acting .  it's pretty bad .  amanda peterson plays valerie and shows at least some talent ( the rest of the cast don't ) , even though her performance isn't exactly stellar material .  she's also miscast ; she seems way too old to still have a year of high school to complete .  her scenes with valerie's mother , played by mary frann , are a joke .  the two look as though they're a couple of coworkers going out to lunch together , rather than a daughter with her mother who just doesn't understand .  christopher atkins , a handsome enough actor who plays the killer , adam , looks like a clown in the second half of fatal charm .  trying to appear malicious and dangerous , he wears large sunglasses and a half-buttoned jacket .  if disney decided to do a zany comedy caper about the unabomber , atkins would probably be a perfect candidate for the lead , but he doesn't cut it here .  early on in the movie , a number of scenes occurs in a courtroom .  outside of the laughably poor performances given by the actors portraying lawyers , the people sitting in the benches provide the silliest effort at drama in the film .  they constantly shift and turn and arc their heads in mock interest in what has got to be one of the worst perfomances that a large group of people have given at one time ever .  fatal charm's storyline , such as it is , inspires more yawns than thrills .  the script belabors a red herring , early on , about a second suspect who may have committed the murders for which adam ( atkins ) is charged with .  this suspect , however , turns up strangled and drowned halfway through the film : an obvious plot fault .  even for the idiots who didn't consider the movie's title as valerie and a blond newsreporter commented how innocent and charming the defendant seemed , it becomes quite obvious that adam is dangerous when the other suspect washes up .  so , the audience must wait ( if they haven't already stopped watching ) as the necessary details fall into place and the killer goes after the heroine in the drawn-out finale .  the video box for this dud describes fatal charm as an "" erotic thriller "" .  a thriller it isn't , and neither is it particularly erotic .  i can't imagine , if someone were in the mood for something "" erotic , "" that he'd be happy after watching this fluff .  a few erotic moments occur in the film ; they take place in a van with little lighting and are filmed out of focus ( see , they're supposed to be valerie's fantasies -- how creative ) .  on a personal note , i was disturbed by the ludicrous english literature class shown in this film which valerie had to suffer through .  it's no wonder why she hated high school so much .  as an instructor of english myself , i have a hard time accepting the fact that in a course emphasizing great literature , a teacher would stoop to reading a student's bad poetry ( of course , it's valerie's ) about boyfriends out loud and then embarassing its author in front of class with questions about the poem's inspiration .  i guess the public school system is still setting dubious standards for its students .  fatal charm won't charm anyone , unless there's someone that's charmed by boring , lifeless , insipid , suspenseless thrillers .  if you happen upon this turkey , just keep moving on .

0|a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel .  well , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller .  anyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man .  the original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it .  no more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable .  the story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist .  the captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60's ) .  to add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks .  some of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less .  none of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control .  this makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable .  all the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects .  the waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves .  it looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish .  also on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ?  if this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ?  regardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it .  as to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about .  the actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles .  having the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe .  watching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely .  the one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening .  so if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won't be too disappointed .  as the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens , it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect .  this movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv .  |-0.75|0.8666666666666667|0.9|The movie is heavily criticized for being predictable, having shallow characters, flaws in the story, and unimpressive special effects, but the actors' performances are mentioned as a redeeming factor.

0|"studio 54 attracted so many weird and bizarre people to its gates that it's a wonder why the film about the life and death of the studio centers itself on one very boring , cliched individual , not to mention an ensemble of people who wouldn't be at all fascinating unless they worked at the studio , which they did according to this film .  are we supposed to believe that out of all the strange folk who populated the studio nightly , that a character who is a bland ripoff of tony manero would really make a good protagonist for the film about it ?   "" 54 "" belongs in the elite group of films known as "" the big disappointments "" : the films that attain so much hype and/or so much potential in its creation that they come off worse than they are when they are finally finished .  i was heavily awaiting "" 54 , "" not the least because i've become fascinated with the infamous club , which has been the subject of an engrossing documentary that's been running all summer on vh1 , which is , weirdly enough , much more intriguing and engrossing than this "" edgy "" film .  perhaps more importantly , "" 54 "" is part of the blossoming subgenre , "" the 70s nostalgia film , "" which has been picking up mighty steam , what with "" boogie nights "" and "" the last days of disco "" coming out within the year , and both being such damn good movies that not only captured the feel of a certain time period ( the late 70s party and the early 80s wakeup period ) , but brought us interesting and real characters , like scotty , the tragically gay boom mike operator from "" boogie nights , "" and charlotte , the ironically clueless and bitchy co-protagonist from "" the last days of disco , "" not to mention several others .   "" 54 "" deals not so much with the timeline of the studio ( how it began , how it was run , how it ended ) - that's all dealt with in the narrated opening and finale - but more interested in the characters who populated it .  this is a definite plus .  here's a film that could have been a fascinating 2 hour plus film about the tragic people who went there to party , and had to wakeup in the 80s when things like diseases , economy problems , and perhaps worst of all , reagan , all hit and forced everyone into a rude awakening .  the story of the studio is tragedy in itself : let's look at how it all affected the people .  but this film doesn't let that happen .  it gives us a half-assed protagonist named shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe , from "" i know what you did last summer "" ) , who's chief character trait is the fact that he's from new jersey , which also happens to be his chief character flaw ( i guess ) .  he's dim-witted , into being part of "" the scene , "" and soon finds he's become a bit of a rave amongst the studio regulars . . . a  bit like "" saturday night fever , "" 'cept no travolta and no real interest put into him .  poor , poor phillippe struggles to make him interesting , but all he is a half-assed character and not at all our ticket to the glimpse of the decadence going on inside the club that he could have been .  shane begins to hang out with some other denizens of the club , like anita ( salma hayek ) , a wannabe donna sommers , and her young hubby , greg randanzo ( breckin meyer , from "" clueless "" ) , who helps shane become a bartender and rise to a bit of fame .  although he begins to get somewhere when he sleeps with the foxy billie auster ( sela ward ) , an exec of sorts , he falls in lust with a soap star named julie black ( neve campbell ) , and thus the boring romance subplot that's all too not necessarily important to anything else in the film and never really becomes interesting at any point in the film .  the film's sole point of interest and one major strongpoint is the all-too necesary personage of steve rubell , played by mike myers ( you heard me ) .  rubell , the famous head of the studio acted as if he never stopped partying ever , and is an easy metaphor for the life and times of his creation , but the film , thanks to a surprisingly strong performance by myers , makes him out to be more than that .  notice the scenes sole shocking scene , where he tries to get felatio from one of his male employees in turn for a promotion : myers brings the humanity to rubell in this scene , and a couple others , that some of us who've only seen him on tv never saw , and proves to be perhaps the one aspect of studio 54 that this film actually nails .  first time feature director mark christopher proves that he's a better director than a writer , though not too terribly much .  his story is trite and shallow , as are his characters , and his direction is shockingly flat , especially for a film about this subject .  it's as if he had a great story to tell , but instead opted for the easier route .  the studio's recreation is amazingly accurate , though , and very impressive , but his direction is never captivating enough .  some people say that a film does its job if it makes you want to visit the locale it takes place in ( despite the film's tone , i still want to go to rome and its many nightclubs after i saw fellini's "" la dolce vita "" ) , and when i watched "" 54 , "" i didn't particularly want to stay .

( you waited 10 years , what's another few days ? - or why not set up another heist instead ? ) .  i'll tell you why , it's because we wouldn't have a ( bad ) movie otherwise , that's why !  and many , many more .  ugh , whatever the case , it was just about the time that douglas' character suddenly removed murphy's character from the mental home ( and how come she went with him so nicely ?  i thought she didn't trust him ) , that i turned to my buddy and asked when the movie had turned into a joke .  and a few bogus chase and action sequences later , we were left with a long-winded ending that did little to answer any other questions i might've still had , and actually brought up even more contradictions .  badly put together , this movie features some decent acting , some nice cinematography and an initially interesting premise , but loses it all in a haze of plot miscues which ultimately leave you with little care for anyone .  in fact , if it wasn't for brittany murphy's excellent portrayal of a traumatized teen , jennifer esposito's embarrassing performance as a police woman ( yeah , right !  watching her delivering lines was the funniest part of this flick- but it wasn't supposed to be ) and michael douglas' cool "" regular guy "" part , there would be little reason to remain seated until the end of this picture .  incidentally , can anyone please give me one good reason why esposito's character was in this movie in the first place ?  she was completely superfluous .  and on top of all that , by the end of this flick , the director seems to have realized how dumb the audience must be to have bought most of the garbage that he'd been shoveling out for the hour and a half prior , and decides to add insult to injury by flashing back to an earlier character's death when one of the bad guys dies , just so we know ( as an audience ) , that the two are interrelated somehow .  ooooh , thanks , mr . fleder . . . i  appreciate the spoon-feeding , dude . . . yum ,  yum . . . but  how about explaining every other plot point in your film that made no sense ?  whatever .  either way , i don't give a rat's ass because this movie is a dog and that's unfortunate because it actually did have some good points going for it .  see it if you like dumb thrillers .  incidentally , if you appreciated along came a spider , you will likely enjoy this film as well .  they both start off with interesting premises , only to toss all logic and sense out the window about halfway through .  where's joblo coming from ?  along came a spider ( 4/10 ) - girl , interrupted ( 5/10 ) - kiss the girls ( 7/10 ) - primal fear ( 7/10 ) -- seven ( 10/10 )  "|-0.6833333333333332|0.8666666666666667|0.7666666666666666|The overall sentiment of the explanations is that the user has a negative opinion of the movie due to criticism of plot holes, inconsistencies, lack of logic, unsatisfying ending, spoon-feeding of information, and flaws in acting and plot.
0|"i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world .  and i wish that film-makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how _not_ to do it .  writer/director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul-searching in this tale of seth warner ( aidan quinn ) , a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country-western lyrics : his pregnant wife drowns , his home is destroyed by a tornado , he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning .  convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant , seth decides to break his , and sets out to turn every "" thou shalt not "" of the ten commandments into a "" thou shalt "" ( and vice versa ) .  his wife's sister rachel ( "" friends "" ' courteney cox ) wants to help seth ; rachel's selfish husband harry ( anthony lapaglia ) , who tends to break a few commandments of his own , thinks seth is a lunatic .  thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion .  taplitz isn't interested in treating seth's tragedies as genuinely tragic , making it impossible to sympathize with him .  composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds , turning seth's sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark ; quinn's performance as seth is all wild-eyed fervor without any genuine pain .  the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought , with one through five dispatched in a five-minute montage .  the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high-concept movie plot .  it's not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth .  corporate attorney rachel is given a case which is supposed to soften a hard heart we see no indication she has , while harry gets his comeuppance as part of seth's "" false witness . ""  only courteney cox strikes a note of reality in a solid performance ; she is sane center around which too equally troubled men revolve .  even she can't force taplitz to decide whose story this is , or what we should have learned about dealing with the struggles in our lives and our relationship with the infinite .  by the time seth makes a singularly biblical reappearance late in the film , it has become clear that taplitz is aiming for a fantastical fable which makes no connection with real human experience .  commandments is a bad comedy which could have been a decent drama if daniel taplitz had had the guts to take faith -- and the loss thereof -- at all seriously .
