1|"at first glance , daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie .  on second glance it looks that way too .  although , as typical disaster movies go , daylight isn't that bad .  admittedly , it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by ( think poseidon adventure ) .  but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the "" haven't i seen this scene somewhere before ? ""  feeling that creeps up all too often during the film .  sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york's emergency response team .  by sheer luck , he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film .   "" what disaster is that ? ""  you ask , as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat .  glad you asked .  through a whole sequence of entirely probable events ( about as probable as hitting the lottery ) a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city .  the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends , which causes not only massive loss of life , but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel .  good old sly , who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses , offers his services to the rescuers , who gladly accept it .  sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft ( think judge dredd ) which he can only go in , and not out off , and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside .  so begins the fun , but the fun has to be quick , because this tunnel has started to spring a leak .  the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie .  not superb by any means , but far above some of his other films ( think judge dredd again ) .  daylight's acting is probably average , or a little above , in terms of this sort of genre , starring this particular star .  amy brenneman is the only actor of any note , and she does a pretty good job as stallone's reluctant helper .  oh yeah , stallone's real life son , sage , is in this too .  sage -- nice name .  i guess it could be worse , he could have been named nutmeg or parsley .  note to sage -- you are still young .  go to school and get a good education -- you don't have a future in acting .  the plot runs along the same lines as the acting -- interesting , but predictable .  mostly due to the fact that it was pretty well recycled from a dozen other action flicks .  the biggest problem with a film of this nature is that they try to cram too many things into the movie .  as soon as the cast clears one seemingly impossible hurdle , another one seems to pop right up , even worse than the last one .  i realize that it wouldn't be much of a movie otherwise , but it does make the movie a bit predictable .  adding to the predictability is the cast of characters , which of course , has to include at least one or two difficult people who want to do things their own way and think the qualified guy ( in this case stallone ) doesn't know what he is doing .  why is it in disaster movies we can never have everyone agree with each other and all work together ?  would this be too much to ask ?  can't we all just get along ?  special effects weren't bad -- but i've certainly seen better .  some of the scenes , while fun to watch , were such blatant rip-offs that you had to wonder if scripts from old movies were just copied verbatim .  especially all of the scenes that involved anything underwater ( the tunnel , of course , starts to flood ) .  i really expected gene hackman , roddy mcdowell and ernest borgnine to appear at any minute -- i wasn't sure if i was watching daylight or the poseidon adventure .  i suppose if you have to rip off a movie for good ideas , the poseidon adventure is a good one to use .  the underwater sequences ( aside from the deja vu ) were very well shot and worked fairly well .  they were the best part of the movie by a long shot .  better than average stallone flick .  i realize that's not saying much when the man has judge dredd on his resume .  but certainly not up to the standards of cliffhanger .  daylight is a fun movie , and as long as you aren't expecting a whole lot you might even be pleasantly surprised .

1|"after the simple looking little spacecraft lands in a automobile wrecking yard , out steps a steel-gray , human-like creature with aquamarine eyes and clad in a muscular suit .  spencer , the boy who observes this , having seen his fill of science fiction flicks , figures this thing must be a robot from outer space .  with the exception of disney and a few others , most studios view children's films as a way to ship a cheap and unimaginative product and thereby make a quick profit .  star kid stands out as that rare kids' film that is undoubtedly low-budget but is also highly imaginative .  remember , the robot ?  it wasn't one at all but rather a "" phase one assault cyborsuit . ""  the cyborsuit is actually a prototype combat enhancer developed by the trelkins and jettisoned for latter retrieval when they are under attack from the invading broodwarriors .  the significant twist in the story is that spencer gets to go inside the cyborsuit , and the cyborsuit , nicknamed cy , has plenty of spunk .  cy keeps questioning the kid about everything including words like "" cool . ""  upon hearing that "" command , "" cy starts rapidly decreasing the temperature in the cyborsuit until spencer screams for him to stop .  and when cy speaks , we see spencer's view , the backside of cy's lips and eyes .  as 12-year-old spencer , joseph mazzello from the jurassic park film series gives a remarkably good performance as a wimpy and initially tongue-tied kid .  even when enclosed in his powerful new cyborsuit , he has his fears but he learns to overcome them .   "" if you run away , things don't get better , whether it's bullies , spiders , or girls , "" his science teacher advises him after he has difficulties dealing with all three .  turbo ( joey simmrin ) , the school's chubby bully , beats up on him , spiders frighten him , and , most embarrassing of all , he can't speak when in the presence of his would-be girlfriend .  with his cyborsuit on , he learns some bravery that transcends his time inside cy .  spencer lives with his dad and his older teenage sister stacey , played by a smart-mouthed ashlee levitch , who looks like a younger sarah jessica parker .  stacey derides her brother , whom she barely tolerates , by referring to him only as "" the fungus . ""  this whole setup for spencer's downtrodden and delightfully funny life makes his acquisition of some superhuman powers a source of mirth and empowerment .  the beauty of mazzello's performance is that you can vicariously experience his fear and share in his enjoyment when he goes after the bully to teach him a lesson he'll not soon forget .  the ensuing mayhem has some of the home alone antics , but the slapstick is kept tightly under control by writer and director manny coto so that one never feels embarrassed to be laughing .  the romantic angle is handled ever so delicately .  when cy wishes to know if spencer wants to mate with the object of his desire , michelle ( lauren eckstrom ) , his eyes open wide in revulsion .   "" mate with her ! ""  spencer exclaims .   "" pllllleeeeease , i just like her that's all . ""  the show has many funny twists .  in one , cy sees a man in a barney-like costume and begins firing at him , thinking he is an alien life-form .  soon things get way out of hand , and cy and spencer have to beat a hasty retreat .  as proof positive of the show's class , it actually contains tasteful bathroom humor -- thought that was an oxymoron in a kids' picture , didn't you ?  cy cannot allow spencer to leave the cyborsuit , and what happens when he needs to urinate becomes both sweet and hilarious .  the director's staging of this sequence is one of the film's more charming moments .  oh , and eating is pretty funny too .  spencer , whose idol is the comic book character "" midknight warrior , "" gets to face the challenge of a lifetime when a broodwarrior comes to capture the cyborsuit .  spencer's valiant battle gives him a chance to find his mettle .  and the action sequences in the battle manage to be quite respectable for a kids' show full of inventiveness and lacking the usual repetition .  for a family movie mixing humor , fantasy , and action , star kid delivers .  although it's probably not the sort of movie you'd want to see without kids , with them you'll have a magical time with a relatively straightforward but well developed story .  you'll be rooting for and laughing with spencer and his buddy cy all the way through .  star kid runs 1 : 41 .  it is rated pg for fantasy combat .  although the basically cartoonish broodwarrior might scare the littlest kids , i saw none of this in evidence in our packed screening , so i would say the show is fine for kids five and up , and possibly the younger ones .  my son jeffrey , age 8 , got really excited about the picture .  he called it "" an especially good movie "" and gave it * * * * .  when i asked him to tell me his favorite characters , he mentioned almost everyone in it from the boy to the cyborsuit to the bully .

1|"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  like its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent .  a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking .  the film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop .  as boogie nights opens , he's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity .  recruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar .  wholeheartedly embraced by jack's troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his "" one special thing "" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a "" big bright shining star "" .  his lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in .  the element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious .  from the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson's accomplished command of the camera is without question .  while novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco's unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent .  it's a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker's career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it's somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he's clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he's borrowing from some of the best , and it's entirely effective within the context of this film .  while boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it's also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour .  the film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded .  while much of the film's humour pertains to the characters' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope's demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get 'freaky deaky' with the music -- it's elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous .  a giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk's bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking .  ably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson's personal collection ) , there's a clear affection for the era in boogie nights .  it's the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film's promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters .  after the debacle with 1996's milos forman film , the people vs .  larry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public .  however , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it's hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there's very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business .  the glimpses on the sets of jack horner's shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there's a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it's refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided .  if anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves .  jack horner's dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) .  in both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack's retort of "" there are shadows in light , baby "" to his cinematographer's complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood's "" it's not about the little details , it's about the big picture ! ""  rant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false .  in boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there's nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an 'artistic' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark .  much like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes "" this is the best work i've ever done "" , it's genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness .  mr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter .  while boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn't any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film's characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film's * protagonist * literally doesn't say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it's no wonder why the playfully inane "" how much can you bench ? ""  banter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film's finest exchanges .  and while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it's problematic that some of the the threads given to the film's characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore's child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character's story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions .  still , even if he doesn't always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same .  in any case , it's hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it's a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger's "" sister christian "" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard .  if this scene already wasn't tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness .  there are some other interesting touches in boogie nights .  mr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect .  similarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver's seat , sobbing "" i'm so stupid "" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver's seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening .  boogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good .  while most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention .  mr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard's georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film .  i'm not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee .  mr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it's wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation .  worth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track "" you got the touch "" in a vain attempt at a musical career .  mr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective .  ms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry .  consequently , it's a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she's lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp .  her role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she's essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity .   ( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! )  and a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham's parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant's drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet .  draw your own conclusions .  perhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion .  his relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it's no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry .  while the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle's eyes makes the scene unforgettable .  luis guzman's most famous work is possibly in brian de palma's carlito's way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who's a hanger-on to jack's group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures .  jack's eventual acquiescence to maurice's request leads to one of boogie nights' biggest comic payoffs .  boogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work .  striking a fine balance between humour and drama , and exceptionally well-crafted , there's no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year .

1|"bruce willis and sixth sense director m . night shyamalan re-team to tell the story of david dunne ( willis ) , a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child .  on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of .  to make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed .  a comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l . jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life .  price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him . . .  someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break .  price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child .  dunne doesn't believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his "" powers "" and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is .  writer/director m . night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense .  how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ?  for shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners .  does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ?  the answer to that question is not a very easy one , either .  as far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable .  it wasn't until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached .  for unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before .  the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan's direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving .  there are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis' character and another train passenger .  the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak .  also very impressive is the film's score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan's sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year's dinosaur ) .  several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film .  one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to "" exercise "" his powers .  the music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie .  if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it .  the film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment .  willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can't seem to figure out why he's been depressed for the last few years .  his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah's tutelage .  jackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah .  though his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked .  robin wright penn's role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character's need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again .  spencer treat clark , as the dunne's young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film .  out of all the characters , jeremy's is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role .  where the film does lose points though , is during its "" surprise "" ending .  shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying "" that was it ? ! ""  when unbreakable revealed its own ending .  it's not that the ending is bad , it's just that the ending doesn't quite have the emotional punch that the other film's did .  plus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won't reveal the ending here , but you'll understand what i mean when you see it ) .  essentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable .  the only real problem is that the ending doesn't quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor .  as long as it isn't held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film .  one thing seems clear , though .  shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film .

1|"there's good news and bad news about mulan .  the positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules .  on the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast .  but mulan is a step in the right direction and disney's best animated feature since the lion king .  after giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians .  mulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married .  that's what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her .  cartoons . . .  meanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns .  since mulan's a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go .  she pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family .  that's chinese culture for you . . .  so imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father's uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place .  the movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army .  it should have been called g . i .  chang .  mulan calls on her ancestors for help .  they decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up .  voiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges .  murphy's performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they're going to have .  you ain't never had a friend like mushu .  speaking of songs , mulan doesn't have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this .  disney songs about war probably wouldn't go over too well ( "" heigh ho , heigh ho , it's off to war i go . . . "" ) , and the ones they do have aren't memorable .  the best of the bunch , sad to say , is "" be a man , "" the requisite basic training montage song .  yes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle .  sung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , "" be a man "" accompanies footage of mulan's platoon going from screw-ups to heroes .  it makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that's ended badly ?  i only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage .  for the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl .  all she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china .  the deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best .  but she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster .  as a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable .  i saw the movie yesterday and i don't remember the man's name .  otherwise , mulan is a good movie .  the animation of the characters themselves isn't as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots .  eddie murphy pulls off some good one-liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star .  hell , george "" mr . sulu "" takei does a voice in mulan .  you get the sense disney said to themselves , "" alright , let's get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood .  who can you think of ?

1|"harmless , silly and fun comedy about dim-witted wrestling fans gordie and sean ( david arquette and scott caan ) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king ( oliver platt ) .  when king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter ( joe pantoliano ) , gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory .  my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on , as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed ( but not fake , mind you ) .  the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that .  arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances , which is exactly what a movie like this requires , and oliver platt ( one of my favorite actors ) is a riot as the drunken washed-up ex-champion .  many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record , but for me it just added to the "" silly factor "" of the film , thereby increasing my enjoyment of it .  one casting complaint however : rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer ?  please . . .  if rose mcgowan is sexy then i'm marilyn manson .  given the current state of the actual wcw , if oliver platt were appearing as jimmy king right now on wcw programming , he'd be the most popular guy they have .  on a similar note , the "" plot line "" of the wresting portions of the film are more entertaining than anything the wcw writers have been able to come up with in the last two years .  although one does have to ask . . .  why would any wrestling promoter fire the head wrestler of a company who is both unbeaten and extremely popular with the fans ?  director brian robbins ( you'll remember him as eric from tv's "" head of the class "" ) just knows how to make good dumb movies .  this movie fits in nicely with his previous efforts good burger and varsity blues .  and screenwriter steven brill ( the epic mighty ducks trilogy , late last night ) manages to keep things both sophomoric and clever at the same time , with almost all the jokes of the film getting a laugh out of me .  the only exceptions to that were : 1 ) a scene involving a van full of singing nuns and 2 ) any scene involving the old woman wrestling fan .  those moments made me cringe and/or groan .  as an added bonus though , the audience is treated to outtakes from the film as the final credits roll .

1|"steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities , because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits , like jurassic park , and "" oscar "" -awarded critical triumphs like schindler's list .  however , in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories .  one of them is close encounters of the third kind , extremely popular and influential science-fiction spectacle .  unfortunately , it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars .  although both films have a lot in common ( ground-breaking special effects , brilliant score by john williams ) their future was different ; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon , and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow .  when spielberg began work on that project , he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit , jaws .  together with other young directors of his "" new hollywood "" generation , like kauffman , carpenter , hill and millius , he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s , when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment .  ironically , it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of "" blockubuster "" philosophy .  but in the mid 1970s , many things were different ; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie .  although very personal , spielberg's screenplay was partly based on the book "" ufo experience "" by dr . j . allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2 .  spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology , but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost , unmatched until the contemporary era of x-files and the roswell anniversary .  that was partly because he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo-related incidents as the element of the plot .  the story begins with one of such incidents - team of international scientists come to the sonorra desert in mexico to find the u . s . navy planes of who went missing decades ago during the famous flight 19 .  such events coincide with the ufo incident witnessed by roy neary ( richard dreyfuss ) , power company worker from muncie , indiana , who later becomes obsessed with his experience .  because of his obsession he loses his job , family and sanity , but his loss is nothing compared to the experience of jillian guiler ( melinda dillon ) , single mother whose son becomes the victim of alien abduction .  in the meantime , the scientists decipher the strange signals from outer space and u . s . government , in co-operation with the french , led by lacombe ( francois truffaut ) begin with the preparation for ultra-secret project .  when the news of the poison gas leak in the middle of wyoming reach neary , he finally sees some sense in all his visions and begins the perilous journey toward the centre of endangered area .  there he is joined by jillian who shared the similar visions .  two of them must break through military pickets and reach their destination to find whatever is there .  spielberg here shows great mastery by using the very same techniques of jaws to make completely different effects .  the slow , gradual yet very disciplined series of dramatic incidents - "" close encounters "" - is set in order to bring the viewer to the great revelation in the finale .  but , instead of the fear and horror we had to endure during the jaws , we are now overwhelmed by the sense of boyish wonder .  throughout the movie the viewer knows that something big , magnificent and wonderful is about to happen , and great magician spielberg delivers his promise in the end .  the last sequence , with its , even in this age , impressive special effects by the great virtuoso douglas trumbull , would leave many mouths open .  one of the great virtues of this film is its optimism .  aliens , who almost always get portrayed as the monsters in science-fiction cinema , are here benevolent and harmless creatures and the first contact between them and humanity is a beginning of something wonderful .  it is very ironic , when we consider that the two classic sf movies that visually inspired spielberg actually told quite different story - howard hawks' thing and byron haskin's war of the worlds presented extraterrestrials as the threat to the mankind .  spielberg's humane approach and faith in the future also lies in great contrast to the pessimistic mood of its era ; the only hint of the contemporary gloom is post-watergate portrayal of government as conspiratorial towards the public .  but , even such government is much more harmless compared to the murderous and chain-smoking men in black that became the stereotype thanks to x-files and its more cynical and disturbing visions .  there lies the main , and probably the only flaw of this great picture - lack of conflict , and consequently , lack of drama .  the movie has few excitements or even action scenes ( especially the last that may be an interesting homage to hitchcock's north by northwest ) but generally , almost everyone - neary , jillian , government , aliens - are the good guys .  despite such shortcomings , the actors were good and manage to bring multidimensionality to their simple roles .  richard dreyfuss is very convincing as a ordinary , yet nice guy , who sinks into insanity only to rediscover himself in a grand finale .  melinda dillon was , on the other hand , nominated for "" oscar "" as a struggling mother , yet she was overshadowed by teri garr as neary's long-suffering wife ronnie .  apart from visual wonders of this film , spielberg's semi-official composer john williams again excels by his beautiful music , this time using the simple melody both as the element of a plot , and as the basis for his score .  the aliens , who are the main subject of this film , were visually very convincing .  too convincing , one of my acquaintances in the ufo-researching circles said .  according to him , the depiction of extraterrestrials as grey-skinned little people with big eyes was so accurate , that it managed to freak out powerful government figures interested in suppressing the truth about ufos .  so , they later approached spielberg and ordered him to make another movie with alien , this time designed to be anything but the real life .  the result was e . t . , for many years the biggest commercial hit of all times , yet less inspirational for ufo enthusiasts .  anyway , whether the viewer believes in existence of extraterrestrials or ufos , close encounters of the third kind remains the great movie , and one of the rare uplifting experiences in modern cinema .

1|"with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink , the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories : quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the "" film noir "" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control ( fargo , miller's crossing , blood simple ) , and off-the-wall comedies centered around an eccentric , scatter-brained lead character ( raising arizona , the hudsucker proxy ) .  their latest offering , the big lebowski , falls within the latter category , though there are elements of the crime-gone-wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film .  the main difference , however , is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but didn't quite have the brains to get it all together , the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who's wise to the world , but he doesn't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling , smoke pot , and generally relax .  that main character is jeffrey "" the dude "" lebowski ( jeff bridges ) , introduced by the film's rambling narrator ( sam elliott ) as "" quite possibly the laziest man in los angeles county . ""  the dude is unemployed , needless to say , and spends most of his time at the bowling alley with his two best friends , walter ( john goodman ) , a borderline-psychotic who's in the habit of pulling a gun when he thinks somebody's cheating in a bowling match ( "" has the whole world gone crazy ? ! "" he shouts at a suspected cheater ) , and donny ( steve buscemi ) , who's always a few steps behind the conversation and is constantly berated by walter for it ( "" donny , you have no frame of reference here ! "" ) .  these three seem to more or less live for bowling tournaments , and as the film begins they are anticipating an important match with rival bowler jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , who , when we first meet him , is doing a dance in the bowling lane to accompany a spanish version of "" hotel california "" and , if it's possible , seems to be even more of a head case than walter .  if that doesn't give you a good idea of this film's absurdist tone , then perhaps this will : the entire scenario which drives the story is set in motion by two thugs mistakenly urinating on the dude's rug .  they've mistaken him for a millionaire of the same name who is also known as the "" big "" lebowski ( david huddleston ) and whose nymphomaniac wife bunny ( tara reid ) owes money to porn producer jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) .  the dude goes to the big lebowski seeking compensation for his ruined rug ; he doesn't have any luck , but when bunny is apparently kidnapped , the elder lebowski asks him to deliver the $1 million ransom .  unfortunately , walter gets involved and fouls up the drop-off , and before they can try again to get the money to the supposed kidnappers , the dude's car gets stolen , along with the briefcase containing the money .  soon , the dude is being harassed not only by the big lebowski himself but also by treehorn and by a group of german "" nihilists "" who demand the ransom money even though they may not have been involved in the kidnapping in the first place ; the dude and walter suspect that bunny may well have kidnapped herself in order to extort money from her husband to repay her debts to treehorn .  meanwhile , the big lebowski's daughter maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist avant-garde artist who likes to make grand entrances swinging through the air naked , wants to recover the money for her family .  the plot , however , is really just a vehicle for all these bizarre characters to run wild and wreak their own unique forms of havoc .  the previews for the big lebowski feature creedence clearwater revival's "" run through the jungle , "" and it fits : the coens see los angeles as a veritable jungle of oddballs and nutcases , with the sometimes bewildered dude left to run through it and try to avoid any more trouble ( usually unsuccessfully ) .  the film doesn't feature quite as many one-liners and sight gags as the coens' other comedies ( though there are a few hilarious moments of visual humor , particularly in the dude's dream sequences and acid flashbacks ) , but it more than makes up for it with the sheer fun of watching these strange characters interact .  the film sometimes seems a little disjointed as a result - you get the feeling that the coens have not only set their characters loose in this "" jungle "" but are also themselves running crazy through the jungle of their own twisted imaginations - but for the most part the characterizations are interesting enough to overcome the shaky plotting and what turns out to be a somewhat anticlimactic resolution .  there's also a noticeable ( but not too heavy-handed ) thread of social commentary in the big lebowski , which , incidentally , takes place just as the gulf war is about to begin ; at the beginning , we see george bush on television making his "" this aggression will not stand "" speech .  the coens take aim at just about every elite l . a . subculture in the book : the egotistical wealthy businessman ( "" the bums will always lose ! ""  shouts the big lebowski at one point ) , the porn industry , the overbearing malibu policeman who berates the dude for disturbing their "" peaceful beach community , "" and so on .  by the end , we really start to admire the dude , who almost certainly harbors the least "" aggression "" of anyone in this story ; his passive resistance ( emphasis on "" passive , "" albeit ) to the elite emerges as something more than just another quirky characterization in a film overflowing with quirky characters .  he also turns out to have a pretty well-functioning brain in his head , even if he doesn't like to use it very much ; his sarcasm towards treehorn and the malibu policeman shows that he knows when he's getting a run around , and he does manage to unravel the kidnapping mystery by the end .  the coens certainly poke fun at the dude for his laziness , but they don't just treat him as fodder for cheap shots either .  i think that , more than anything , is what makes the big lebowski a standout comedy : it manages to approach characters like the dude and , to some extent , walter , with genuine affection while still acknowledging that they are pretty scatter-brained .  audience members may find themselves surprised at how much they like the un-dynamic duo by the end of the movie , given that they seemed like nothing more than the butts of an extended joke at first .   "" it's good knowin' he's out there , the dude , takin' it easy , "" posits the narrator towards the end .  i dare say that truer words have seldom been spoken .

1|" "" the endurance : shackleton's legendary antarctic expedition ""  in 1914 , as the great war descended upon europe , sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica , this time to be the first to cross the ice-bound continent on foot .  28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years .  director george butler , using film footage and photographs from the historic journey , tells their remarkable story in "" the endurance : shackleton's legendary antarctic expedition . ""  the expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse , on foot , the vast wasteland of antarctica .  as the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea , the entry to the cold , cruel continent , they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land .  for months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed , stranding the men on the flow , propelling them away from their goal and , eventually , into their lifeboats for safety .  shackleton , faced with a desolate situation , made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island .  once on this "" safe "" haven , shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization .  he and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world's roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia .  miraculously , the six land , after 17 days at sea , on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous , snow covered mountains , covering 22 miles in just 36 hours .  this ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen .  in the end , he is successful and everyone made it back home alive , only to be swallowed up by the ravages of the war .  the title of this fascinating documentary , "" the endurance , "" is more than just the name of ship that carried the crew of brave men to the edge of the world .  it is also the description of the stamina and ability of every one of the men who survived 19-months of the toughest , most grueling conditions on the face of the earth .  the name of the film is a tribute to every member of the crew and to the ship that sheltered them for many month of frigid antarctic weather .  it also describes the focused mental state of shackleton who never gave up on himself or his men .  with astonishing foresight , shackleton brought australian cinematographer and photographer frank hurley along on the journey .  the filmed footage and photos are remarkable as they capture the ordeal of the men , day to day life , the affection all felt for their loyal sled dogs , the slow destruction of the endurance and the preparations to get off of the pack ice flow .  after the sinking of the ship , the remaining film stock , with the exception of a still camera and three rolls of film , had to be discarded so the continuing chronicle of the incredible journey gets less photo documentation as the ordeal plods on .  considering hurley was using relatively primitive photo technology in one of the world's harshest environments and captured so much on film is a feat unto itself .   ( hurley created his own account of the shackleton expedition in his 1919 documentary , "" south , "" an interesting companion piece for "" the endurance . ""  if shackleton's original idea , document his trek across the frigid southern continent , had been successful , it would have been considered a super human feat .  as you watch the story of "" the endurance "" unfold , you realize that the disastrous obstacles the sir ernest and his men faced and overcame were even greater accomplishments than the first intent .   ( shackleton's amazing 800-mile journey in an open boat is fodder for a rousing adventure story all by itself . )  there are a couple of minor nitpicks with this fine work , though .  actor liam neeson narrates the story , but his voice is too soft spoken and lilting for the dramatic tale .  the nature of the ordeal also concentrates most of the visual material , both film and photo , in the documentary's first half .  as the crew's adventure takes more drastic paths , hurley had less and less film stock available to chronicle the awesome events .  helmer butler and his team fill in the blanks , but the treasure of "" the endurance , "" its film footage , is mostly relegated to the early months of the expedition .  i can't think of a true-life adventure that shows , better , the triumph of man over seemingly insurmountable odds .   "" the endurance , "" based on caroline alexander's book , is an eye-opening documentary that goes where few men have gone before and , even more remarkably , all 28 survivors lived to tell about it .  i give it a b+ .

""  into my bewildered visage .  it's almost always a surprise .  it sure as niflheim was this time .  amazing grace and chuck is being advertised as a modern fairy tale , of a boy in montana who quits his little league team for a very unusual reason .  and , in the hands of anyone less careful than the creative staff of this film , it might very well be nothing more than a fairy tale , where we roll our eyes occasionally , smirk to ourselves , and maybe get a forced tear out of the eyes and a "" boy , i wish that could happen "" sigh out of the lips upon exiting the theater and tossing the empty pepsi cup into the trash .  another e . t .  another short circuit .  this film floored me , for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept , the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough , and presents itself well enough , to make it more of an american folk tale , with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time .  america has always had its mythical heros , its paul bunyans and john waynes ; this film presents us with more general , but still universal , ideals : the honest , innocent children who have their own inner wisdom ; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage , honor , and love for their respective sport ; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding , but has the grit to get things done when they need doin' ( does the latter sound familiar ? ) .  amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters , but it never leaves you with the feeling that it's artificial , that it stands behind glass , or that any sharp breeze--or , more importantly , sharp thought--will shatter the wax facade of the panorama .  this is a very sturdy scenario .  the principals are always given dialogue , and always give performances--always ( it just blows me away ) -- which made them seem real , yet enforces their particular mythic role .  the writer/producer , david field , seems to literally take all the "" yeah , but in real life , this would have happen "" thoughts you get in your head , sticks them in the movie and uses them to bend the plot around to his original heading , in a stronger way then before !  astounding !  he uses obstacles to the plot to * enforce * it !  i am truly impressed ( indeed , envious ) with the skill in which he wrote the story and screenplay ; it's so very unusual , especially in a hollywood film .  i don't want to give too much away , but the basic premise is that chuck ( joshua zuehlke ) , the little league pitcher , decides to give up baseball because of nuclear weapons .  his decision begins an unlikely series of events that involve another athlete , a boston basketball player ( alex english ) , "" amazing "" grace smith , and , well , i'm leaving it at that because i wouldn't spoil this film for you for the world .  let me just say this , though : i am not recommending this film because i think it has a great message or because of any political positions it might imply .  i don't give a rat's ass for the political point-of-view this film expresses , one way or another ; i'm recommending you go see this film because , and only because , it's an excellent story , told with excellence .  no , i don't believe what happens in this film could happen in real life ; while i tend to believe the arms control policy of this country is stilted , i believe in careful negotiations , mutual verification , etc . screw what i think .  the point is , this film is able to suspend my disbelief and tell a story that is one of the most finely crafted pieces of american dream i have ever seen on the movie screen .  this is the natural and more--all the mythic qualities without the pretentiousness or the forced feeling of the conclusion , and a much better script to boot .  it carried me into the beliefs and ideals of my boyhood--and , more importantly , without any bumps or jolts that would snap me out of the trance with some hint of self-consciousness .  special kudos to : both zuehlke ( a real-life little league pitcher who was picked for the part ) and english ( a forward for the denver nuggets ) for their seamless personification of their characters ; jamie lee curtis , who takes a surprisingly small role and makes it exceedingly memorable as amazing's manager and friend ; william l . peterson ( in a * big * change from his role in to live and die in l . a . ) as a father who shows principles without having to stand up and wave a flag doing it ; and gregory peck , as the guy we wish ronald reagan really was ( and who some numbskulls still probably think he is  "|0.791|0.8833333333333333|0.8833333333333333|"The overall sentiment towards the film ""Amazing Grace and Chuck"" is extremely positive, with the reviewer expressing admiration for its storytelling, characters, performances, and ability to suspend disbelief."

""  in short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories .  after all , apart from the obvious it's-a-holocaust-film and it's-a-spielberg-film , isn't "" schindler's list "" just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study .   "" a civil action "" is the same way : it's narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study .  and it's here that the film seems to go a bit wrong .  the main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it's an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that's not necessarily the problem with the film .  it's that it's just kind of unsatisfying .  if this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way .  but this film just seems to end , and i don't want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won't bitch about what is , essentially , genuine .  but the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it .  it's rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who's shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he's manipulative and he always wins .  it wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full .  we see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don't fully believe it .  and i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film's conclusion that of incompleteness .  in the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases .  in short , he's full of bullshit and we know it .  in the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river .  point one , it's not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren't nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success ) .  point two , it has been through several lawyers .  after turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out . . . is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h . macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town's company .  they spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in "" wilde , "" pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant .  they also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on ) .  as we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis ) .  things begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money .  as macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , "" fargo "" ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist .  in fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic . . . i  suppose like a grisham novel ) .  this wouldn't be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he's seen as being still full of bullshit .  because he doesn't take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out .  the final half tries to redeem this , as must have been the point of making this in zallian's mind , but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs , and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he's seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him ( and thusly receiving two speeding tickets ) , we still feel that the big change in his life is that he's not rich and esteemed anymore ( the film's final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow ) .  the fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it's still going on , you know ) , but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has .  we need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life , and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life .  it only feels like half of that .  maybe even less .  and it's not travolta , who does a great job here ( though never to be a truly memorable performance of his ) , but rather zallian , whose final chapter needs a rewrite .  up to then , though , it's an engrossing drama , one of the best of the year in fact , and one of the best lawyer films , period .  the reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted , but rather it's about the lawyers , the knights who battle eachother .  we learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town , but the reason it can't be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find .  and duvall's facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it's almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is .  facher is seen as an elderly man , a goofy eccentric , carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it , eating lunches out of paper bags , and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio , and scold anyone who interupts him .  but look deeper and you see a master at work : his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him , and it's difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way .  that's why i liked this film : it's hard to put a pointer on .  you can never see exactly where this film will land , and even when the credits roll , you still aren't sure what to make of it .  call it the zallian effect .  same thing happened with "" schindler's list "" ( not that i'm comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman ) .  each film is so greatly crafted that you can't help but get involved in its broad storytelling , interesting characters , and , most peculiarly , the wit that comes along with it .  if only it felt totally complete ( like , say , "" schindler's list , "" though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two ) , it might have been one of the best films of the year , and along with that , a full breath of fresh air .

1|in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in .  we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves .  without an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye .  even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema .  but do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ?  exploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept .  is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ?  midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth .  as joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration .  during the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . '  as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead . '  a troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone .  having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody .  joe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream .  he romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance .  by the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing .  just as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success .  but how realistic are these ideals ?  joe had raped and been raped in texas .  the scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas .  alongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation .  the ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention .  schlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny .  we understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame .  he runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york .  in the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself .  standing up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh .  schlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation .  beyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison .  the fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation .  it is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men .  joe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff . '  there are two predominant images of new york .  the first is that new york is the rich , cosmopolitan city where hope and opportunity are symbolized by the tall skyscrapers and the statue of liberty .  the other new york is travis bickle's new york , a seedy , corruptive hell on earth .  joe envisions new york as the former , but is presented with the latter .  mirroring the irony in which joe envisions his cowboy attire as masculine , he mistakenly buys into the fable that new york is filled with lonely women neglected by gay men .  joe thinks he is performing a great service for new york , but the city rapes him of his pride and possessions .  the people steal joe's money , the landlord confiscates his luggage , and the homosexuals rob him of his dignity .  what has become of joe's american dream ?  schlesinger responds to this question with the scene at the party .  joe gets invited to a shindig of sorts and at the gathering is exposed to a dizzying array of food , drugs , and sex .  at the party , all of joe and ratzo's desires are made flesh ; joe flirts successfully with women and ratzo loads up on free salami .  contrasting joe's daily struggles , shots of warhol's crew display wanton indulgence .  there is an irreverence in the partygoers' attitude ; we see a shot of a woman kowtowing to nothing in particular , orgies breaking out in the periphery , and drugs passed around like party favors .  the party makes a mockery of joe' s ideals .  joe believed that hard work and persistence were the elements for success in america ; scenes of the party and his rendezvous with shirley suggest that it is the idle who profit from joe's toils .  the american dream , schlesinger suggests , is merely a proletarian fantasy , for those who are content no longer dream , but become indolent .  as joe heads to miami , all that was significant of the cowboy image has left him .  his masculinity is compromised and his morality is relinquished .  for joe , nothing is left of the cowboy hero and commensurately , he surrenders the identity .  tossing his boots into the garbage , he returns to the bus for the last leg of his journey to miami .  the final shot of midnight cowboy shows joe inside the bus , more introspective , taking only a few glances outside the window .  instead of the frequent pov shots of joe excitedly looking out of the bus on his way to new york , schlesinger sets up this final shot from the exterior of the bus looking in through the window at joe .  reflections of the palm trees ratzo so raved about run across the bus' window with joe hardly taking notice .  the scenery of miami no longer exacts the same excitement from joe as before .  the world seems smaller to joe now ; the termination of his journey coincides with the termination of his american dream .  no longer does joe aspire to be the enterprising gigolo ; he resolves to return to a normal job and resign to basic means .  midnight cowboy presents two familiar incarnations of the american dream .  there is the frontier fantasy that if you are brave enough to repel a few indians , you can set up a ranch out west and raise a beautiful family .  then there is the jay gatsby dream that a man of humble stock , with perseverance , can make a fortune in the big city .  joe's attempt to realize these dreams robs him of his innocence in texas and morality in new york .  during his search for an intangible paradise , joe ends up raping a girl and killing a man .  an allegory of chasing the promise of the american dream , joe buck's progressive moral atrophy is a warning against the pursuit of illusory icons .  |-0.2333333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|The text explores the disillusionment and loss of the American Dream experienced by Joe Buck, showcasing his failed attempts at finding success and redemption in both Texas and New York, ultimately leading to his moral decline. It critiques the ideals of success and salvation in America, suggesting that the pursuit of the American Dream is futile and warns against chasing illusory ideals, while also touching on themes of emasculation and the corruptive nature of New York City.

1|note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  floating life , australia's first-ever submission to the academy of motion picture arts & sciences for consideration in the best foreign language film category ( its dialogue is in cantonese , english , and german ) , marks a special accomplishment by clara law .  a compelling , at times poignant film , it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama .  floating life centers around a hong kong family's sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong , and is divided into clearly defined vignettes , each chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses , which serves to emphasize the film's theme of family .  the film opens with mr . and mrs . chan ( edwin pang , cecilia fong sing lee ) and their two teen sons ( toby wong , toby chan ) leaving the bustling , claustrophobic metropolis of hong kong to join their second daughter bing ( annie yip ) in australia .  with their spacious , immaculately-white new house and the vast abundance of neighbourhood greenery , the chans initially find this serene new land a strange and wonderous one , and - with neurotic bing cooly remarking about the possible dangers of australian life ( killer dogs , poisonous spiders , dangerous ultraviolet rays ) - a frightening one .  this sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants , aimlessly ambling about their new suburban neighbourhood , are sent scrambling by the yelps of a little white puppy .  the tone set up early in the film is broadly comic , and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society ( a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling ) , but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone .  floating life shifts its focus away from the exploits of the new immigrants and towards bing's domineering of her newly-reunited family , setting out a set of stringent and oppressive rules which create tremendous tension within the household and threaten to fracture the family .  meanwhile , elder daughter yen ( annette shun wah ) , happily settled in germany with her husband and young daughter , begins to suffer an identity crisis , manifesting itself with her claims to her patiently exasperated husband that their new home is cursed with bad feng shui , and further exacerbated upon hearing of the familial conflict down under .  among the dramatic threads of floating life , this is perhaps the most effective and engaging , with an interesting set of characters and a storyline which generates a genuine emotional punch .  the one misguided vignette in floating life involves eldest son gar ming ( anthony wong ) , left behind in hong kong to resolve various affairs on behalf of his family and to await his immigration papers before rejoining his parents and brothers in australia .  emotionally detatched and aimlessly drifting , his is an uncompelling character , and consequently subsequent attempts to draw out pathos are uninvolving and ineffective .  his desperate search for emotional fulfillment is depicted by philosopical droning on the exquisite peak of an orgasm , which quickly becomes tedious .  ms . law's film cheerfully embraces melodrama - each of the major vignettes feature excessively emotional climaxes which i couldn't help but find reminiscent to wayne wang's acutely unsubtle the joy luck club - but despite the director's rather clear attempts to tug at the heartstrings , i couldn't help but be touched by a powerful and affecting soliloquy delivered masterfully by cecilia fong sing lee which truly packs an emotional wallop and , in dramatic terms , is certainly the highlight of floating life .  floating life at times spreads itself too thin ; given the myriad of characters involved , it could either stand to delve into each vignette a little deeper , or narrow its focus to a select group of key characters .  however , it is a fine film , with a thoughtful and insightful screenplay by clara law and husband eddie ling-ching fong , and some superb acting by a cast consisting almost exclusively of non-actors ( special note is to be made of cecilia fong sing lee , annette shun wah , and a short but dazzling performance by an actress who portrayed gar ming's girlfriend from vancouver ) .  floating life is ultimately about the ties that bond a family together , which are able to withstand great distances and new environments .  |0.5|0.7666666666666666|0.9|The film is mostly positive, with mentions of compelling, poignant storytelling, superb acting, and powerful soliloquy. Some negative aspects include a misguided vignette and spreading itself too thin, but overall the sentiment is slightly positive.
1|"plot : a peculiar french girl grows up lonely with her father and doesn't quite know what she wants out of life .  one day , she falls upon something , and believes that her ticket to happiness may be in helping others .  she starts with the people around her , but when she suddenly falls for her own guy , she can't act strongly enough because of her shy and dreamy nature .  critique : a clever , quirky , original french flick set in a picturesque paris , featuring an endearing lead with a giant imagination , much loneliness and a little bit of love for everyone .  this is a "" feel-good "" kind of movie , a fairy tale for grown-ups who are bummed out about life .  it doesn't pretend to be deep , it doesn't weigh itself down with long expositions or intricate studies of its characters , it's basically just a "" cute movie "" in the same vein as chocolat and pay it forward , with some amazing visuals and incredibly nice intentions ( and if chocolat was somehow able to nab an oscar nomination for best picture last year ( a sham on so many different levels ) , you might as well slap this film up for consideration also , since it's quite a bit better and much more original than the former ) .  one thing that this film isn't though , at least according to me , is the best film of the year ( it was bestowed the honor of "" best "" in at least 3 different film festivals so far this year ) .  it actually managed to stagnate a little bit about halfway through and it just went on for way too long ( it's a little over two hours but it felt even longer ) , with much of the second half of the movie devoted to many different characters , all of whom weren't as interesting as the lead , and a lot of indecisiveness from ms . amelie herself , which got frustrating .  thankfully , this film doesn't bog itself down with too much of that stuff , and actually goes out of its way to invent new ways to shoot scenes , to integrate moments of fantasy into its fabric and to transport the audience inside the imagination of this kind-hearted french girl .  on the whole , it's a lot of fun and it carries a beautiful message of love and support for your fellow man .  the lead , audrey tautou , is perfect for the role , and gives you enough moments of truth to develop her character into someone that you care about by the end of the film .  unfortunately , the rest of the cast isn't as well-developed , and even though most of them are pretty appealing , a couple could've been left out to save time and at least one was left stranded plot-wise , by the film's end ( what happened to the guy in the caf ? who was spying on his ex-girlfriend the whole movie ? ) .  now i haven't seen too many recent french films , i will admit , but if this is the kind of "" scene "" that they're developing over in "" le pays du vin "" , i wouldn't mind catching more of their flicks in the future ( crimson rivers was another french film that i saw earlier this year , which i really liked- ironically , that film was directed by mathieu kassovitz , who is the co-star in this film ) .  granted , the english subtitles got a little tough to keep up with at times ( i speak and understand french also , but some of the local colloquialisms went over my head ) , especially since the film's visuals were so intriguing that you just couldn't help but constantly gawk at them , but the general idea , the background music , the nifty french neighborhoods , the very creative way of enveloping the audience into the story-line from the start , were all very easy to appreciate , and i for one was especially glad to have seen this movie during these trying times in the world .  in fact , i'd recommend it to anyone looking for a jolly ol' time at the movie house , with a particular emphasis on folks with a lot of imagination , a little loneliness in their lives and many dreams in their hearts .  and this guy directed alien : resurrection ?  get outta here ! !  note : i especially loved the way that the script detailed and showed the loves/hates of everyone with exact mentions in the film .  it was very original , very well shot and very nostalgic , as many of us were able to relate to the behaviors described .  good stuff !  where's joblo coming from ?  chocolat ( 6/10 ) - crimson rivers ( 8/10 ) - ghost world ( 9/10 ) - like water for chocolate ( 8/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - pay it forward ( 5/10 ) - rushmore ( 9/10 ) - woman on top ( 7/10 )  "|0.7166666666666667|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|The summarized explanation is: The sentiment of the text is mostly positive, with praise for the film's cleverness, quirkiness, originality, the endearing lead, and the beautiful message of love and support.

1|"eric rohmer's "" pauline at the beach , "" is one of those small , deliberately paced , but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise , but a lot happens to the characters emotionally .  the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast , and centers on six different characters , primarily pauline ( amanda langlet ) , a wise beyond her years 15-year-old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin , marion ( arielle dombasle ) .  on the first day at the beach , marion runs into an old high school flame ( fedoore atkine ) , and although he wants to rekindle their relationship , she is more interested in an older , more seductive womanizer ( pascal greggory ) , who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor ( rosette ) .  while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults , she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy ( simon de la brosse ) .   "" pauline at the beach , "" is not a film in which big dramatic things occur , and there is not a clear-cut , tidy conclusion to the story .  instead , it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life , and the surprises come from little character details . the film is quite talky and slow moving , and so it is pretty safe to say it isn't for those who are only a fan of action movies , but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big-budget genre and see a good art film .  this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer ( 1969's "" my night at mauds , "" and 1971's "" claire's knee "" ) that i have seen , but his direction is assured and intelligent , as is the screenplay , which he also wrote .

1|"after a rather disappointing "" mary railly "" , stephen frears is now officially back in business with a comeback worthy of praise .  this is one of the best surprises of this season -- a sweet , small budget comedy with a big heart .  in fact it's not even a comedy .  it's a drama or even more precise -- a clever satire on human relationships and needs .  based on a 1995 critically acclaimed novel by british author nick hornby , ``high fidelity'' is a wry and likable story about a man's quest for fulfillment and happiness .  rob gordon was a dj .  it seems that he could make everything spin -- except his own life .  now he owns championship vinyl , a little musical store , somewhere in new york .  when he suddenly gets dumped by his girlfriend , a gorgeous blond attorney , life suddenly looses every purpose .  decimated , humiliated and on the verge of a mental ( and emotional ) breakdown , he starts meditating over his life and the way it could have been -- about what's right and what's important .  he starts "" categorizing "" life , dividing it into "" top 5 lists "" .  and the most important is the "" top 5 list "" over the most painful breakups of his life , starting with 5th grade , when he found his young girlfriend with another boy .  though you might think that people change , grow more mature with age , it just doesn't seem that way and all rob's relationships were different versions of that first .  where did he go wrong ?  was it he that screwed up ?  or maybe life just stinks ?  while he is lost in his own self-pity , he must think of the "" top 5 list "" over his needs for the future , find the right elements and mix his life together .  with clever parallels to the cult of celebrity , music and with incredibly direct narration , it addresses the average audience member , in other words -- people like you and me .  although a lot of this honor should be addressed to the screenwriter ______ and frears , the director , the acting is equally important as the written word .  and here john cusack should absolutely be mentioned .  he is simply superb .  it is as much his movie as it is frears' .  the film would not be the same without him .  cusack -- whose character is sadder , wiser and 35 -- brings intelligence and warmth to post- mod irony .  most of his dialogue is delivered directly to the camera -- not an easy task -- but cusack pulls it off .  his interpretation feels so emotionally right , so incredibly realistic and precise that frears' message simply can't be ignored or overseen .  the other members of the cast do an equally remarkable job .  both ______ and jack black are fabulous .  even catherine zeta jones appears in a role where she actually acts , not just looks beautiful .  however , the most unexpected pleasant surprises is provided by todd louiso who delivers a spectacular comic performance as rob's co-worker and friend dick .  this is such an impressive achievement that it's almost worth a oscar-nomination .  he is simply a joy to behold .  otherwise , everyone are in their place , and at the right time -- all part of frears' colorful blend .  pretty much like edward norton's "" keeping the faith "" , this film doesn't follow any formula or belong to any genre -- it's dramatic , tragic , sarcastic , comic and even cynical , but never bitter or angry .  it's a little bit of everything , pretty much like life itself .  nothing seems unreal or staged .  it reflects reality as a mirror .  as you watch it , you go through the same emotional problems as the main character .  you feel and think and reflect .  this effect has become a rarity nowadays .  although it's primarily about the perils of love , ``high fidelity'' is secondarily about pop music .  rob owns championship vinyl and his employees , timid dick ( todd louiso ) and overbearing barry ( jack black ) , are fellow music snobs .  music is the language in their lives , the measure by which they define themselves and mark the significant events of their lives .  and so does the movie .  it is as much a musical film as anything else , as rob's journey is wonderfully portrayed through carefully inserted musical fragments .  in the end , you have gained something while watching it .  it's not the film of the century or even of the year .  it's not an special effects extravaganza .  it doesn't require big explosions or digital creatures to succeed .  it's a small movie about the big things .  and even though it does not contain heavy philosophy , you feel as if you have experienced something of significance , and you will experience that nice warm feeling for quite some time .  "|0.82|0.9166666666666666|0.9|"The review overwhelmingly expresses a positive sentiment towards the film ""High Fidelity"", praising the director, acting, and emotional impact of the story. It describes the film as a pleasant surprise, a sweet, small budget comedy with a big heart that cleverly parallels the cult of celebrity and music. The acting performances, particularly by John Cusack, are highlighted as superb, and the reviewer feels emotionally connected to the main character and the reflection of reality in the film."

1|"with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting .  the fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both .  at first glance , the matrix , larry & andy wachowski's sci-fi/kung-fu/shoot-em-up spectacular , looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high-concept bad movies , especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role .  but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue , the matrix works .  it's an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout .  reeves plays neo , a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with "" trinity "" ( carrie-anne moss ) , a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks , a unseen , omniscient cult figure known as "" morpheus "" ( lawrence fishburne ) , and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell .  neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems .  moreover , he discovers that the grim , bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it .  neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah , with grave doubts that he is actually "" the one "" prophesized to come and save the world .  reluctant or not , what follows is a mix of hong kong-style slow-motion shootouts , surreal dream sequences , high speed chases , and comic book kung-fu fights .  the film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality .  how exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ?  and if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ?  unfortunately , the matrix doesn't provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot-outs , and flying roundhouse kicks .  perhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix .  weaving's stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix .  like robert patrick as the shapeshifting t-1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny .  weaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence .  the film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography .  it seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors .  in a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny .  just seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring .  however , with the comic-book style and tone of the film , you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience .  the matrix isn't a classic .  its open-ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers .  it fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions .  it also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel-good goo that most of the film avoids .  reportedly , the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel .  unfortunately , audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future .  the matrix is an fun , enjoyable diversion , like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival .  just don't be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry .

""  i've neither read the book nor seen the movie , but i understand that the filmmakers changed some details .  in holding's story , the "" scandalous "" relationship is between an older man and margaret's teen-age daughter .  switching the gender makes the tale seem more contemporary , and it also raises questions about margaret's motives .  many reviews of "" the deep end "" describe margaret as a mother ferociously protecting her son , but i wonder .  consider this : margaret lives in a meticulously kept upscale home .  her husband is absent most of the time and seems to be regarded as a larger-than-life figure .  her father-in-law is constantly present , almost as if he is monitoring for his son .  and when her husband does call , margaret is careful not to tell him about anything disturbing that is going on with the family .  so is margaret a mother who accepts her son's sexual orientation and is simply trying to shield the young man from a lover she fears will take advantage of him ?  or is she caretaker of a museum of upper middle class complacency , desperate to maintain the status quo so that everything will be postcard perfect when the old man returns from the sea ?  you sort it out .  regardless , the resonance of "" the deep end "" comes from two actors .  goran visnjic , best known from the tv drama "" er , "" is striking as a blackmailer unlike any you've seen before .  he engages margaret in a mesmerizing dance of protocol , chivalry and simmering eroticism .  but the star of this show , without a doubt , is the remarkable tilda swinton .  watch the shadings , depth , resource , vitality and understated sexuality she gives margaret and try to imagine the film without her .  days after my second viewing of "" the deep end , "" i can still vividly picture her negotiating with villains , trying to connect with her son and diving into icy blue water .   "" the deep end "" is an exceptional film and tilda swinton is the best part of it .
