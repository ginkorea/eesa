0|" "" the beach "" is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder .  every forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme , virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act .  it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment .  but then in the second act , the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of "" blue lagoon "" .  forty minutes later , the mood changes once more , and it becomes a dumbed down version of "" lord of the flies "" where an isolated community is discovered , where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs .  by the time it's over , you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about .  the main character of "" the beach "" is angst-ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) .  he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you're looking for a good time .  richard's voice-over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown .  this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for .  he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle ) .  he seems like a raving lunatic , obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis .  though his jagged behavior would distress most of us , richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen .  moreover , the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life .  captivated by the idea , he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey .  they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise , who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richard's .  once they finally arrive at this paradise , however , the mood of the story shifts to richard's growing desire for francoise .  this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard .  etienne is about as exciting as fluffy , white sand .  it's odd that etienne never sees this coming , but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view .  and once the three stumble across the hidden community ( mood shift imminent ) , more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers .  for example , there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards .  and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark .  there are several ideas that are introduced in "" the beach "" and each one could merit its own feature-length film .  there's the man vs . nature angle , the love triangle angle , and the utopia-gone-awry angle .  but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred .  dicaprio , as a result , has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through .  consequently , the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up .  "|-0.6|0.8666666666666667|0.8166666666666668|The film is negatively perceived due to its structurally confusing and disjointed nature, as well as its weak plot and lack of clarity.
0|"the most absurd remake of 1998 ?  it's a toss up between gus van sant's psycho and mighty joe young , the new disney picture based on the old rko picture .   ( i knew i was in trouble when a polished , computer-generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits . )  there is no great demand for another giant ape movie-make that ape movie , period .   ( witness the quick deaths of buddy , born to be wild and congo . )  and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable , it's also an assembly line product through and through , lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it .  theron is jill young : as a young girl in the wilds of africa , she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers .  that baby gorilla ( nicknamed joe ) grows to immense proportions , and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him , playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers .  enter conservationist greg ( paxton ) , who convinces jill to move with joe to california , where they can protect him better in a controlled environment .  joe is restless at first ; no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l . a . , plotting joe's demise .  suffice it to say , the movie could have been called "" joe : ape in the city . ""  theron ( so good in devil's advocate ) and paxton ( so good in the recent a simple plan ) are fine actors , but not fine enough to transcend the material , a paint-by-numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising .  the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielberg's the lost world than the 1949 original , with the computer-generated t-rex-i mean , joe-wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore ; the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third , with jill shouting , "" look , joe's headed for the movie theatre ! ""  followed by a shot of joe scaling mann's chinese theater ; a moment later , jill shouts again something like "" look , joe's headed for an amusement park ! "" and what do you know , there's joe at the pallisades carnival , scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers .  the seams of last-minute edits to mighty joe young show-unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves .  the movie sure feels uneven , regardless : act two is underdeveloped , while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long , long way .  underwood ( tremors , speechless ) was perhaps not the director for the job ; even the plentiful , untamed landscape looks dull in his hands .   ( capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style . )  i did enjoy certain sequences , especially the demoliton of a black-tie dinner sequence ; and the prologue , however implausible , is touching .   ( as a tyke , joe acts just like e . t . ) rick baker's make-up effects and puppetry are outstanding , the real star of the show-yet , for all its technical flawlessness , the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love .   ( his facial expressions are variations on a scowl . )  to be fair , i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children-it's a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue .  it's certainly not a film for very young kids-intense fighting scenes may scare them , while any time joe's not on camera may bore them to tears .   ( note : older boys are more likely to be dazzled by theron's colourful array of tank tops . )  i suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing , but they sure don't make ? em like they used to .

0|"these days , we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old , cult tv shows .  most of the times , the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past .  but , some five or six years ago , there weren't that many movies and the trend didn't look that depressing .  so , the people who , like the author of this review , grew up watching flintstones , popular 1960s animated series about "" modern stone age "" family , weren't particularly worried when the word came about live action remake .  after all , the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and , if anything else , at least the special effects would be good .  the plot revolves about flintstones , family set in fictious stone age "" town "" of bedrock , whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america .  fred flinstone ( john goodman ) works in the quarry , and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble ( rick moranis ) and his wife betty ( rosie o'donnell ) to adopt a baby .  to return the favour , barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred , and , based on that , fred gets well-paid job in management .  but , of course , this is just a sham - corrupt official cliff vandercave ( kyle maclachlan ) and his sultry secretary sharon stone ( halle berry ) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme .  in the meantime , fred's wife wilma ( elizabeth perkins ) must face her mother ( elizabeth taylor ) who can't stand fred .  on the superficial level , the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life .  computer effects are flawless , and the costumes , settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show .  unfortunately , problems with this film start with inadequate casting - rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney , while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o'donnell .  but the greatest problem of all is plot , or to be precise , the lack of plot .  some thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame , original characters one-dimensional , and many elements of the story , like embezzlement and inter-office politics , totally incomprehensible for the little children , the main targeted audience of this film .  result is almost unwatchable mess , occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting ( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma ) and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as "" high concept "" .  after great hype , movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version .  all in all , film isn't that bad , but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it .

0|"after 1993's "" falling down , "" i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a great director .  since then he has offered us two so-so adaptations of john grisham novels ( "" the client "" and "" a time to kill "" ) and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise .  although these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher's potential , the publicity for his latest release , "" 8mm , "" raised new hope .  it promised to be something unusual .  it wasn't .  the plot goes like this : tom welles ( nicolas cage ) is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman , allegorically named mrs . christian ( myra carter ) , to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husband's belongings .  the movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask ( who reminds me of bane in schumacher's "" batman & robin "" ) .  because murders can be realistically simulated in movies , mrs . christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead .  by combing through missing persons reports , tom finds the girl's name and tracks her to los angeles .  with the aid of max california ( joaquin phoenix ) , a video store clerk ( and another symbolic name ) , tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff .  the plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader's "" hardcore , "" in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter .  both films are modeled on dante's "" the inferno , "" of course ; "" 8mm "" makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil .   "" hardcore "" is a much more subtle and meaningful film .   "" 8mm "" had a lot of promise .  in its better moments it's an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom .  one moment of the first sort : when we first meet max he's reading truman capote's "" in cold blood "" underneath the cover of a porn novel .   "" in cold blood "" was the father of the true-crime genre , which is the literary equivalent of snuff films .  max promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom , "" dance with the devil and the devil don't change ; the devil changes you . ""  tom does change-i'll let you discover the specifics for yourself-but not permanently .  schumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didn't have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldn't come back .   ( walker's "" seven "" did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise ) .  cage tries hard to pull it off , but the script doesn't give him enough to work with .  phoenix walks away with the movie-he's smart , charming , and funny .  other cast members include "" fargo "" 's peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and "" the sopranos "" 's james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far .  in the last analysis , since "" 8mm "" falls short of its pretensions and its promise , its just another private eye story in the raymond chandler/ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege .  however , unlike other predictable fare in the genre-last year's "" twilight , "" for example- "" 8mm "" is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is .

0|"i can imagine how good krippendorf's tribe must have looked on paper .  it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors , led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director ( todd holland ) , all wanted to make this film .  in fact , it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf's tribe as possible .  in retrospect , i can imagine how bad this film could have been .  i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss .  dreyfuss plays james krippendorf , an anthropologist who is granted $100 , 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea .  halfway into his two-year expedition , his wife ( apparently ) dies .  i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established .  later , we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big-screen tvs and other such pleasures .  so , when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely , he decides to construct an elaborate lie .  he makes his own tribe , using his three children as actors in a video .  he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe ( which he calls the shelmickedmu ) .  audiences at krippendorf's lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision .  and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community .  like all films like this , the lie becomes more and more complex , and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero .  dreyfuss is a funny , talented man , and he is funny in this film .  he has lots of positive energy and , unlike most comical actors , really manages to play people like this realistically .  this film also requires a lot of physical humor that i've never seen dreyfuss perform , and he does a great job .  jenna elfman , who plays veronica mecilli , a scientist who wants in on krippendorf's work , is also very funny and appealing here .  and the kid actors are great , as well .  but we're talking about the script from hell .  this is one of those stories that requires such extreme suspension of disbelief that they might as well have established that the story just takes place in an alternate universe where things like this can happen .  but the ridiculousness of the story is not really what is so bad about it .  all the cliches and the irritating plot devices could have easily been overcome by dreyfuss and crew .  no , the script is plagued with so many clueless stereotypes and mean-spirited characters that i was in disbelief as i watched .  furthermore , the manor in which all of this material is covered up is truly shameless .  take , for instance , the scene in which krippendorf gets veronica drunk so he can tape them having sex .  they get all decked out in the tribe getup , complete with paint to darken their skin .  krippendorf does this because he needs footage of the mating rituals of his tribe .  now , i saw this scene coming from a mile away , but i said to myself , "" no , that would be far too tasteless .  there's no way they'll do that . . . oh  god ! ""  they did do it .  it's there .  i was almost more appalled by the fact that this didn't bother the other audience members with whom i saw this film .  i found it deplorable .  and when krippendorf is forced to admit that he did it , he simply apologizes without the slightest hint of conviction in his voice .  the film is filled with scenes like these .  they not only insult the audience , but they insult the types of people that the film portrays .  it would take some truly professional work to create videos convincing enough to fool an entire community of scientists , yet krippendorf does it easily in an afternoon .  and watching dreyfuss stumble over a completely unprepared speech is funny and entertaining , but i think that most members of the on-screen audience would be able to see that he is making everything up as he goes .  if i were an anthropologist , this film would insult me immensely .  moving right along , the film plays off every stereotype our culture has ever learned regarding african tribes .  sure , dreyfuss dressing up like a chief is really funny , and it allows for some entertaining scenes , but the heart of this material is deeply clueless as to the themes and thoughts that it provokes .  it is because of dreyfuss as an actor that i was able to watch this film .  his character here is not a good subject for a film because he is a shameless liar , and never once does he show any kind of penance for what he does .  i suppose it was interesting to see the formula defied in this case , but for the purposes of good taste , i would have expected something .  no , this man sets a terrible example for his kids and colleagues , and the writer of the film ( charlie peters ) didn't include a single scene in which krippendorf takes his kids aside and tells them that what he is doing is very bad .  in fact , it's his eldest daughter that frequently tells him that he is doing the wrong thing , and he continually shrugs off her warnings .  i suppose it's important to admit that this is a funny film .  dreyfuss and elfman , and many of the contrived and insulting scenes , add up to a picture that is anything but boring .  and if you're less serious than i , you probably will enjoy it .  i , however , can't get past these elements .  krippendorf's tribe is being marketed as a family comedy , but this is the kind of film that teaches the kids of our society faulty lessons that they shouldn't be learning .  with a little more insight into its story and themes , this could have been a good movie .

0|"after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors , mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball .  fiercely unoriginal , director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him .  there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind .  the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars .  the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13 .  interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001 : a space odyssey .  instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie , de palma stops right there , refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart .  mission to mars takes it's first wobbly steps at a pre-launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done .  during these surface scans of the characters , we learn that jim mcconnell ( sinise ) has lost his wife .  it's a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety .  the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability .  there is no contentiousness , no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time .  maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff , but in that movie , the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects .  it's the year 2020 and this is nasa's first manned excursion to the red planet .  a crew , led by luke graham ( cheadle ) , arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly , which they investigate with tragic results .  graham is able to transmit a garbled distress call back to earth .  in response , earth sends a rescue team comprised of mcconnell , woody blake ( robbins ) , wife terri fisher ( nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( o'connell ) .  obstacles are put in the crew's way and and they matter-of- factly go about solving them .  i should say , mcconnell goes about solving them .  time and again , mcconnell is presented as some kind of wunderkind , which wouldn't be so bad if the rest of the crew didn't come across as so aggressivelly unremarkable .   ( mention should be made of the misogynistic handling of fisher in a situation where the entire crew's mission and life is in mortal danger .  on a team of professionals , she is portrayed as an emotion directed weak link .  women serve no purpose in the movie other than to serve as a reflection of a male character's personality trait . )  by the time they land on mars and try to solve the mystery of what occurred , mission to mars starts laying on the cliches and stilted dialogue with a heavy brush .  there is an adage in film to "" show , don't tell . ""  mission to mars does both .  repeatedly .  characters obsessively explain the obvious , explain their actions as they are doing them , explain to fellow astronauts facts which should be fundamental knowledge to them .  the film's conclusion is momumentally derivative , anti-climatic and unsatisying .  as i walked out i wondered who the target audience might be for this film .  the best i could come up with is pre-teen age boys , but in this media saturated era , this film's components would have been old hat even for them .  i have to think what attracted such talent to this film was the lure of making a good , modern day b-movie .  the key to such a venture is a certain depth and sincerity towards the material .  i felt no such earnestness .

0|"some movies ask you to leave your brain at the door , some movies ask you to believe in the impossible to really have a good time .  playing god asks just one simple , eensy , teensy thing so it can fully entertain you , it's accomplished in just four easy to follow steps : crack open your skull , scoop out your brain , squish it under your foot several times and reverse steps two and one .  congratulations , you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing .  some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie , others are simply good ideas that are badly executed .  then there's playing god , which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director , actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip-offs ( or homages as they like to call it ) from other , better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet .  harsh ? maybe .  justified ?  hell yes !  this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes .  for example , a gunman bursts into a garden with the two guns in his hands firing away .  this does look moderately kool , but the camera lingers on the actor for so long you can almost hear the director yelling : "" oooh , look look !  john woo !  two guns blazing !  slooooow motion !

( term used as loosely as possible )  survival instincts and a good dose of common sense seems to suggest grabbing the shotgun , which our hero does , but only after contemplating it for about thirty seconds .  even when he does grab it he seems unsure how to hold it , going so far as to actually wonder if he should place a finger near the trigger .  mind you , i've never fired a shotgun in my life but believe you me that the bad guy would be missing most of his vital organs , be he stoned or not .  some will argue that our hero does not have a killer instinct , the hell with that !  two fbi guys have just been shot in front me , along with one bad guy and the other looks like he might go ballistic at any second .  solution ?  boom !  i'll take the time to feel sorry about it later thank you very much .  another prime example of the idiot hero syndrome :  our boy duchovny needs to reach his girl before something bad happens to her .  he knows the head bad guy has her on the tenth floor of a building and that he might be running into a room full of people with itchy trigger fingers .  he still has his shotgun , bring it along you say ?  no thanks , i'll just ditch it in the back of my car .  and the real kicker is this : when he reaches the room and people start shooting at him he has the nerve to look surprised !  while we are on the subject of getting shot , why in hades were those fbi guys sitting with their backs to the door ?  i've got no formal training but even i know you never sit with your back to the door .  ask mr . wild bill , the first and only time he did not sit with his back to a wall cost him his life .  this is the major problem with this movie , any mook could have thought of a hundred ways to make it better .  is it so much to ask that hollywood actually put a little common sense into their characters ?  for instance :  our heroes hide at duchovny's summer home , now the bad guys could come knocking at any moment .  ok , this time our hero does get himself a gun and has it at his side most of the time .  but see , our hero is a drug addict and guess what ?  he chooses now to go clean and suffer through dt .  oh sure , he'll be really impressive when the bad guys come calling .  going clean is really honorable of him , but i would have waited until i did not need to be conscious or being able to fire a gun .  for an enjoyable performance by timothy hutton , plot holes the size of godzilla , getting our intelligence insulted and several "" oh come on !

0|" "" america's sweethearts "" has an intriguing premise and a great cast , but it isn't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be .  almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co-script writer billy crystal , who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co-hosting "" comic relief "" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg ( two other paragons of self-indulgence ) .  crystal ignores a simple , but crucial , rule : for a screwball comedy to work , the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting , because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous .   "" america's sweethearts "" takes place at a press junket , where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters .  it's a promising set-up , but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules , thus dissipating the tension of the situation .  by the end of the film , all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on , but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed .  john cusack and catherine zeta-jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison , a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector ( hank azaria ) , a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp .  of the last nine films eddie and gwen made together , six crossed the $100 million mark , but the prospects for their final effort , a space opus titled "" time over time , "" are far from rosy .  while eddie has spent many months in a new age rest clinic fretting over the breakup , gwen's solo films have tanked .  to make matter worse , the director of the movie ( christopher walken ) , a "" visionary "" who purchased the unabomber's cabin and had it moved to his backyard , is withholding the film from the studio , insisting that the first screening be held at the junket .  desperate to win over the press , the studio elects to hire lee ( billy crystal ) , a recently fired publicist , to salvage the situation .  lee hopes to turn lemons into lemonade by convincing eddie and gwen to pretend to be on the road to reconciliation .  he enlists the help of kiki ( julia roberts ) , gwen's sister , personal assistant and whipping girl .  what lee doesn't know is that kiki is in love with eddie , a fact that could temper her effectiveness .  press junkets are a haven for control freaks .  studios fly journalists in from around the world and put them up in a plush hotel , with food and drink always at hand .  generally , on the evening of their arrival , writers are bussed to see the featured film , then ferreted straight back to the hotel .  the next day , writers go to the studio suites and assemble in groups of five or six for roundtable interviews .  every 30 minutes or so , a producer , director , writer or actor is brought into the room for a few minutes of questions , with a publicist hovering in the corner to keep an eye on things .  the atmosphere is one of cordial oppression ? writers are free to ask what they want , but understand that if the studio dislikes a question , they may not be invited to future junkets .  representatives from tv stations face even more restrictions .  they get roughly five minutes to interview each member of the cast and crew , with the studio filming the exchanges .  the "" reporters "" are notorious for tossing softball questions as they suck up to the stars , but to play it safe , the studios stand ready to erase the tapes if anything unpleasant occurs .  placing two spoiled actors in a setting where image is everything is inspired , but the screenplay undermines the conceit .  the junket is moved from the handsome , but highly confining , four seasons hotel to a plush resort near las vegas .  for most of the film , the movie stars run around the sprawling grounds , completely safe from the eyes of the press .  when they do deal with journalists , the "" it is imperative that you be on your best behavior in front of the reporters "" premise is de-clawed .  gwen and eddie insult each other while the tv cameras roll , they scream at each other in a restaurant filled with the media and , at the screening of the movie , everyone connected with the film goes nuts , all without any repercussions .  lee certainly isn't bothered by any of the infantile outbursts ; in fact , he makes arrangements for footage of even more inappropriate behavior to be delivered to the tabloids .  is the studio angry about his handling of the combative actors ?  hell no ? they feel lee is a genius for garnering so much publicity for the movie .  all of which underscores how billy crystal and co-writer peter tolan screwed up their own premise : the comedy in "" america's sweethearts "" is based on barely-in-control people trying to contain themselves in the presence of reporters , except that it doesn't matter because any publicity is good publicity .  and thus the very set-up for the film implodes , leaving smoke and dust in place of laughter .  so what about the cast ?  julia roberts , at her best playing the underdog , is utterly charming here , although i could have lived without flashbacks that exist solely as an excuse to show her in a fat suit ( and not a very convincing one , by the way ) .  catherine zeta-jones makes a believable brat and john cusack fleshes out his obsessed character enough to make him vaguely sympathetic .  by casting himself as the publicist , billy crystal allows himself to do roughly the same thing he does on "" comic relief "" - stay on the sidelines of the action while tossing off cornball jokes and snarky remarks .  in supporting roles , hank azaria wears out his welcome fast with broad gestures and a spanish accent that speedy gonzales would have deemed "" too broad . ""  seth green is amusing as a toadie , stanley tucci is very good as a ruthless studio head and christopher walken plays the eccentric director with suitable flair , though he has little to work with .  come to think of it , "" little to work with "" is the operative phrase for this movie .  as a hollywood satire , "" america's sweethearts "" is toothless .  as a romance , it is at best a minor pleasure .  such a good cast , such a waste of their efforts .  had it not been taken long ago , a better title for the film would have been "" much ado about nothing .

0|do the folks at disney have no common decency ?  they have resurrected yet another cartoon and turned it into a live action hodgepodge of expensive special effects , embarrassing writing and kid-friendly slapstick .  wasn't mr . magoo enough , people ?  obviously not .  inspector gadget is not what i would call ideal family entertainment .  younger viewers will likely be taken in by the abounding goofiness , but their adult companions may feel a wave of nausea sweeping over them as they attempt to endure this appalling 80-minute exercise in glaring stupidity .  the movie is poorly edited , grossly manipulative , and the finished product resembles somewhat of a failed jigsaw puzzle .  all the elements are there , but the manner in which director david kellogg pieces them together is laughable and trite .  as a huge fan of the 80's animated tv show , the first thing i must express is my anger toward the treatment of the main villain .  in the cartoon , dr . claw was a frightening , raspy-voiced presence who remained a total mystery to the viewer .  we never saw his face ; he simply sat back in his arm-chair , watching surveillance cameras and gently stroking his loyal cat .  as a child , i always imagined what dr . claw would appear as - and this curiosity kept me watching for many years .  with the release of the live-action movie , the face of this once intriguing villain has been unrightfully exposed - it's . . .  rupert everett ? !  only now , dr . claw is simply known as claw ( `one word , ' he explains , `like madonna' ) .  he sports a shiny clamp instead of the steel glove , and seems far less interesting than the animated version .  it helps that the dashing everett is enthusiastic , but he overplays the role entirely too far .  when all is said and done , this wasn't a very wise move on the part of the screenwriters - the infamous dr . claw has been turned into a wisecracking game show host who makes cheap attempts at being suave and cool .  he does still have his cat , though .  in the title role , matthew broderick looks lost .  the actor , while usually downright charming , doesn't know exactly where to take his character - a fault that again can be blamed on the hapless writers .  broderick first plays a friendly , naive security guard named john brown , who dreams of becoming a cop and upholding the law for the good of the people .  he has a mad crush on pretty scientist brenda ( joely fisher ) , who has stumbled upon a new wave of technology involving the interaction of human tissue and electronics .  but one fateful night , her lab is destroyed and her experiment is stolen by a fiendish millionaire ( everett ) who wants to take over the world .  john courageously pursues the limousine from the scene of the crime , but loses the chase when his vehicle bursts into flames .  in a full body cast , he is chosen to be the first human prototype for brenda's work ; a revolutionary crime fighting tool with numerous fancy gadgets to dispatch bad guys .  and so is born inspector gadget .  as bad as this movie is , it does have a certain charm in isolated scenes .  broderick actually fares better playing robo gadget , an evil and destructive clone that claw has set loose on the city .  and there are about two or three amusing punch lines , the funniest being when robo gadget impersonates a rampaging monster with shadow puppets on a brick wall , and a japanese man flees the scene while screaming , `this is why i left tokyo ! '  alas , the hit ratio of the ongoing gags is about 20 to 1 in favor of not even cracking a slight giggle .  there are so many tired plot additions .  gadget's talking car ( voiced by d . l .  hughley ) is the same type of character as zoot the suit from my favorite martian .  both are wisecracking , non-human additions designed to coax laughter from smaller children .  well , it just doesn't work ( in fact , zoot functioned marvelously in comparison to this ) .  and don't even get me started about the villains .  i didn't mind everett's performance , but his bumbling assistants will make every adult cringe with disgust .  the characters from the cartoon have been reduced to thankless supporting roles .  penny ( michelle trachtenberg ) and brain the dog now have little to do with the action , and chief quimby ( dabney coleman ) has lost considerable appeal in the transition of animation to live action .  the special effects are everywhere , but not so annoying they will cause your eyes to peel over .  the problem here lies solely in the script .  perhaps the next time disney attempts a remake like this , they will invest more in the screenplay than the fancy-schmancy visuals .  here is one critic crossing his fingers , anyway .  |-0.85|0.8666666666666667|0.9|"The summary explanation is that the user has a highly negative sentiment towards the Disney live-action movie ""Inspector Gadget.""

0|synopsis : two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry ( woody harrelson ) - - an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post , tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye , has ill-timed fits of coughing , and fails at everything he does .  the story is told from harry's point of view .  harry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn't drink .  one day harry is approached by the con girl rhea ( elisabeth shue ) , who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesn't smoke .  seduced , harry agrees to participate in a money-making scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette ( chloe sevigny ) , the teenage daughter of a rich man .  turns out , it's all part of a needless , very puzzling , extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme ( it involves hiring special impersonators ) by two cons in order to fool harry , a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post .  when the 'kidnapped' odette is found dead , the clues point to harry as the kidnapper/murderer , and the police are hot on harry's trail .  harry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money .  can he get out of this mess ?  opinion : palmetto is a long , uninteresting film with all the wrong feel .  hero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence .  this farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof .  but palmetto is played like a dark , serious , detective noir drama , and watching harry's bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction .  there's a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts , buttocks , short skirts , colored painted nails , and women's legs .  even when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema , you can always notice the side of elizabeth shue's breast forming a prominent foreground .  towards the end , palmetto re-focuses on plot for the grand finale - - a confusing explanation involving impersonators , with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals' confession .  if you can imagine 'shemp' from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo 'lingerie suspense' thriller , that's how out of synch this movie feels .  |-0.8166666666666668|0.9|0.8000000000000002|"The reviews generally convey a negative sentiment towards the movie ""Palmetto"".

0|starring arnold schwarzenegger ; danny devito ; emma thompson & frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment , and a big one at that .  junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman .  these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins .  so foolish me , i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins .  so much for hopes .  schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists ( doctors hesse and arbogast ) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy .  unfortunately , due to circumstances beyond their control , they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans , and subsequently lose their funding .  still believing that their drug will work , they decide to test it anyway , on hesse .  so , dr . hesse ( schwarzenegger ) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug .  their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying , surely it will work on a woman .  does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you ?  well , it must have to the producers of junior .  admittedly , schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off .  perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny .  but it wasn't , schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best .  the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy , and the accompanying emotional swings , is not funny .  schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics .  i kept thinking to myself , with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture .  better yet , with schwarzenegger , devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time , why didn't they make a sequel to twins ?  anything would have been better than this mess .  danny devito is wasted in this movie .  his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street .   ( after seeing the movie , if i was devito , i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street . )  emma thompson is wasted here as well .  while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations , she is also a fine comedian .  too bad she didn't get to use any of that talent here .  am i being too hard on this film ?  i don't think so .  schwarzenegger and devito are two of my favorite actors in film today , and ivan reitman is one of the more talented directors in hollywood .  with a supporting cast of emma thompson and frank langella , the filmmakers really have to be trying hard to make a bad film .  they certainly managed here .  maybe it was well intentioned , but unfortunately this is a movie that never should have been made .  if you are tempted to see this film , do yourself a favor and go rent twins , a film that truly takes advantage of arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito's comedic talents .  |-0.8833333333333334|0.85|0.9166666666666666|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is negative, highlighting disappointment, frustration, and criticism towards the movie ""Junior"" due to a mismatch of talent and wasted potential."
0|"there are scenes in "" the big hit "" that are so awful , they simply defy description .  the movie is infected with the same kind of blunderheaded idiocy and misplaced confidence that made "" last action hero "" ( 1993 ) such a chore to sit through .  presumably , "" the big hit "" is an action-comedy , a difficult but not impossible genre to pull off .  movies of this sort require a fine balance and careful tone , and the comedy is usually meant to work as catharsis for the violence .   "" lethal weapon 2 "" ( 1989 ) is a perfect example of an action thriller that was also very , very funny .  unfortunately , in "" the big hit , "" it seems that comedy is the main motive , and the violence is only intended to punctuate the laughs .  unfortunately , there are no laughs .  the movie resembles some of the goofy , throwaway ridiculousness of early jackie chan films , but it doesn't benefit from chan's incredible stunts and goofy , charismatic presence .  instead , we are left with a lot of digital effects and mark wahlberg , who must have considered himself invincible after his critically-acclaimed performance in last year's "" boogie nights . ""  however , if he wants to maintain a decent career , he had better start selecting his projects more carefully - movies like this are a sure-fire recipe for a long career in the straight-to-video market .  wahlberg plays melvin smiley , an amiable guy who also happens to be a professional hitman ( see "" grosse pointe blank "" for the same character , much better developed ) .  the movie wants us to think , "" gee how clever and ironic - a guy who can kill without any moral implications , and yet he can't stand for anyone not to like him . ""  the fact is , melvin is so desperate to keep people from not liking him , that he puts up with both an obnoxious fiancee ( christina applegate , with a horrendous new york accent ) and an abusive girlfriend ( lela rochon ) who is only using him for his money .  his constant bending over backwards to please people makes him a complete patsy at best , and a thoroughly unbelievable character at worst .  melvin is employed exclusively by a crime boss named paris ( avery brooks ) as part of a team of hitmen , which also includes cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) and crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) .  one day , melvin agrees to do some moonlighting with cisco by kidnapping the teenage daughter of a rich japanese mogul named jiro nishi ( sab shimono ) for a million dollar ransom .  however , not only has jiro nishi lost all his money producing a big hollywood movie ( inside joke , get it ? ) , but his kidnapped daughter , keiko ( china chow ) , also happens to be paris' goddaughter .  so , when paris finds out she's been kidnapped , he takes it personally and becomes determined to find out who did it .  not knowing the cisco is actually behind the whole scheme , paris puts him in charge of rooting out the kidnapper .  of course cisco blames the whole thing on poor , innocent melvin .  along the way , there are several obligatory gunfights , explosions , and car chases , plus a literal cliffhanger inspired by "" jurassic park , "" and a completely unconvincing romance between melvin and keiko ( who looks like she's barely pushing fifteen ) .  what the movie passes off as humor resorts to thoroughly unfunny jokes about overweight jewish mothers , hara-kiri , drinking problems , leaking body bags , and a running gag about how crunch has recently discovered the pleasures of masturbation , and now spends all his time doing hand exercises .  not to mention the pimply video store clerk who is always calling melvin and screeching about how he needs to return his copy of "" king kong lives , "" which is two weeks overdue .  this mess of a movie was helmed by che-kirk wong , the latest hong kong director imported by john woo ( "" face/off "" ) , who also served as executive producer .  woo needs to stop acting as a conduit for other directors , and start making more of his own films .  wong , who directed such films as "" rock'n'roll cop "" back in hong kong , is completely tone deaf when it comes to comedy .  maybe jokes about vexatious video clerks and vomiting on other people are funny across the ocean , but they're not here , at least in the manner wong handles them .  many of the problems can be traced back to the script , which was penned by obvious freshman writer ben ramsey .  in addition to his vague characterizations and uninspired action sequences , ramsey's script assaults the audience with his attempts to copy the vulgar , poetic rhythms of tarantino or mamet-style dialogue .  what he comes out with is just a lot of annoying blather , most of which spews from the lips of lou diamond phillips ( whose favorite phrase is "" it's all love "" ) and robin dunne , who plays cisco's stuttering , black-wannabe assistant .  the irritation factor of phillips and dunne combined is almost off the scale , which can pretty much describe the film as a whole .

0|"well i guess it's that time of the year again .  the one time of the year where movie craftors are exonerated from the need to even * try * writing a script that has more dialogue than explosions .  it's also the best time for the handful of existing bigtime hollywood mr action heroes to dust off their miniscule vocabularies , pull on their black vests and charge onto our screens tersely expirating what they hope will become memorable catchphrases .  in america they call this time "" summer "" and it happens once every year .  and maybe it's the exposure to all that nasty sun that does it , but in the process normally weak , insipid lines like "" consider this a divorce , "" "" hasta la vista , baby , "" and "" you're the disease .  i'm the cure "" actually do end up being repeated more often then the phrases from my book of biblical proverbs .  this is not entirely a bad thing , of course .  what am i talking about ?  i'm talking about the summer "" blockbusters , "" the "" action thrillers , "" the "" this-obviously-cost-a-lot-so-you-know- everyone's-going-to-go "" explosions , gas threats , flying saucers , and special effects .  in the rash of "" my , what big guns you have , but wait !  mine are bigger "" movies , there are also the usual boy-meets-fish-and-saves-environment movies ( or whale , whatever ) , and * this * year , the odd crop of "" save-the-world-from-aliens-or-environment- threats "" offerings .  i'm talking about the three batmans , the speeds , the terminators , etc . this year i'm talking about twister , independence day , the arrival , the rock , mission : impossible , and of course , eraser .  here in singapore , as our local movie critics like to whine , we seem to get the pick of the crop of "" my explosion is more real-looking than yours "" movies , but nothing else .  mission : impossible opened in our theatres almost as soon as it did in the us .  the same goes for eraser , which is unfortunate for arnold schwarzenegger because coming so soon after what time magazine recently called "" mission : unavoidable "" ( on account of its worldwide mega-advertising blitz ) , eraser seems like a cheaper , less thoughtful imitation .  that's saying a lot , because mi the movie was already a cheap , thoughtless imitation of its tv originator of the '60s/'70s .  in eraser , arnie is a us federal marshall who relocates trial witnesses whose testimonies place their lives in danger .  he does this by destroying all evidence of their present existence and re-situating them with new identities .  his new case is lee cullen , played by vanessa williams who , unlike all the other scumbags he's ever relocated , is "" an actual , real life honest person . ""  because she's so good , and has such nice legs , arnold spends the whole movie trying to protect her , and only uses the opening movie sequence to save robert pastorelli from * his * killers .  lee obtains evidence that the high-technology weapons company she works for is secretly selling sophisticated , black-market arms to people with foreign accents and stringy hair .  of course , as the formula goes , her revealing this information will destroy the system as we know it because heck , there are people in high places who will go down with this , because yes , this is the biggest conspiracy in the history of the world ( that is , america ) since watergate .  in protecting lee , arnold is framed by the mentor-turned-evil robert deguerin , nicely played by james caan , and ends up having to prove that he isn't the one killing the programme's witnesses in addition to making sure lee isn't accidentally torpedo-ed to death by the new , green guns his enemies all have .  it's around this time that people in the theatre with me starting humming the mission : impossible theme , because arnie's mission includes breaking into a high-security building to run a disk .  i guess i should tell you more about the particular gun everyone in this movie is so antsy about .  it's an electro-magnetic pulse gun thing which fires aluminium missiles , and which can see through walls .  it has some sort of x-ray vision , so its user can target the victim's heart even from great distances .  despite this , which i figure is a pretty cool feature in a gun ( though i'm certainly no expert ) , however , arnold , whose own heart is targeted a number of times , * never * goes flying 10 feet backwards with a two-foot missile through his chest like all the others who get shot by this gun .  instead he outruns and outsmarts his trackers each time , giving eery and ironic resonance to that terminator line that practically made him famous : "" i'll be back . ""  like everyone else in the theater , i left the movie feeling that the trailers had duped me , because they made me want to watch this movie voluntarily .  although there is a * lot * of violence in this movie , not to mention mutilation and some bloody tussles with alligators , i recommend this movie to most over-18s who need some therapeutic mindless action to get over the weirdness of fargo or the hangover effect of leaving las vegas .  review's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

0|"tim burton has now completed his evolution from the brilliant director of macabre stories about outcast individuals yearning for acceptance , and into a studio monkey whose name is used as part of multi-tiered marketing materials for crap movies .  and here he hits rock bottom , with planet of the apes .  i didn't expect much from this latest "" interpretation "" of pierre boulle's classic novel planet of the apes .  i mean , how could you top the force and impact of the original film , intelligently co-scripted by rod serling ( of twilight zone fame ) combined with the overbearing chuck heston growling and yelling at those "" damn dirty apes , "" in one of his best roles of his career ?  sadly , i sat down to watch burton's version of planet of the apes and within the first 20 minutes , i was checking my watch and my girlfriend ( a big fan of the original film ) started to nod off .  this time around , the story plays out like a cross between enemy mine , braveheart , and project x . marky mark wahlberg , who was enjoyable in boogie nights and the corrupter , plays leo davidson , a hot shot u . s . air force pilot .  leo and his crew are in search of some mysterious magnetic storms ( no real explanation given in the film ) and leo sends one of his genetically altered "" smart "" chimps into the storms to collect data .  leo and his crew lose communication with the chimp , leo hops in another ship to find the monkey , and then he's thrown through some type of time-space wormhole which crashes lands on the twentieth century fox studio backlot , all mocked up to look like the amazon jungle .  leo ends up getting captured by a group of talking apes and is sold to a slave trader named limbo ( paul giamatti ) who in turn sells leo to a chimpanzee named ari ( helena bonham carter ) .  the kind ari then helps leo and his fellow humans escape to the mountains to find leo's ship .  along the way , monkeys played by tim roth ( overacting his role of a vicious general named thade ) and michael clarke duncan ( who further enhances his career by playing another heavy in a bad action movie ) strive out to hunt down leo and his band of human savages , just like battlefield earth !  in the end , it all culminates into another braveheart rip-off human versus ape battle scene .  while rick baker's makeup work is amazing , the script is a pathetic hodgepodge ( courtesy of three writers ) , the acting is horrible , and the "" surprise "" ending feels like a swing from a ball-peen hammer into the temple .  wahlberg does not have the physical or mental presence of a chuck heston to carry the film or any of its action sequences .  this remake , or re-interpretation , as tim burton has proclaimed it , is an insult to the intelligence and wit of the original film .  the ethical arguments about the equality of species , fascism , and military buildup have been replaced by tremendous amounts of ridiculous dialogue , an unimaginative narrative structure , and a romance between a monkey and a human .  even chuck heston's anti-gun tirade ( in the de rigeur cameo ) seems shallow and jokey .  but the main element missing from this tim burton film is tim burton .  even though his name is plastered across every billboard in america , john badham could have directed this film .  even joel schumacher could have directed this film .  he probably should have .  burton's predominant themes of rejection , isolation , and the search for one's place in the universe , as seen in ed wood , edward scissorshands , and pee-wee's big adventure , are completely absent in this planet .  i suppose that's what happen when a great director gets sucked through a wormhole .

""  the plot is recycled buddy-buddy comedy-thriller tripe that seemed overused even when "" nothing to lose "" employed it last month .  everything is paint-by-numbers , especially the los angeles coliseum finale , which finds not one , not two , but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers .  the villains , as many as there are , are dull .  certain story elements are too coincidental .  and too much of the film's dramatic agenda is played too straight .  a scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin's true identity ( "" you brought a killer into my parents' house !

0|" "" soldier "" , by director paul anderson , is a film in which any presence of originality is fleeting .  the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel's character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision .  brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it , and the opening scenes tap into it a little .  then it goes nowhere with that idea .  there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization , and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches i've ever seen .  the whole idea of the inhuman , soldier-type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done , and it's been done much better .  i was able to predict the plot of the _whole_ story , which wouldn't be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting .  between the action sequences , it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr . russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes , since his dialog is extremely limited .  his performance in that way isn't all that bad , but certainly is not enough to carry this film .  other performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all , and they generally are about as weak as their characters .  but enough of this stuff about plot and character , right ?  isn't the most important part of an action film , well , the action ?  even in this aspect the film is a disappointment .  in mortal kombat ( 1995 ) , director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining .  however , he fails to repeat that in this film .  the combat scenes , particularly the big one at the end , is incredibly unimaginatve .  fighting and combat scenes are supposed to bring about thrills in this type of movie , a point which even an otherwise unimpressive film like starship troopers seemed to realize .  but instead of reaching for something truly interesting to end the film with , it goes for the old , shoot-em up , one guy vs . an army type of cinema that i thought died with the military action films of the 80s .  if the film went with some of the ideas it opened up with the introduction more seriously , it could have been a rather engaging science fiction film .  however , it utterly failed to go in any new directions after that , making the film a big disappointment .
