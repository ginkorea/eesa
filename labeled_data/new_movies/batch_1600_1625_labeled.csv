0|"silly performances and some huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise interesting tale of an eclectic group of people stranded at "" the last stop cafe and motel "" due to heavy snowfall .  one of the stranded is a colorado state highway patrolman ( adam beach ) who discovers a murder scene and a bag full of cash from a recent bank robbery .  someone amongst the group of strangers is a bank robber and a murderer , but is it the same person or are there multiple criminals ?  adam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film .  he doesn't play the role with enough seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness for it to be funny .  his performance is stuck somewhere in the middle , and this film really needed it to be on one side or the other .  rose mcgowan is cold and unpleasant to the eye as always , and jurgen prochnow . . .  what on earth is he doing in this ?  best performance comes from william s . taylor as a cheesy ( yet still somehow cool and confident ) wayne newton drifter type .  the last stop is available on dvd from sterling home entertainment .  as usual with sterling , they've filled out this dvd with extra features .  the disc contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , a choice of 2 . 0 dolby surround sound or 5 . 1 dolby digital surround sound , a full length audio commentary track with director mark malone , interviews with the cast and crew , the original trailer , and the usual cast and crew biographies .  the film itself might not be the greatest , but sterling's effort of adding decent extra features while keeping the price affordable ( suggested retail of $19 . 95 ) makes this dvd worth the money .

0|an affluent horse breeder's past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices .  that's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow .  that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source .  the acting in particular i found very good , the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie .  a few things about the story didn't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone , yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better .  on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot .  the character's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing .  as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener .  all these people acted their parts admirably , as for the part that sharon stone played , she played it well but the part was not utilized enough .  the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie , this is one of those occasions .  matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldn't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ) .  there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this .  the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing , the subject matter in my opinion wasn't interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it .  i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself don't like it .  all in all i found this movie boring and very slow , the acting was good but the story just didn't evolve enough and wasn't captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch .  although there is much going for the movie i didn't find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them .  i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie .  |-0.15|0.7999999999999999|0.7666666666666666|The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly negative, with the movie being criticized for being boring, slow, and lacking in story and pacing.

0|"a fullyloaded entertainment review : website coming soon !  hunter s . thompson's fear and loathing in las vegas , written in 1971 , is already an american classic ; not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post-psychedelia of the 1960's , but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as "" gonzo "" .  soon after the book was written , hunter s . thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke .  and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas ( the movie . )  although the book is one of my favorites , i now agree with thompson's own assessment of the novel as "" unfilmable . ""  the main problem is that the book , although detailing wild drug use and tripped-out adventures , was not written on the road .  it was written and edited by hunter s . thomspons , relatively sober , at his home .  so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use , it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor .  hunter s . thomspon , the narrator , while always drugged out , still has a grip on reality , and can still tell , with journalistic ability , what is going on around him .  not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas .  despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped , the movie is an exact duplicate of the book , in terms of dialouge .  unfortunately , this can get annoying , in the form of johnny depp's ( who plays thompson ) excessive narration .  and the characters , while having vivid personalities , are played as 2-d characers on the screen : dr . raoul duke ( johnny depp , the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson's ) and his riding companion , dr . gonzo ( benicio del toro ) , who is a large samoan lawyer , have no personalities or emotions at all , save for stoned .  the film is very faithful to the plot ( what there is ) of the book , in that dr . raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400 , and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs .  from there , one set of stoned adventures after another happens , including one of the few good scenes in which depp , high on acid , watches all the people in the bar around him turn into , literally , lounge lizards .  while the movie has its moments ( few ) , it is almost unwatchable at parts , especially towards the end .  despite a lot of celebrity cameos , the stars never get off the ground .  the set decoration and costumes are great , and probably deserve an oscar nomination .  however , as we all know , it's not sets or effects that make a movie , its the characters ; and quite frankly , these characters are no good .

0|filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull , dreary , and overused idea .  doug liman ( swingers ) , director of the ultra-hip and severely dark comedy go , is an example of just such a filmmaker .  in his latest , he gives the viewers a raucous , neon-lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested path of misadventure as director .  but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level , bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same .  his movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from multiple ( three ) points of view , much as an author might write a serial novel .  consistent with this ethic , liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives .  the thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter .  in story a we have checkout clerk ronna ( sarah polley ) looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it ; in story b we have regular drug dealer simon ( desmond askew ) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity ; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack ( jay mohr ) and adam ( scott wolf ) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal .  neither of the three stories have much substance , and the movie has the feel of a campfire story ( albeit a rather strange one ) that could be told in five to ten minutes .   ( in fact , the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . )  the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movie's christmas setting , and the los angeles/las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to .  the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite , and performances from little-known players like polley , askew , and taye diggs don't help or hurt the roles .  in fact , even bigger names like mohr , wolf , and katie holmes don't have enough time to make substantial success .  although that's almost expected for lack of continuous screen time , the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories .  go doesn't have this , and it suffers because of it .  as far as teen movies are concerned , go represents the absolute bottom , for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme .   ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals , people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers , people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives , or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . )  at times , the humor in go is sickly funny , and on a low night , almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers , this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night .  |-0.7166666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|The text is primarily negative, criticizing the film's use of tricks, lack of parallel structure, and shallow characters, while also mentioning the absence of a common theme and lack of enjoyment for most viewers except for a few darkly funny moments.
0|"i feel sorry for the financial backers of "" waterworld , "" which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made ( at $172 million ! ) , and is also one of the stupidest - boy did they get ripped off !  in fact , this film is not really a movie , but more of an amusement park ride with a plot .  it's not even just another case of cliches strung together ( well , it is that too ) , it's something that's painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws .  kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man/half fish .  he is an explorer/mariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted .  he's referred to as the mariner , but they "" the meaner "" would have been a more appropriate title because he's cold , rigid , and strict - and he's supposed the be the good guy !  he docks at a small floating village of sorts .  he trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters .  first we meet one of the villains , then the soon-to-be heroine , a child prodigy , a wacky inventor , and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today , but also some of the low-tech tools used by pirates and vikings .  immediately the film's biggest flaw is apparent : are these people primitive or highly advanced ?  it doesn't seem like anyone can read yet they have ski-doos and airplanes !  how are these things powered ?  and if they have airplanes , couldn't they just keep flying until they reached dry land ?  also , if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things ?  i'm sorry , i'm all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies , but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us .  there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology , so why mix the two together ?  it doesn't make any sense .  there really isn't much of a plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything .  the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child , enola ( mojorino ) , has a tattoo on her back that is supposedly a map to "" dryland .

0|to watch `battlefield earth' is to wallow in misery .  it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history .  it has a clumsily told story , insipid dialogue , shallow characterizations , ugly scene transitions , no evidence of dramatic arc , headache-inducing sound effects , and a resolution that is completely implausible .  worse , there's the promise of a sequel .  why ? !  save your money .  some films go quickly to video .  this one , however , should go straight to the sci-fi channel's `mystery science theatre . '  in the year 3000 , man has become an endangered species .  most of humanity ( called ? man-animals' ) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens ( called psychlos ) .  survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earth's resources for the rest of their lives .  the aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine-feet tall , who resemble inbred klingons .  dimwitted as they are tall , their culture is predicated on power , extortion , and getting ? leverage . '  travolta , the leverage-using star , plays terl , the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth .  much of the movie is spent showing us examples of terl's petty machinations .  he routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter .  but one thing is certain ; he hates being stationed on earth .  when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet , he begins to devise his latest plan .  he will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site .  it's not clear how this benefits terl , except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it .  the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry peppers ) is selected as the slave group's leader .  a psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know-how .  but the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language , the principles of our founding fathers , euclidean geometry , and the location of fort knox .  this enlightenment just doesn't prepare him for the mining assignment .  it also prepares him to organize and stage a massive revolt against their captors .  `we're going to blow up their home world , ' he says .  `but first , we need a few more supplies . '  in days , he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling , loincloth wearing , rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts .  by now , the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl .  the media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travolta's labor of love is a piece of sci-fi drivel .  numerous journals have called it an ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris , arrogance , and poor planning .  and after watching this movie , you'll wholeheartedly agree .  this is a terrible film that is illogically constructed , tediously acted , and frequently begs the question : why was this ever made ?  at a price tag of $90 million , this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly , assuredly becoming `the avengers' of this summer .  both films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity .  in addition to the universally pejorative reviews , there's another bizarre element to the `battlefield' saga .  this film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta , who for over a decade , had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen .  the controversy is that travolta is a scientologist , and `battlefield' is based on a 1982 novel by l . ron hubbard , the religion's late founder .  this led some to believe that `battlefield earth' would amount to scientologist dogma , laden with subliminal messages .  but the story is so poorly told that any message , subliminal or otherwise , is totally undetectable .  if the audience got anything out of this film , it was this : we are not too unlike the psychlo leader .  like terl , the audience felt imprisoned , dreaded their situation , and looked for any opportunity to leave .  could that be the scientology message ?  |-0.8666666666666667|0.9666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|"The movie ""Battlefield Earth"" is described in highly negative terms, with critics pointing out flaws in its story, dialogue, characters, scene transitions, sound effects, and resolution.

0|" "" you can't have any of this .  it's all mine ! ""  --- a twisted priest ( charles huevelman ) hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana ( angela zimmerly ) looks on uninterested .  an evil presence , appropriately named the presence ( dj vivona ) , rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him .  for kicks , the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered .  when something goes wrong and one of the presence's recent victims escapes , the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped .  they enlist the help of alison ( ramona midgett ) , a recent suicide victim , to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether-realm .  her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was , an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed .  the king's sorcerer , amblyn ( who also lost his job ) , decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice .  during the downtime in his unemployment , amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery , evil , and torture ruled .  abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm , so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love .  in this new realm , amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm .  after each murder , abraham would become stronger , until his power surpassed that of amblyn's .  because of the screw-up that allowed the recent escape , abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself .  as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways , the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered .  if there's one thing i can't stand when i see a film , it's when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty .  films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this , and now ice from the sun can be added to this list .  this film is essentially an 80 minute stalk-and-slash film ( following the dante's inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images , many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot .  if there aren't bizarre images floating past the screen , then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone .  compelling , but ultimately not .  the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images .  the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesn't pop up until near the end of the sequence .  when the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv .  at least the music in the film is pretty decent , made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett .  at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them ( and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing ) .  for some reason though , he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance .  one over-alled cretin handles the presence's gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel , then there's an inbred father ( dwight spurgin ) and his two inbred children ( mark kettler and jennifer poirrier-wallace ) that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog-half human mix with a shotgun , and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds .  why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of "" rednecks "" when you yourself had all of these cool powers ?  and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ?  i can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment .  the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence .  the character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated .  a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken .  he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever .  when she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her .  the presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her .  when it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ .  the box for the film claims "" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 .  contains nudity and graphic violence "" .  while both is certainly true , there doesn't seem to be much of either in any large amounts .  besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi-graphic self-surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety .  as for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident .  ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b-movie . com .  it has been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent .  besides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b-movie . com ) , a making-of video is also available called on thin ice .  i haven't had the opportunity to see the documentary , but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed , if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest ) , conducted the atmosphere on set .

0|an 80-year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch , wearing tight-fitting leather , as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a `pump-bitch' .  two men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them .  and roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch .  welcome to `ready to rumble' .  judging from the fact that potty-mouth adam sandler is the reigning box-office comedy champion , you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that yes , there is an audience for this sort of thing .  ladies and gentlemen , i weep for society .  mind you , when executed with style and comic ingenuity , jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel ( `there's something about mary' ) and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea ( `dumb and dumber' ) can be extremely funny .  unfortunately , `ready to rumble' is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers , nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired .  `ready to rumble' is built around the dedicated fan-base of professional wrestling . . . .  which , in fact , sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy .  but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves , and limited to a stampede of asinine , humdrum bathroom humor , basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and `bio dome' .  gordie boggs ( david arquette ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics .  by day , they transport raw sewage .  by night ( particularly on ? nitro' monday ) , they pay homage to their personal hero and savior - jimmy king ( oliver platt ) , the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community .  with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance , gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title first-hand .  but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair ( joe pantoliano , sporting long hair and cowboy boots ) has other plans .  sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page ( playing himself ) pummel the king into the tarp , thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans .  gordie and sean are shocked , rioting madly while arguing `this isn't even a pay-per view event ! ! '  they take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt .  along the way , you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well .  you may find something to like in `ready to rumble' if a ) you are a rasslin' aficionado yourself , or b ) you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of low-brow comedies .  i welcome low-brow humor with open arms - that is , if its fresh and resourceful .  `rumble' is nothing but a sloppy , frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation .  the first half-hour is the ultimate test of patience .  luckily , the simple-minded events pick up steam , particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling action .  director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in `varsity blues' , and when in the ring , he does professional work .  but the violence is too excessive .  having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen hart's tragic accident just last year , especially with one character's dive during a cage match .  this is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of .  outside the wrestling action , the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term ? scattershot' , while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10 , with brill's extensive vocabulary ranging from `diddly' to `boob' and so on .  the final tally : i chuckled a few times , groaned a lot , and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105 .  casting-wise , `ready to rumble' is an odd duck .  oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure ?  he's perhaps a bit chunky , but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty' , which dampens the blow i suppose .  rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader ( `the nirto-est of the nitro girls , ' proclaims gordie ) , but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg , `macho man' randy savage and sting ( among others ) .  wcw fans are sure to appreciate these .  others . . .  well , won't .  i found merit in david arquette's bountiful energy as gordie , which brings me to my finishing . . . .  ahhh . . . .  `praise' for the film : in `ready to rumble' , i have discovered something even more annoying than arquette's `at&t' television commercials .  now there's a low blow for you .  |-0.6666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|"The text expresses a negative sentiment towards the movie ""Ready to Rumble"" due to its vulgar language, crude humor, negative portrayal of society, lack of cleverness, and disappointing quality, further emphasized by the negative criticism and mention of potty-mouth Adam Sandler as the reigning box-office comedy champion."

0|" "" flubber "" is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation , and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney .  it's the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids , but anyone else will feel left out as it's boring , slow , and incredibly lifeless .  what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water , and it's a shame because it could have been a great film .  hypothetically , i mean .   "" flubber , "" as you probably know , is a remake of the disney classic i never saw , "" the absent minded professor , "" where a , well , absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as "" flubber , "" you know , flying rubber ?  the new one keeps the basic plot , but appears to have added a lot else , like more absent-mindedness on the part of the proffessor , some more villains , and several "" show-stopping "" moments , like a big rumba with the flubber , and some more elaborate setups , none which really make it any better , but instead make it worse .  the basic plot revolves around a college professor , philip brainerd ( robin williams ) , who creates lots and lots of inventions , but is sadly absent minded .  in fact , he's forgotten his wedding to the college's president , sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden ) , two times before he forgets it again at the beginning .  doesn't this warrant some kind of mental treatment ?  anyway , on his wedding day ( the third one ) , he invents the flubber , which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed , but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in "" the abyss . ""  philip believes that this invention , once fully realized , will save his college , which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon/villain , chester hoenicker ( raymond j . barry ) , which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to .  through a plot twist , hoenicker's goons , named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check ) , discover it the hard way , and try to steal for hoenicker , who wants it just 'cause he's evil enough .  a sub-plot involves philip's attempts to win back sara , who's angry at him ( and with good reason ) , but who is being seduced by who is basically philip's belloq , wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald , playing the hysterically suave-yet-unsuave asswhole once again ) .  and in another subplot , philip's day-timer robot , weebo ( voiced by the one-and-only jodi benson ) , falls in love with him .  yuckity-yuck .  what's most pathetic about this film is how dull it is .  you don't need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film , which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney , who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry , half-assedly re-mixing classics ( or non-classics ) for distribution to the general public , who sadly eats it all up .  earlier in '97 , they released "" jungle 2 jungle , "" an adaptation of a really awful french film , "" un indien dans la ville , "" which , yeah , improved over the original , but not by much .  disney's in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now , only creatively .  in the rush to ship out a film for distribution , disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called "" magic . ""  such scenes as dancing flubber , a flying car , a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber , and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze , delight , or even cause people to laugh .  i sat there the entire film stone faced , chuckling perhaps twice , and shaking my head at all the bad jokes .  who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ?  didn't think so .  it doesn't help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable .  philip is not a lovable absent minded professory , just a really dumb man being played by robin williams .  williams is a brilliant comic actor . . . okay , a brilliant actor in general , but here he's given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something , and other times act sad .  those times , he's not bad .  but what are we supposed to think of a man who's forgotten his wedding thrice ?  maybe it was funny and/or respectable in the 60s . . .  i like disney , and i usually enjoy their films , not only animated but live action , and their recent films ( save for "" hercules , "" which was good , but not great ) have been worse than lackluster , they've been pathetic .   "" jungle 2 jungle "" is probably the worst film i saw last year .   "" flubber "" 's probably second .  what do they need to do ?  perhaps create something new .  get writers who can write something that's universally entertaining .  films like "" the parent trap "" and "" mary poppins "" are films that are live action ( or in the latter case a mix of both ) , but even i can still watch them because they're not only written to be magical to children , but to be fun to adults .  what's more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn ?  and my god , couldn't they have done something else with edie mcclurg ?

0|"by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered .  after all , writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines .  the first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction .  as olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects .  lane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination .  all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other's protagonist .  but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse .  lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years .  he's not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they've got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise .  two months earlier , lacrosse's own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere .  lacrosse knows his killer's work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game .  it wouldn't be fair to reduce everything that's wrong with switchback to quaid's presence , but it's a pretty good place to start .  there's a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation .  we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he's grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp .  a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film .  quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated .  it's tough to become emotionally invested in a character's turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes .  even without quaid , it doesn't appear that switchback would have stayed on course .  the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat .  unfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal .  once the mystery of the killer's identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable .  in fact , "" stale and predictable "" describes the direction that switchback takes in general , falling back on far-too-common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and edgy law enforcement agents .  it's too bad stuart wasn't willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film .  played with atypical restraint by r . lee ermey , he's a wonderful , unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions .  a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling .  instead , stuart places his trust in a "" name "" star who can't carry the material .  maybe next time he'll throw away that one crucial page in the script , the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story .

0|"gregg araki's the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made .  so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus ?  first of all , some of the reviews were fairly positive .  also , the cast , consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars ( including christopher knight , eve plumb , shannen doherty , and david leisure ) was promising .  last of all , i wanted to give arraki one more chance .  i mean , the guy can't be that untalented , can he ?  the answer to that question is three letters long .  nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles .  since arraki doesn't know how to make anything coherent , it's hard to describe the plot .  let's just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend won't make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls .  the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star .  he turns out to be a nice guy who doesn't care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans .  this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming .  it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki , and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez .  i thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft .  he works better with the camera this time around , especially in the early scenes .  halfway through the film , i didn't necessarily find myself enjoying the film , but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation .  then as the movie went on , arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads , twisted sex games , and alien abductions .  it's sad , because he almost actually had some decent material here , but he ruined it with his usual in your face "" i'm such a renegade maverick filmmaker , look what i can do "" attitude .  the performances are generally better than in the doom generation , which isn't saying much .  at least we don't have to suffer jonathan "" i am the most hideous man in america "" schaech .  we are , however treated to another round of james "" i'm more wooden than keanu "" duval .  sarah lassez gives the best performance in the film , and kathleen robertson ( formerly of 90210 and now arraki's wife ) and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess .  of the tv star cameos , john ritter is the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist .  if i prefer nowhere to the doom generation , it is only in the way that i would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture .  maybe greg arraki doesn't want you to like his characters .  maybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them .  maybe he just wanted to piss me off .  if so , he was successful .

0|"sometimes , when i decide to write a short story or a poem , i think of a title first , and then think of a subject to go with it .  it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence .  i wouldn't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits , and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it .  the title sequence is so good , so ominous and original , that it had me engrossed before the picture even began .  of course , my attention dwindled shortly into the film .  disturbing behavior , like so many thrillers , starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous .  it's a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex .  it's a suspense film with no suspense .  it's an evil small town story with no story to speak of .  it's a disaster , a listless and uninspired disaster , that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences , a mercifully short running time , and one terrific set of opening credits .  our main man is a fellow named steve clark , blandly played by jimmy marsden .  he moves to a small town with his family after , tragically , his brother shoots himself .  steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally .  the big trial for steve is , of course , to fit in at school and make new friends .  marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail , so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject .  as a social reject , he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers , gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes ) .  gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks , known as the blue ribboners , are actually a bunch of zombies , assimilating new members into their group , while sporadically killing innocent people .  so , it's up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery , and 2 ) do something about it .  by the end of it all , something has happened and things have been explained , but the film still doesn't make any sense .  disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg .  i've seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script ) , and i imagine that , for the most part , he knows what he's doing when it comes to screenwriting .  he did , however , have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film , and then decided to actually take the time to write it out .  evil small town films are pretty common ( the last one , phantoms , is also a dismal failure ) , but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work .  rosenberg's script is a complete mess , lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization .  and it makes no sense , nor is their any purpose when things are finally "" explained . ""  there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks , but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening .  they get strapped to chairs , a microchip is inserted into their eyes , and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed , superviolent , machine-like creatures .  the doctor responsible for all this , dr . caldicott ( bruce greenwood ) , must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or , perhaps , this is the only realistic element in the film ) .  much of the writing is simply bad , and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act .  in one terrible scene , gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques , while pointing them out in the cafeteria .  up front , i should say that , in four years of high school , i did not eat in the cafeteria even once .  that aside , the various social groups he points out are general , uninteresting , and poorly-shown .  for instance , he points to the "" nerds , "" who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops .  it's such an obvious cliche that i can't believe rosenberg even bothered .  most of the dialogue is forced ( no one says , "" bite me ! ""  anymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit .  this picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy .  the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry .  horror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid .  there are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) .  i also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler .  he has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking .  the acting is largely a waste of talent .  marsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) .  bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted .  stahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction isn't good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahl's performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) .  none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn't all that cool .  disturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began .  i'm surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office .  it's not boring , or even blatantly awful , but it's an uninspired lump of a film .  it sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable .  so , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends .

""  - ernie hudson , as a police officer commenting on a suspicious death .  comic book translations are notorious tricky-- anyone up for a double-bill of the punisher and captain america ? -- and the crow proves no exception .  despite a gross of good intentions , brandon lee's final film doesn't fly very high .  the story opens on halloween eve , better known as devil's night .  wilmington-as-detroit is in flames and the police are tending to at least * one * murder : young rock-musician-turned-pavement-artist eric draven ( lee ) , found on a sidewalk six-stories below the apartment he was thrown from .  the cops are also upstairs , administering aid to his fiance who was assaulted and raped and not necessarily in that order .  she dies , the perps .  escape , and , exactly one year later , draven rises from the grave to wreak revenge .  sound familiar ?  unlike charles bronson , whose only known superpower involves an inability to refrain from filming death wish sequels , lee's character has supernatural strength and amazing agility and can even reheal from gunshot wounds faster than robert patrick in terminator 2 . by his side is his crow , the presumable source of his powers as related in the narration .  wearing what appears to be alice cooper's leftover make-up , lee is plopped into an underlit urban landscape that was obviously modeled after batman and blade runner .  but no number of red-lit , rain-soaked streets can compensate for cheap fx that make the crow seem closer to darkman than batman .   ( the glaring miniatures should show better on video , though .   : )  a nod to darkman is an insult to sam raimi , though , because alex proyas can't film a decent action scene to save his life .  his two "" best "" set-pieces-- some banzai board-room butchery and a cool church- roof sword fight-- are also undercut by the awful editing of dov hoenig and scott smith .  blame said editors for the film's frightful flashbacks , as well .  but the pace is quick , thank god , and every good-idea-turned-bad is over before it begins .  the cast is better than it should be .  ernie hudson is a good choice as a friendly policeman and he gets off most of the film's funnier lines .  newcomer rochelle davis does well as both the narrator and draven's scrappy ward .  jon polito has a small , succulent role as pungent pawnbroker .  and michael wincott makes a distinct impression as a long-haired mr . big whose collection of ancient-swords makes him seem like he walked into the film from the trailer to highlander iii .  there can be only one .  finally , there's brandon lee , son of bruce lee , and a 28-year-old rising-star who was fatally shot during shooting .  lee had four films to his name-- kung fu : the movie , laser mission , showdown in little toyko , and rapid fire-- and the crow would've been a nice feather in his belt and that's about it .  there's nothing great from him here-- just a good performance that owes as much to presence as ability .  when the echo of that gunshot finally fades , watching the crow should prove an even * less * remarkable experience .  despite a healthy dose of humor and some surprising sincerity , the crow is still just a couple notches above its straight-to-video brethren .  for now , maybe it's an appropriate eulogy to an actor who could only get better .

""  i am only vaguely aware of the show's premise , and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube .   "" party of five , "" i do know however , seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre .  neve campbell , scream queen of the 90s and star of scream , scream 2 , and the craft , is a regular of the show .  so too is jennifer love hewitt .  lo and behold , following in the footsteps of campbell , hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line .  though the original film , released last year , was watchable enough , this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout .  jennifer love hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however , unlike neve campbell , hewitt struggles with acting .  she just isn't convincing in this film ( and she wasn't in the original either ) .  this puts many young males , including myself , in a paradoxical quandary : she's very attractive , but the annoying , spoiled , valley girl-type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize , exploitatively , her figure .  add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy , another rising teen tv star , and you get one frustrated male audience .  i've spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason .  i still know what you did last summer , though cashing in on the success of the original , ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses .  nothing else here is original or interesting .  this movie , in fact , makes other recent so-so horror films like urban legend and john carpenter's vampires seem like stunning works of high art .  i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location , a storm , parentless teenagers , false alarm nightmares , lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes , a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him , knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere , etc . you get the picture .  the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killer's hook .  they may as well have huge targets painted on them .  like scream and its numerous knockoffs , these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief .  unfortunately , i still know's characters aren't all that funny .  in particular , one character , a chain-weed-smoking guy , is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesn't die soon enough .  the death scenes , by the way , are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film .  several of them are uncomfortable to watch , and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser : bloodline , a truly sadistic movie .  this , too , did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for .  and what is the deal with the slasher himself ?  i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre , but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror .  come on , the guy looks like the gorton's fisherman , and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate .  though his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater , his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film , and that's * really * saying something .  so , all that's left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy .  both prance about in tightfitting , revealing outfits or in various states of undress , yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene .  hewitt , however , does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite .   .   . titillating .  this scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system .  otherwise , hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves .  early in the film , for instance , brandy wins the trip to the bahamas .  she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever .  i needed extra-strength tylenol after that part .  oh , and the film's conclusion , talk about repetitive !  people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still know's ending at least 5 minutes before it happens .  boring !  i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater .  admission is only one dollar on wednesdays , and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them .  it's usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience , who don't seem to mind participating in a mass "" mystery science theater 3000 "" -type viewing .  i still know what you did last summer , however , produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience , underscoring how bad it * really * is .  if it weren't for the main actresses' revealing wardrobes , i'd have had a very , very hard time sitting through this lame sequel .  i can't imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldn't recommend it to people , unless they're horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy .  i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works .  what a depressing thought .  hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act .  rated r , this film contains lots of violence , several gory scenes , and a couple nubile , horny teenagers--though the sex act itself is always thwarted .  i'd say this is unsuitable for kids , but teens wouldn't have a problem sitting through it , especially since they obviously compose the film's target audience .

0|note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  to assess alex cox's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent .  it would be derisive .  it would be glib .  it would be dismissive .  it would be entirely accurate .  rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging .  the film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous .  the film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d'onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables .  despite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities .  consequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent .  louise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip's life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip's estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise's ex-beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene .   ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father's corpse , sans one hand . )  meanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low-rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy's gift with the dice .  serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese's casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casino's operations - he * is * the eye in the sky .  it could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not the case in the winner , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate , and the would-be swindlers of philip's fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest .  it is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr . d'onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr . lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr . madsen , ms . demornay , and mr . whaley have all done good work in the past .  none of the actors in the winner are in top form here , and this film won't likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes .  director alex cox does what he can with wendy riss' screenplay , and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play ; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one .  while tedious , the film is well-paced and does not meander , but it would be near-impossible task for mr . cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film's widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization .  to his credit , my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies .  i caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened .  to be honest , though , i couldn't begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it - i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question .  the winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing .  the film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain , but i am honestly not being facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which i was munching .  |-0.8833333333333333|0.8833333333333333|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is highly negative, with the film ""The Winner"" being described as excruciatingly annoying, tedious, unfunny, unengaging, and having widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization.

0|"what's to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography--ie .  the garbage known as "" snuff "" films ?  nothing , right ?  what's to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ?  well . . . nothing .  so , why make it , hollywood ?  there's no reason why the average , sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic .  no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this .  the lack of quality filmmaking in "" 8mm "" ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star , writer , and supporting cast--all reputable .  but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again !  like paul schrader , schumacher has his moments , but they're few and far ( far ! )  between .  basically , this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it .  why not walk out ?  well , this wouldn't be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie .  here's why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of "" 8mm "" . . .  first thing--if you don't heed my advice , then understand what you're about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud .  it's not easy to watch .  i didn't know the details of the story beforehand , but at least my ignorance can help others now .  the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator .  a rich old woman discovers a "" snuff "" film in her late husband's safe .  she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl , didn't it , schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead .  she's horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm , of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find .  family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque "" murder "" .  let me backtrack for a moment .  see , "" snuff "" films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead .  however , the deaths are often staged and , in those cases , special effects and "" good "" acting make all the difference .  very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies .  the thought of this "" industry "" makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review , but i'll swallow my bile and move on .  welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry .  you'd think he's sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him !  he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze .  after a lot of digging and bribing , welles finds the men who are responsible for making this , and other , "" snuff "" films .  skip ahead , skip ahead , skip ahead . . .  led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer "" machine "" ( christopher bauer ) , they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue .  the movie doesn't end there , unfortunately , because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante .  this film doesn't draw you in .  it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ?  it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie .   "" se7en "" ) , but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) .  by those jabs , i'm not only referring to his stylish destruction of the "" batman "" franchise , but "" a time to kill "" was an immensely overrated disappointment .  for a guy who gets so much studio money , his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled .  a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter .  writer andrew kevin walker didn't recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for '95s twisted thriller , "" se7en "" .  director schumacher doesn't have that innate ability to make you watch things you don't really want to see like better directors are capable of doing .  he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we don't see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when it's a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered ) .  however , gratuitous is joel's middle name .  he must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint .  no , he doesn't go that far , but we see enough unpleasantness .  he doesn't leave much to the imagination .  it's manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante .  the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters , yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! )  craft .  case in point , a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good , right ? )  drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad , right ? ) .  see . . . no  subtlety .  does joel think we're stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ?  who do we root for in this mess ?  is there anybody out there ?  it's not all the director's fault , though .  why did the actors sign up for this ?  nicolas cage is an oscar-winner , for cryin' out loud !  if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money , what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ?  what is cage supposed to be in this movie--a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ?  villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy .  and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ?  he was so solid as a concerned father in "" a civil action "" .  i guess ol' nic , pete , and jim were promised a mountain of money . . . or  they're suckers .  or they just don't care .  there are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland .  catherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs . wells .  baby cindy is obviously cute and wells' devout love of his daughter is sweet .  the mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter .  this film has an appropriate blue-toned , washed-out look like "" payback "" ( which was a much better movie ) .  the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue , but at other times it's rough .  during some conversations , close-ups and wide shots are not cut very well , making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts aren't good and whose timing was a half-second off .  such a technical error indeed stands out .  speaking of standing out , don't believe the misleading trailers .  there's not much action here .  occasionally , yes , but not as often as your tv will have you believe .  after seeing "" 8mm "" , i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again .  is that a positive ?  well , if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive , they've done a swell job here .  it'll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance--unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved .  but today i'm not depraved , so i ask , why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ?  i'm sure that somewhere right now there's some pretty sick crap going on , but that doesn't mean i need to know about it .  yes , mr . walker , your script tells us that there are some screwed-up folks out there .  yes , mr . walker , the proverbial monster doesn't look like we expect him to .  you said all that in 1995 .  move on .  this film serves no purpose .  it doesn't entertain , it doesn't teach us anything , it doesn't make a statement beyond the obvious "" this stuff is bad "" approach .  only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile .  that's not likely to happen , though , so "" 8mm "" is indeed a scummy waste of money .  orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film , "" to movies . . . to  good movies "" .  if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole .  like "" snuff "" films , "" 8mm "" should never have been made .  now , excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it .  useless trivia--joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme .  he used it in "" batman forever "" , in "" batman & robin "" , in "" a time to kill "" , in "" falling down "" , and it's rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow . . .

0|"in the james bond film "" diamonds are forever , "" tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads .  bond's response is that it doesn't really matter , as long as collars and cuffs match .  well , collars and cuffs don't match in "" the real blonde . ""  what might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny , meandering comedy on screen .  the film , supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business , is wafer thin .  it plays like an "" ally mcbeal "" episode dragged out to the nth degree , replete with a few unnecessary "" fantasy "" sequences .  writer/director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea .  it isn't .  the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary .  matthew modine plays joe , a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent .  he's 35 with no agent and no credits since he's too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas .   "" that's not really acting "" he tells his girlfriend of six years , mary ( catherine keener ) , with whom he bickers constantly about sex .  but they need the money , so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video .  but it's not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike ( played by elizabeth berkley , still trying to jump-start her career after "" showgirls "" ) .  this points out how artificial this whole business is , one supposes .  dicillo has referred to "" the real blonde "" as "" off-kilter , but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff . . . ""  the film , which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere , is remarkably * on * -kilter and , with perhaps the single exception of the always-likable modine ( who's not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks ) , the entire cast is vague and uninteresting .  catherine keener , who's appeared in dicillo's previous three films ( including the brilliant "" living in oblivion "" ) , is at her most annoying in "" the real blonde . ""  look at her closely ; she really can't act at all .  her reactions are all wrong , almost always out of sync with her co-stars .  she reacts too soon , or too late , to lines and situations .  she moves her eyes , or her mouth , far too much .  she frowns , she yells , she babbles--she blows chunks .  maxwell caulfield plays joe's actor/waiter buddy bob , the one obsessed with dating a "" natural "" blonde .  bob's personality ( not to mention caulfield's acting ability ) parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera "" passion crest "" --stiff and uninteresting .  maybe that's the point .  daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title , a soap dish who beds bob both on- and off-camera .  hannah looks about fifty in this movie ( she's only 37 ) .  why is that ?  almost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples .  why is that ! ?  marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer .  kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent .  buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink .  christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer .  and so on .  the best parts of the "" the real blonde "" are the beginning and the end , brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog .  there's more depth and sincerity in a single close-up of her expressive face than in the entire film .  while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters' lives , the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if it's funny .
