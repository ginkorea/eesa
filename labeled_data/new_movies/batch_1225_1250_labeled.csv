0|"plot : a rich guy who doesn't believe in love , orders a mail-order bride for himself .  that very evening , the couple is married and fall madly in love soon thereafter .  but what's this ?  one of them might not be the person they are pretending to be ?  wow . . . a  sin , indeed .  critique : easily one of the worst movies that i've seen all year .  too long , too boring , too predictable and too ridiculous for anyone interested in watching a good movie .  what the hell were they thinking when they made this thing ?   ( it's no wonder that the film has been sitting on the racks for about a year ) this felt like a really bad tv movie of the week , with some nudity stuffed in from time to time , just to wake up the audience .  have you ever switched channels and fallen upon one of those ridiculously melodramatic tv movies , one that you just couldn't help but switch back to from time to time , just to make sure that it wasn't part of some sick joke ?  well , this movie is exactly like that , only it isn't a joke , it isn't on tv and you are asked to pay money to see it ! !  i say again . . . what the shite were they thinking ?  okay , so where do i start ?  first of all , the trailer of this film gives away the movie's main plot twist , the betrayal .  so for the first half hour of the film , you're basically just sitting there , watching these two "" lovers "" go through the motions until the "" betrayal "" occurs .  whoopee , big surprise .  second of all , angelina jolie is horribly miscast in this part .  why ?  well , it's like this : not for one second do you ever believe that she is not a nasty backstabbing woman !  i mean , it's like all of those people who complained about jack nicholson being psycho from the start of the shining , well , the same goes here .  every look in jolie's eyes screams "" psycho "" !  then of course , you have the case of the "" patsy "" husband , a man who just can't seem to figure out anything in time .  i mean . . . how  boring is that for the audience ?  you're watching this guy screw up time after time after time , and somehow , we're supposed to feel sorry or care about this dude .  no , thanks !  and if we don't care about him , and we really don't care about her ( she's a beeyatch and as confused as we are about her actual motivations in the film ) , who the hell are we supposed to care about in this film ?  well , i'll tell you .  the only thing that i was worrying about the whole way through this picture was whether or not i'd actually fall asleep before the end credits rolled .  no suspense , no chemistry between the leads , no real love or passion , no sense of surprise , plenty of plot holes for everyone and an extra moronic ending .  so why am i even giving this film a rating of three points ?  well , it's actually pretty simple .  i liked the locations in the movie and the groovy score , but my primary reason for slipping three notches onto this bedpost is for the gratuitous shots of jolie's boobies ( that's two points right there ! ) and another one for antonio's ass ( hairless , just for the record ) .  everything else in this movie was pointless , boring and just plain stupid .  try imagining a soft-porn movie . . . but  without the plot !  that's pretty much what you've got here .  a low point in the careers of both stars .  oops , i almost forgot to mention the crappy dialogue . . . god  oh mighty . . . make  it stop ! !  where's joblo coming from ?  american psycho ( 9/10 ) - cruel intentions ( 8/10 ) - eyes wide shut ( 6/10 ) - fatal attraction ( 8/10 ) - playing by heart ( 7/10 ) - under suspicion ( 7/10 ) - what lies beneath ( 8/10 ) - what women want ( 4/10 ) - whipped ( 7/10 )  "|-0.8166666666666668|0.9|0.9|The reviewers express strong disappointment and frustration with the movie, criticizing various aspects including the length, predictability, ridiculousness, miscasting of actors, lack of chemistry, suspense, real love, and poor dialogue.

0|"not a great twelve months for either of the principals from this movie .  earlier this year , nora ephron wrote and produced one of the year's least likeable "" comedies "" called hanging up , featuring a bunch of annoying women ( ironically , lisa kudrow played one in that film as well ) who barely have time to care about anyone but themselves .  ick . . . real  sweet stuff .  but her little unsuccessful project was nothing compared to what john travolta went through earlier this summer , with a film entitled battlefield earth .  i seemed to be the only person on this planet who somehow appreciated the film , even if it was on a "" cheese "" factor , as everybody , and i mean everybody else , pretty much classified the movie as one of the worst disasters of all time .  yipes . . . another  beauty .  so what happens when you put these two people in the same room and come out with a movie co-starring the ever-versatile lisa kudrow ?  uhhhm , you guessed it . . . not  much .  plot : in order to escape major financial difficulties , a local weatherman hooks up with his ball-picking lotto girlfriend and rigs the state lottery .  but as more and more people find out about their scheme , more and more people demand a part of their winnings , and more and more problems arise .  critique : simply stated , i didn't laugh once during this entire picture .  for a comedy , it offered me a few smiles , a bunch of nincompoops as characters , a miscast john travolta hamming it up and lisa kudrow , in what can only described as a "" sluttier "" version of her character of phoebe on tv's "" friends "" .  this film was not as disastrous as i thought it would be , but it was pretty close .  thankfully , the clips of travolta dressed up in goofy outfits , dancing as the weatherman were left in the film's trailer , and not in this final cut .  and not unlike the worst movie of the year so far , beautiful , this film also managed to feature many unsympathetic , idiotic and just plain irritating characters in its cast .  foremost was travolta's character , who declined to give us any reason to care for him once in the entire movie .  and for me , the casting choice of john travolta for this role was just plain wrong .  he didn't fit the part .  i just saw him in get shorty the other day and thought about how perfect he was for that role .  a cool , calculating roughneck with a certain hip , suave "" je ne sais quoi "" .  in this film , he looks like he's trying to be funny , trying to be bad , trying to be good .  we're not supposed to be able to notice that , and when we do , at least in my case , i consider it a wrong choice in casting .  add that to lisa kudrow , boring us with yet another one of her patented "" dumb blonde "" routines , but this time , dressed in sexier outfits .  michael rapaport , stretching one small acting muscle to play the guy who isn't quite up at the same speed level as everyone else .  and a truckload of empty comedic bullet shells , and you've got yourself an extremely quiet audience anticipating punch lines that never quite materialize .  the only real good thing that i could say about this film is that its story was actually half-interesting and never really bored me .  i also liked michael moore's perverted cousin character , and i loved , and i say it again , loved the character that bill pullman played .  give this dude his own movie !  he played a lazy cop , a man who tries everything not to do any real work .  he fakes injuries to get off duty , tries to avoid arrest situations so that he won't have to fill out any forms . . . now  there's a base of humor .  sadly , the filmmakers decided to bring him into play with only about half an hour left in the film .  and there's not much else i can say about this movie , folks .  on the whole , it was lame , included a slew of unlikable characters fiddling around in a pool of unfunny lines , and very little of interest for any target audience .  but get somebody to write up a movie featuring that lazy cop played by pullman and i'm there !

0|"first and foremost i think this movie comes to grief at the hands of the pg rating it's been given .  for those of us who haven't read the james lee burke novel that heaven's prisoners is based on , do not rabidly go out and buy tickets to movies featuring the combined talents of alec baldwin and eric roberts , feel vaguely depressed by the notion of swamps , gangsters with louisiana accents , plots , sub-plots , more plots , and well , really just want to see teri hatcher naked , this is one movie you're going to worry the price of admission over .  hopeful still ?  well , let me share my moment of sheer panic , and then the cold enervation of the big let-down when a semi-robed hatcher purrs to alec baldwin , "" what do you think of my butterfly ?

0|"it's amazing how a comedian can have the some of the funniest stand-up around but completely fall flat in the movies .  take adam sandler .  on the basis of his first two cds ( "" they're all gonna laugh at you ! ""  and "" what the hell happened to me ? "" ) ,  he's the best thing to hit comedy since robin williams .  but when you put him in front of a camera , it just isn't the same .  i kind of enjoyed happy gilmore and thought that it warranted a marginal recommendation , but his latest film , the waterboy is about as funny as a root canal .  seriously , i'm willing to wager than there were more laughs in saving private ryan than there are here .  in fact , i found this movie to be more depressing than comedic .  the first half hour generated not one smile in me , with it's scenes of emotional abuse towards adam's character of bobby boucher not only by the cruel football players , but also by his very disturbed mother ( kathy bates - what is the world coming to ? ) .  granted , after the film gets rolling , there are a few mild chuckles throughout ( i'm even willing to admit that it actually had me laughing once or twice ) , but not nearly enough to sustain the waterboy for it's nearly hour and a half running time .  you're all familiar with the plot because you've seen it at least a million times before ; everyone picks on the hero until he shows a hidden talent and leads the underdog team to victory over the champions , in the process not only winning the respect of his teammates but also getting the woman he loves .  and believe me , i'm not giving anything away by saying that sandler's team wins .  if you would actually feel any degree of suspense watching this movie , then god be with you .  the only things that keep this bomb from getting the big banana are the winning performances from henry winkler as the insecure coach and the severely underrated fairuza balk as bobby's love interest .  i mean , they should be lending their talents to some loftier purpose , but they do extremely well with what they are given here .  kudos to both of them .  my advice to adam is to try and follow in the footsteps of veteran comedians like williams and steve martin , who made a very smooth and successful transition from stage to screen .  rely more on actual comedy rather than strange voices and rude noises to make people laugh .  or maybe even show what dramatic talent he might have , like jim carrey did with the recent truman show .  with the obvious and considerable talent that he possesses , he just can't keep going on like this .

0|"according to popular film opinion , a film's greatness is determined by time .  take for example "" casablanca .

0|"by trying to satisfy every kind of viewer , it's possible that sphere may end up pleasing no one .  action lovers will be bored by what they will see as an interminably boring setup .  audience members who crave more intellectual fare will be disgusted by the film's sudden collapse into mindless storytelling and by the ending , which is an insulting cop-out .  somewhere out there , maybe there's a small cadre of film-goers who will appreciate sphere's dubious charms , but i'm not among them .  i sincerely hope the novel is better than the movie ( i no longer read anything by either michael crichton or john grisham ) , because if the finished motion picture product is anything to go by , it's hard to understand why the rights were optioned .  sphere is the kind of first- class mess that only a top-line director with an a-list cast can create .  with expectations high ( and how could they not be , considering that another barry levinson/dustin hoffman collaboration , the excellent wag the dog , is still playing in theaters ? ) ,  something this bad can't help but look even worse .  the last time a big-name , big-budget film displayed this level of ineptitude was last year's batman & robin , and everyone knows how that movie was received .  sphere starts out a little like an amalgamation of contact and james cameron's the abyss , but , somewhere along the way , it collapses into the cellar with another recent science fiction effort , event horizon .  science and philosophy , which are used to good effect during sphere's first hour , give way to mindless , confusing action sequences .  attempts at characterization fall apart .  intelligent writing , which is evident early on , is replaced by hackneyed drivel .  special effects take over as the plotline devolves into incoherent silliness .  but all that is just in preparation for the ending , which is inexcusably awful .  this is the time-honored deus ex machina device used to its worst effect .  i left the theater feeling cheated by the way crichton and his screenwriters had chosen to end the film .  there is some promise , but it's all in the setup .  we're introduced to norman goodman ( dustin hoffman ) , a psychologist who once wrote a $35 , 000 report for the government about what to do in the event that a crashed space ship is discovered .  when one is found in the middle of nowhere , 1000 feet below the surface of the pacific ocean , norman is called in to be part of the welcoming committee .  on the team with him are beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , a biochemist who was once his student and lover ; harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , a mathematician who earned his first doctorate at the age of 18 ; ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) , an astrophysicist who is awed by the opportunity to explore alien technology ; and harold barnes ( peter coyote ) , the government operative in charge of the mission .  together , the five descend into the bowels of the ocean , where they rendezvous with a temporary sea base on the ocean floor from which they will attempt to make first contact .  for a while , sphere had me fooled into thinking it was going to take an astute approach to the man-meets-alien situation .  the overall scenario is not without promise and several plot twists ( such as the revelation that the enormous craft is actually an american space ship , apparently from the future ) offer intriguing possibilities .  then , right around the one-hour mark ( that's the time to sneak into the theater next door and check out whatever's left of titanic ) , the virtually non-stop action begins , and , once it starts , the script becomes superfluous .  this might be acceptable if director levinson generated some legitimate tension , but , instead , he relies on loud , overbearing music , strange camera angles , and quick cuts to make things "" exciting . ""  additionally , because none of the characters are well-formed ( a common failing in anything penned by crichton , who's more interested in technology than people ) , viewers don't develop much of a rooting interest .  it makes sitting through sphere a frustrating and pointless experience .  what about that a-list cast ?  not surprisingly , the most energetic performance is given by samuel l . jackson , but his harry isn't a person ; he's a walking plot device spouting occasionally-witty dialogue .  dustin hoffman isn't lively or particularly good -- it's ironic that this , which may be his worst work in a decade , has arrived in theaters on the heels of his best actor nomination ( for wag the dog ) .  sharon stone and peter coyote are both flat .  their characters exhibit little evidence of emotion ; automatons would have been as effective .  then there's queen latifa , who , despite getting fifth billing in the credits ( ahead of liev schreiber , who boasts at least quadruple her screen time ) , has less than a handful of lines and almost nothing to do other than inflate the body count .  i like to think that levinson and hoffman , recognizing how uninspired this movie was likely to be , chose to make wag the dog as a sort of penance ( the low-budget picture was filmed during sphere's lengthy pre-production phase ) .  if that's the case , forgiveness is granted .  i'm less inclined to look favorably upon crichton , although he has a few enjoyable titles on his resume ( jurassic park and the levinson-directed disclosure come to mind ) .  even if his novel was butchered in the adaptation process , crichton's credit as a producer disallows him absolution .  he was a willing participant in a creative travesty .  no wonder sphere is being released in february , in the midst of the early year's cinematic wasteland .  it deserves no better than to get sunk by the unstoppable titanic , which should plow sphere under on its way to a ninth-consecutive weekend atop the box office heap .

""  through a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts .  so , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production .  however , the young writer has a severe case of writer's block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well .  he has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate's daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can't seem to put words to paper .  then , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer's block .  there are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing .  the first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it's author .  ironically , that couldn't be truer here .  the great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors .  one of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love .  so it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character's name in the credits .  the acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth's theatres .  joseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though .  he is tragically unbelievable and comically bad .  gwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well .  however , the supporting cast does almost save the day .  geoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking .  they both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links .  you will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn't qualify as real acting . ) .  and rupert everett was cute in his small part as well .  but not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances .  when all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained .  however , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn't necessarily quality .  and this certainly isn't quality .  perhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work .  simply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining .

0|"five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king's writings called the shawshank redemption ( 9/10 ) , writer/director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king .  unlike the latter film , this one is a big , long , laborious bore .  plot : a seven-foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers .  critique : this film is slow , drawn-out , boring , uninteresting , unexciting , predictable and topped with a couple of one-dimensional "" evil "" characters .  its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles .  the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward , unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about .  of course , much like all other death row cell blocks , this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be "" misunderstood "" , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guy who is evil personified .  and let's not forget all the guards on death row , who also happen to be angels from the heaven above , except for one cookie-cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified ( and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates ? ? ? ) .  am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film ?  or even more importantly , am i supposed to give a rat's ass about anyone in this film ?  well , if i was , i sure missed that boat , because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin .  furthermore , there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone's life to present this story .  in fact , the story is empty within itself .  i truly did not get anything out of the film other than the fact that there is a guy on death row who has special powers to heal , and we are left wondering if he should still be executed or not .  wow .  how interesting .  the plot's utter predictability is also at fault here with one guess as to whom is to get healed by the gentle monster in this film ( we are told that one certain lady has a tumor early on in the movie ) .  whip out those thinking caps , kids !  hmmm , and i wonder what will happen to those two cookie-cutter "" evil "" guys who have nothing in their system but hate and negativity .  hmmmm , now think hard here , boys and girls .  what a crock !  i am guessing that this film was supposed to be some three-hour exercise in spirituality , but unfortunately for me , it was neither spiritual or the least bit engaging .  in fact , it was one big bore .  i didn't see the point of the movie , i didn't see the point of the story and i certainly didn't see the point in tom hanks' big double-chin .  all in all , a bad movie starring some great actors doing solid work , especially michael clarke duncan as the man of the hour , john coffey .  give that man an award or something !

0|"synopsis : a small town thug convinces a dimwitted high-school student to spy on his girlfriend , who is babysitting three unruly kids for their alcoholic parents on a friday night .  while this is going on , the thug , the father , the boyfriend , and a kid reaching the onset of puberty all have fantasies about the babysitter .  comments : to say this movie is bad would be quite an understatement .  i'm not sure what writer and director ferland was hoping to accomplish with the babysitter .  suspense ?  family drama ?  humor ?  erotica ?  elements of each of these genres exist in the film , yet it fails to successfully achieve any of them .  instead , the babysitter is a dull , lifeless movie which manages to bore and ultimately irritate its viewers .  i suppose this film could have been watchable if it weren't for the fact that the characters are universally unappealing .  alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer , the babysitter .  her character has absolutely no depth at all , and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters' fantasies .  everyone else in the film seems to be in a competition to see who can stoop to the lowest level by the time the film ends .  the parents are alcoholics who become increasingly obnoxious as the movie proceeds .  the father ( played by j . t .  walsh ) fantasizes about the babysitter ; the mother fantasizes about her husband's best friend .  none of these fantasy sequences , trust me , are things that need to be seen , but we see them anyway , complete with cheesy , make-out saxophone music .  the thug , in the meantime , proves that he's evil through his annoying habit of smashing half-empty beer bottles all of a sudden and for no apparent reason .  the most absurd character , however , is the babysitter's boyfriend who seems catatonically brain-dead .  the thug , in a manipulative , iago-like manner ( though he doesn't really need to try hard ) , manages to talk the boyfriend into binge-drinking , smoking grass , running away from cops , and playing peeping tom on his own girlfriend in a matter of minutes .  incredible !   ( of course , the boyfriend's original plan for the evening was , try not to laugh , to sit in an empty diner and read catcher in the rye by j . d . salinger . )  if the goal of the babysitter was to be suspenseful , then it fails .  there are surprisingly few tense moments in this film , and nearly all of them come at the final minute .  by that time , however , the audience is so tired of the inane characters that no one truthfully cares what happens to any of them .  no suspense occurs in the dream sequences either because every single one of them is obviously a dream sequence from its inception .  if the goal of the babysitter was to be humorous , then it also fails .  i found nothing even remotely funny about the boozing parents who seemed , at times , to be played for laughs .  if the goal of the babysitter was to be dramatic , then , once again , it fails .  the characters are one-dimensional and uninteresting .  finally , if the goal of the babysitter was to be titillating ( the type of film destined to be played ad infinitum on hbo at 2 in the morning ) , then it fails as well .  the dream sequences aren't erotic ; they are too brief and , outside of one very short scene , contain no nudity .  i can't completely trash this movie .  the first 10 minutes or so vaguely resemble an interesting film , and the conclusion sports a halfway decent fistfight .  the other 79 minutes , though , are a drag .  silverstone's character , at the end of the movie , turns to her boyfriend and asks "" what were you thinking ? ""  i asked myself the same question , having spent 99 cents renting this turkey .

0|"working in the motion picture industry must be a constant source of frustration for a front-line african american actress like jada pinkett smith .  despite being one of the freshest talents available , pinkett smith has often been relegated to playing thankless supporting parts ( a low down dirty shame , the nutty professor ) .  the problem is , of course , that there aren't many good roles available for black women .  take away the likes of waiting to exhale , set it off , soul food , and eve's bayou , and all that's left is a chance to be someone's girlfriend , a local whore , or a murder victim .  as a result , for pinkett smith's first opportunity atop the marquee , she is stuck in a stupid , formulaic romantic comedy with the unpromising title of woo .  actually , woo , the latest directorial effort from daisy v . s .  mayer ( party girl ) , could have been worse than it is .  the film offers a few funny ( albeit juvenile ) moments and the on-screen relationship between pinkett smith's woo and tommy davidson's tim is appealing on those rare occasions when the two aren't forced to play it dumb for the sake of an endless barrage of cheap gags .  unfortunately , huge portions of the movie are insulting to the intelligence of anyone with a triple-digit i . q .  the situations are painfully contrived , the main characters are lifted right out of sit-coms , and the supporting players are so incredibly stupid that i wondered whether they all participated in some kind of "" free lobotomy "" lab experiment .  woo is a spontaneous , energetic young woman who has been looking for love in all the wrong places .  her latest relationship , with a testosterone-overdosed drug-dealer , came to an abrupt end when she refused to wear a beeper .  now , her transvestite/medium friend celestrial ( girlina ) predicts that she's about to meet mr . right , and that he'll be a virgo .  later that day , woo is given an opportunity to go out on a blind date with tim , a shy man with a penchant for neatness and order , who just happens to be a virgo .  it's not love at first sight , however .  things get off to a rocky start when tim makes an awkward pass , and they get even worse when the pair arrives at a swanky restaurant to enjoy a "" quiet "" dinner .  in the one-hundred year history of motion pictures , there have been a ton of bad "" white "" movies about mismatched lovers , so i suppose it's only fair that we get a "" black "" effort of the same low caliber .  as in all romantic comedies , we know from the beginning that woo and tim are going to end up together .  the question is , are their courtship rituals entertaining ?  in a good entry to the genre , the audience becomes caught up in the love story , no matter how familiar it is .  in woo , the constant reliance upon unfunny , moronic humor sinks the project .  for those who enjoy spotting continuity gaffes , there's a huge one in woo involving a corvette with a broken window that miraculously repairs itself ( added to that is the mystery of how the car looses its top ) .  sadly , that's one of the film's most enjoyable sequences , and the entertainment value is entirely unintentional .  despite exuding charm from every pore , there's little that pinkett smith and davidson can do to save their characters or david c . johnson's script .  since it misses the mark by so much , a better name for woo might have been whoops .

0|"there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been .  the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944 , where a one-time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets , fists stuffed into coat pockets .  to one side of him , residents scavenge for food in the street ; to the other side , german troops beat a group of jews .  jakob , however , never stops moving .  it's an efficient , effective set-up for the character , who is clearly nobody's idea of a hero at the outset .  he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them , excising his moral peripheral vision .  the set-up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior .  after a visit to a german commandant's office and a moment alone with a turned-on radio , jakob learns that russian troops are quite near .  when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews , they become convinced that he must have a radio , which is a punishable offense in the ghetto .  the good news brings hope to the ghetto ; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes .  a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive .  this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting : the "" ordinary person "" in question , jakob heym , is played by robin williams .  i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his "" serious "" roles with every passing year .  compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams , and see how much more mannered he has become ( or , at the very least , how much less sensible at choosing material ) .  jakob the liar depends on the notion that jakob has to struggle to craft his fictions , but williams always looks like he's struggling _not_ to craft them .  when he improvises a radio address by winston churchill for ailing 10-year-old orphan lina ( hannah taylor gordon ) , he seems relieved that he can finally get wacky .  oh yes , and then there's that little girl .  some viewers will undoubtedly consider the hero's fanciful stories for a young charge too reminiscent of life is beautiful , but those scenes aren't problematic because they're familiar .  they're problematic because they're jarring and distracting , introducing a cutesy relationship into a film that shouldn't have been about cutesy relationships .  jakob's character arc may be about his willingness to act for the benefit of others , but there are plenty of others without poor little lina .  every scene with her feels contrived , pulling jakob the liar away from its central story of hope coming to a previously hopeless people .  it is a pleasant surprise to find that jakob the liar is a much grittier production than you might expect from a hollywood-ized holocaust , combining the weighty subject matter with dark humor in some effective ways .  director peter kassovitz , working from jurek becker's novel , crafts some nice scenes between jakob and the other townspeople , and draws solid performances from armin mueller-stahl ( as a once-revered doctor ) and bob balaban ( as a barber drifting into depression ) .  there are just too many things going on that prove distracting , whether it's the sketchy romanctic angle involving liev schreiber as an earnest former prizefighter , or williams' incongrous presence , or a sweet but utterly irrelevant little girl .  jakob the liar deals with too delicate a subject for such fumbling , and has too compelling a central character to waste .  and after one wonderful early scene , you can see the film wasted and fumbled away .

0|" "" spice world "" is just one long promotional film for the british girl band the spice girls .  sure there's a hint of humor in there every once in a while .  actually , there's a couple of pretty good jabs at the spice girls .  but overall , who cares ?  not me .  if you don't know by now , the spice girls sing songs of love and friendship and responsibility and girl power , yet dress like streetwalkers from a lower middle class neighborhood .  in "" spice world "" they ride around in their big tour bus , whining about having to do photo shoots and give interviews .  amazingly , all the talk they do about keeping commitments and upholding responsibilities only really applies to fun things , things they want to do , not things they are required to do to keep earning money .  and they keep babbling about "" girl power "" when they should really be talking about "" cleavage power "" .  i mean , if all it takes is girl power , then why are they only one thread away from bursting out of their skimpy outfits ?  the film is pg , but really with only some very minor dialogue changes and scene extentions , you'd have yourself one raunchy adult film .  by the way , there's something in the opening credits which says "" based on an idea by the spice girls "" .  wow , they got idea credit !  i certainly wish that was a new trend in hollywood . . .  giving credit for simply having the thought "" say girls , let's make a movie !

0|"i read the new yorker magazine and i enjoy some of their really in-depth articles about some incident .  they will take some incident like the investigation of a mysterious plane crash and tell you what happened in detail .  it becomes a real education in what agencies get involved and how theories are suggested , and what kind of pressure the investigators are under , and just about any other aspect you can think of .  frequently i get the feeling that the article sounded exciting , but i am being told in more detail than i really wanted to know .  often i get to the middle of a story and say , ok , it sounded good but i now have invested more time than i am willing to spend on this subject .  film is a different medium .  it is a visual medium .  that slows down the telling of stories much more than people realize .  i frequently am surprised to find out how short a film script is and how much of the pages are empty space .  the magazine article and the film script are two very different media .  the insider is a film adaptation of the vanity fair article "" the man who knew too much "" by marie brenner .  it is too much an adaptation of a magazine article slowed to the pace of a film .  it really verges on being tedious at least at times .  for years the seven big companies knew that they dealt in an addictive drug that caused a host of unhealthy side-effects .  but they pretended for the public that it was unproven and they did not really believe it .  the business was incredibly profitable and the proceeds translated into the political power to squelch and discredit any political movements against big tobacco .  the tide turned when a former vice-president of one of the companies was convinced by the cbs 60 minutes news team to tell the public how much the tobacco companies really knew about the health effects of smoking .  the resulting pressure to stop the story created a small civil war at cbs .  who were the major people involved , what were their motives , how was the story almost killed , how did it get aired anyway ?  that is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider .  this all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well .  and in the end , he failed .  to make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short .  the film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist .  we get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand .  they go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) .  there the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it .  this seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world .  terrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power .  incongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home .  we discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly .  he had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family .  rather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income .  meanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand .  they offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data .  wigand's severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms .  he is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman .  in spite of the secrecy , wigand's former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role .  and so the game begins .  wigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer .  meanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family .  the film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants .  wigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out .  he and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight .  al pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider .  the story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail .  the film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience .  the musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory .  it puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling .  also disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace .  plummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well-known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly .  this film might have been a really engaging experience under another director's control .  michael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style .  i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

""  i never , even for an instant , had the foggiest idea why eye would fall so in "" love "" with this woman who changes wigs and kills people .  the movie offers only two explanations , neither of which make a lick of sense .  explanation number one : the obnoxious presence of eye's imaginary daughter , who was taken away from him by his wife some time ago , tells him he shouldn't leave ms . judd .  explanation two , which by the end of the film has been beaten into our heads through imagery and dialog and even the title of the movie : "" beauty is in the eye of the beholder . ""  whoo hoo , that helps , thanks a bunch , case closed .  that's as deep as it gets , folks .  there is an attempt at an explanation in the final minutes , which , instead of tying everything together , ends up being as profound as a clever sixth-grade mad lib .  there are secondary characters that move in and out of the picture and serve little or no purpose except to make the audience wonder what the hell the point was .  my personal favorites include : the prison-matron modeled after austin powers' frau farbissina , who apparently taught ms . judd everything she knows about wearing wigs ; jason priestley's awfully played dirty desert vagrant #1 , who tries to emulate dennis hopper a la blue velvet , but fails miserably ; and the cop-who-sees-ashley-fleeing-an-accident-scene-and- then-wants-to-pay-for-sex- but-is-shot .  each one in this sad little parade is a little more pointless than the last .  the script pays no attention to the laws of time and space .  any time one of the frequent location changes occurs , the camera zooms in on a souvenir snow globe , and minutes , weeks , or years could have passed .  bewilderingly inane stylistic decisions plague the whole affair - one character passes a glass of cognac to another in a slow-motion close-up awash in a lot of bass .  ewan mcgregor at one point takes up residence in a bell tower just so he could be repeatedly awakened and deafened by the giant bell .  jason priestly starts philosophizing about sharks , then laughs maniacally . . .  cut to random guy with eye patch . . .  iguana out of focus . . .  iguana comes into focus .  wow , man .  when i found out afterward that this film was based on a novel , it came as no surprise to me .  there are plenty of elements here that , if extended and fleshed out more , would have made for a decent story .  and i wouldn't be surprised if i found out there was an hour and a half of footage cut from this movie lying in a landfill somewhere , or waiting in the wings for the dvd special director's cut . . .  not that anything would ever possess me to purchase such a thing to find out what i was missing .  the last ten or so minutes featured a conversation between the eye and the judd that was supposed to be some sort of revealing exposition .  some guy in the back of the theater was talking on his cell phone , and this time i didn't particularly care all that much because what was happening on the screen was a steaming pile of unholy crap ; the audience around me chuckled and whispered sentiments similar to what i was thinking .  someone near cell-phone-guy did eventually yell , "" shut the hell up !
