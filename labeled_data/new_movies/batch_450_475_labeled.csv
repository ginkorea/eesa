1|"scarface , a remake of the 1932 film of the same name , is a very gripping and , as far as i know , a true-to-life story of how power and violence lead to corruption .  al pacino , as tony montana ( for whom the movie is named ) , also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami .  oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles .  the film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states .  many of these cubans had criminal records , such as tony montana , a cocky , fast-talking man who has the look of crime .  nearly right after his arrival in miami , tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry .  along with his friend and partner , manolo ( steven bauer ) , tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez ( robert loggia ) , a high-roller in the organized crime field .  tony also begins to fall in love with elvira ( michelle pfeiffer ) , who at the time was frank's lover .  of course , sooner or later in this industry , betrayal and corruption amount into a force greater than anything else , and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to this force .  this is not before he becomes one of the most respected , and often feared , men in miami .  tony gets to the point where he cannot trust anyone , and everyone he knows basically feels the same way towards him .  no one can trust him , and basically , no one does .  scarface , although incredibly violent , is one of the best crime films of its time and stands out as another great performance for al pacino .  although he did not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance , it truly is a very good one .  in fact , his accent and facial movements alone are enough in my mind to win at least a nomination ( although he did get a golden globe nomination ) .  another element that stands out when someone mentions this film is the profanity .  a figure tagged to the film boasts that the word "" fuck "" and it's uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film , which is apparently a record .  the thing is , the vulgarity fits rather well with the movie .  as odd as it sounds , it's true .  in the end , scarface is a very powerful film that hits home hard .

1|"trekkies , roger nygard's energetic and hilarious documentary , brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions .  the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non-fans alike .   ( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs . trekker polemic as not worth arguing about . )  the good-spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable , loud giggles , yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe .  denise crosby , who played tasha yar on "" star trek : the next generation , "" serves as the host .  in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary ( oed ) .   ( the oed cites a february , 1976 caption in the "" new yorker "" as the first recorded usage of the word . )  unless you've been to the conventions , i posit that you have no idea of the dedication of some of the fans .  one pointed out , apologetically , that the stripe on his new uniform was slightly inaccurate .  others talked about how many star trek conventions they had attended , several dozen being typical and hundreds not unheard of .  my personal favorite fan is sir speedy photocopying worker barbara adams .  arguably the most famous of all the trekkies , she wears her uniform every waking hour as many die-hard fans do .  her claim to fame is that , as a juror on the whitewater trial , she wore it in court as well .   "" every day i would walk past the reporters with a vulcan-like stoicism , "" she says , describing her way of dealing with the crowd of reporters who became obsessed with her obsession .  she doesn't quite understand all of the uproar .   "" i'm an officer of the federation 24 hours a day , "" she reminds us .  her fealty to her hobby approaches that of a religious faith .  along with the laugher the show evokes , there is an equal measure of sincere appreciation for people with such loyalty .  and their infectious joy provokes a certain envy of their enjoyment .  few other avocations could give this much satisfaction .  these people are having the time of their lives .   ( for the record , i'm not a star trek fan although i have seen some of the movies . )  the film interviews the various star trek series's stars as well as its fans .  the stars had thought the convention idea was a lark and would soon fade , but over twenty years later , the conventions are still going strong .  filled with anecdotes , the show talks about the happenings at the various conventions .  at one , the actor who plays q was so sick that he thought he would have to cancel .  after appearing briefly , he drank some water and left .  they decided to auction off his half-empty glass , joking that it had the "" q virus . ""  the guy who won the bidding immediately drank the water and screamed to the crowd that he now had the q virus too .  with dedication comes a certain amount of stupidity .  not just flitting among people , the documentary takes the time to let you get to know the trekkies .  one guy is a trekkie cross-dresser , another dresses her cat , and then there is the dentist .  the dentist has his entire office made up to look like a star trek set .  he , his oral hygienists , his receptionist , his wife , and his kids wear the outfits all of the time .  it appears that his workers are permitted to take them off when they go home , but not his family .  for variety , he and his family do change characters from time to time .  he says his patients like it .  well , there was this one complainer , but he had a problem with his bill anyway .  there are summer schools for klingon with ph . d . linguists to teach the language .  hamlet is now available in klingon , albeit perhaps not at your local bookstore , and they are working on translating the bible .  they even sell united federation passports that are real enough that trekkies have used them to fool customs , even u . s . customs .  the movie bogs down only briefly when it tries to argue the series's larger meaning about diversity and humanitarian concerns .  sandwiched in-between the levity , the switch in tone doesn't work .  the incessantly up-beat film ends with a singing elvis impersonator .  he fits right in .  trekkies runs a breezy 1 : 26 .  it is not rated but would be pg for brief sexual references and would be fine for all ages .

1|"if you're the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland , you're going to love the hunt for red october .  you'll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics , or if you're a sean connery or alec baldwin fan , or if you admired director john mctiernan's earlier films , die hard and predator .  in fact , the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book , since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them .  the hunt for red october is an epic thriller , adapted from tom clancy's best selling novel .  set in an era before glasnost , the movie revolves around a top-secret soviet submarine , called the red october .  the nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system , which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection .  the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius , played by sean connery .  ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine , but he has other ideas .  he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean .  is he planning to start world war iii ?  cia analyst jack ryan doesn't think so ; he's convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u . s . ryan , played by alec baldwin , is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub .  the characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin , but the performances , thankfully , are rock solid .  baldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor .  sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery's somber first officer .  it's ironic to see neil and connery playing russians , since they are both best known for their roles as british agents , connery as james bond and neil as reilly , "" ace of spies . ""  the large cast also includes scott glenn , james earl jones , tim curry , and joss ackland , plus richard jordan as the smooth u . s . national security adviser .  the special effects are remarkable , but more than anything , the hunt for red october is distinguished by its water-tight plot .  screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns .  they keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment .  the movie doesn't get as sweaty or breathless as die hard , because it would rather tell a good story than hit you over the head with non-stop action .  the finale is rousing and suspenseful , but essentially , the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler .

1|"i was pleasantly surprised by this film .  with a budget topping $200 million , i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see .  how much could you dress up the sets ?  how many models and computer effects could you use ?  how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks ?  oh , if i've just given away part of the plot for you , go back to school .  after having viewed titanic , however , i found it to be a well-paced , well-designed , and overall well-made movie .  there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic , but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i've seen .  titanic tells its story in two time periods .  it starts out in the present , when ocean explorer brock lovett ( bill paxton ) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic , searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship .  what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace , which is broadcast on the news .  the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett , who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas .  there she tells her story to lovett and his team .  in 1912 , rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) , a young lady belonging to society's upper class , boards the titanic for the ship's first atlantic crossing , from southampton , england to new york .  she is engaged to cal hockley ( billy zane ) , an heir to old money , and a snob in every sense of the word .  on board , rose feels the stifling trappings of high-society's expectations , and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic's stern , but is saved from her self-proclaimed fate by jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a passenger in third-class ( "" steerage "" , as it's referred to ) , who talks her out of jumping .  although for rose the attraction is not immediate , a love affair soon develops between the two , which endangers rose's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal .  the story sounds very simple , and perhaps even unexciting , but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron , a good movie comes through .  dicaprio is marvelous as the young , but worldly-wise jack , playing the role with the confidence usually found in older actors .  his is a character that is immediately likable , as he knows what he wants out of life and is charmingly able to handle a variety of situations .  girls are going to swoon over him .  winslet also proves herself a good actress , delivering her lines convincingly , and the quality of performances between winslet and dicaprio makes the relationship believable .  the only problem with winslet is that she does not carry herself in accordance with her character's upbringing .  simply by judgment of her gait , i was distracted from the fact that she was supposed to be an upper-crust debutante .  rather than demonstrate the poise one would expect her character to possess , she sometimes looks positively clumsy , and it unfortunately detracts from her otherwise great acting .  billy zane is cast well as the aristocratic snob cal , since he has a certain look that immediately makes you want to hate him .  his features are such that even when he smiles , there's something mistrustful about him , and when he scowls , he is evil incarnate .  he's something like a porcelain version of peter gallagher , but a cheaper model .  like dicaprio and winslet , zane slips comfortably into his role and plays it well .  backing up zane is david warner as lovejoy , cal's personal assistant ( or "" man "" as they said at the turn of the century ) .  no matter who else is in the cast , you can always count on a good performance by warner , who seems to be made to play the distinguished gentleman with a gaze of steel and will to match .  additionally , there are a number of smaller fictional and non-fictional roles thrown in for color , such as kathy bates as "" the unsinkable "" molly brown , danny nucci as jack's friend fabrizio de rossi , eric braeden as john jacob astor , and even bernard fox as colonel archibald gracie .  nice to see dr . bombay getting work .  also scattered about are some of the other steerage passengers who are basically in the movie so you can feel sorry for them when they die .  this by itself may have been largely compulsory in a film about the titanic , but it transcends this status by putting these characters in direct conflict with the ship's crewmembers who strive to maintain order and assure that the first-class passengers are placed aboard the lifeboats before anyone else .  in this way , titanic possesses a depth not usually found in action pictures .  you don't just get a love story with a tragedy as a backdrop , but a very real account of class struggle as well .  as i mentioned before , the budget for this film was tremendous , and it certainly showed in the set dressing and special effects .  the interiors of the titanic are nearly breathtaking with their elaborate trimmings and intricate detail , and one has very little doubt that the layouts are authentic .  with regard to the exteriors , i would dare anyone to point out a film in which a vessel has been recreated with such meticulousness or on such a scale .  cameron actually built a scale model of the titanic in a water tank , but only had room for 90% , and therefore had to computer-generate the remaining 40 feet .  could've fooled me and everyone else in the theater , as the splicing is seamless .  also of note in this film is the way the audience is presented with the anatomy of the disaster right at the beginning .  we are told of where the iceberg struck the ship , how the flooding occurred , the way the ship sank , and why it did so in that manner .  these technical details serve as a guide for later on when the action starts happening , and allow us to view the sinking with informed analytic detraction , in addition to the more conventional placement in the midst of mayhem and confusion .  in all , james cameron's titanic is a good blend of love story , history , and action .  the fact that the film runs longer than most at about three hours is almost unnoticed as the viewer's attention is held alternately by those three main elements , from the movie's intriguing beginning to it's satisfactory ending .  in box office receipts , titanic the movie will undoubtedly live up to the unsinkable expectations of titanic the ship .

1|"it was easy to fear the worst .  begin with a classic 1960's television series , add a big budget and an a-list star in the lead role , and stir .  script , you ask ?  who needs one , kid . . .  we've got ourselves a formula .  that was my fear : a bloated monster without any sense of direction .  then , much to my amazement , everything that could possibly go wrong . . .  didn't .  the fugitive is as lean , taut and tense as anything the action genre has produced in the last several years .  under the direction of andrew davis ( 1992's under siege ) , the fugitive grips you by the throat from the outset and never lets go .  expect box office to go through the roof , deservedly , and expect an academy award nomination for tommy lee jones .  the premise is a simple one .  dr . richard kimble ( harrison ford ) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer , a man with an artificial arm .  after an escape attempt by some other prisoners during a transfer goes awry , kimble finds himself on the run .  his one goal : to find the one-armed man ( andreas katsulas ) before u . s . marshall sam gerard ( tommy lee jones ) finds him .  where the fugitive surprises the most is the script , by jeb stuart and david twohy .  in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic , the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence , its attention to detail and its respect for the audience .  in an early sequence , kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard , slick back his hair and change into a lab coat .  on his way out , a police officer jokingly tells the man he doesn't know is kimble to zip up his pants .  it's a small moment , but it punches home the urgency of kimble's situation , and exactly what a man concerned about not being recognized might easily forget .  later , while trying to lose himself in a parade , kimble thinks to drop his overcoat , the most likely way he'd be recognized from behind .  it's these details which convince us that when a colleague of kimble's tells gerard that he's too smart to be caught , he may just be right .  credit must also be given to the special effects and stunt coordinators .  the bus crash which allows kimble's escape is a spectacular sequence , as is a leap from a dam into the water below .  the action is crisp and brutal , and never romanticized .  special kudos go to director davis for maintaining a relentless pace which underscores the single-mindedness of the two leads .  and what a pair of performances those leads are .  tommy lee jones is nothing short of brilliant as gerard , because he manages an incredibly challenging feat .  for the first third of the film , there is really no * villain * per se ; kimble is on the run , and gerard is out to find him .  it would have been very easy to turn gerard into a malevolent , vindictive inspector javert , but that never happens .  instead jones plays him as a sharp , committed man who's just doing his job , so that when he responds to kimble's comment , "" i didn't kill my wife , "" with a matter-of-fact , "" i don't care , "" we know exactly what he means .  it's not his job to determine guilt or innocence .  it's his job to bring in a fugitive .  this is a well- written character played with relish by an actor at the top of his form .  the only unfortunate thing about jones' stunning turn is that it's likely to overshadow harrison ford , and that's a shame .  for his entire career , ford has been underappreciated as an actor due to his pigeonholing as an action hero .  however , he does a fine job with the less flashy part of kimble , always keeping at the forefront the advantage this man has because of his intelligence .  the fugitive could only work to its fullest if the two protagonists always seemed to be on equal footing , and ford is up to the task .  this summer has been loaded with action/suspense films , and most of them have been doing brisk business .  however , it's time for clint , sean , and various dinosaurs to step aside .  the chase is on .  my advice is to catch it .

""  it took him sixteen words to do as whole dissertations have tried and failed : equate god and abstract art and offer a kind of backhanded comfort to those confused to the point of resentment by the concept .  the biopic _pollock_ , actor ed harris' directorial debut , reflects the second soundbite in how it accepts pollock's creations as part of the order of things , and should similarly disarm haters of fine art .  arguably more than any other living actor , harris , who also plays _pollock_ , embodies the archetypal working stiff , and his blue-collar demystification of pollock's labour-intensive art , both as performer and director , makes for unpretentious cinema .   ( from what i know of harris , he , like pollock , was not born gifted or lucky ; instead , a strong work ethic is the seed of his success . )  granted , it's possible that _pollock_ will alienate those same viewers perplexed by the imponderable "" purpose "" of pollock's splatter series : the common thread between them is a lack of editorializing .  the movie _pollock_ is all purposeful gazes and silent exchanges dotted by tantrums , but the motivations are left to our own perceptions .  and it is a sympathetic yet not altogether forgiving film , as illustrated by a disheartening conclusion .  _pollock_ encapsulates the period in which he fought a losing battle against personal demons ( alcoholism , depression , and the general attendant miseries of an artist ) while finding a place of subconscious expression .  a brief introduction to pollock's raging drunk side segues into his getting accosted by a fellow new york artist , lee krasner ( marcia gay harden , awarded a best supporting actress oscar for this brilliant portrayal ) , who works from the outside-in , pre-intellectualizing every stroke of her brush .  in a scene after they have moved in together and established adjoining studios , she asks what he hopes to achieve on his latest canvas , grilling him about the interplay of cubism and surrealism until he says , "" you paint the fucking thing , "" and leaves in a huff .  by the time they wed , she has become his de facto manager ; it is form marrying function and chaos marrying discipline , a most harmonious collision .   ( krasner denies him a baby , indicating that it would upset the balance . )  such a union is destined to implode , and i hope i'm not ruining the _pollock_ experience by saying that it does .  while it is never depicted as a very romantic matrimony to start--pollock and wife channel their passions elsewhere--their symbiosis leaves each other picked dry after several years , and it comes down to krasner suffering one of pollock's conniptions too many : "" you are killing me !  you are killing me !  you are killing me ! ""   ( aside : harris' own wife , amy madigan , is unrecognizable and exceptional as gallery diva peggy guggenheim . )  pollock himself moves on to dalliances with younger women like ruth klingman ( the scorching jennifer connelly ) , hoping , one supposes , to catch the revitalizing whiff of youth .  i love jackson pollock's stuff and i am enamoured of harris' _pollock_ as well .  it's scrappy and observant ; no coincidence that its minor failings are the occasional invasive flourish , such as jeff beal's hummable but no less lamentable score--i can't imagine that pollock , or anyone , would paint to this music , which puts filling soundtrack voids ahead of complementing the images .  one of my favourite sequences is an eerily quiet re-enactment of hans namuth shooting that famous pollock footage in east hampton , long island ; the mounting tension is almost comic , as namuth keeps interrupting pollock's process to reload his camera or take a dinner break .  a more seasoned director might've been too arrogant to admit that not all artists or mediums are created equal .

1|it's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast .  sure , there have been delightful outings like last years hercules .  but nothing entirely groundbreaking .  with the release of the studio's newest feature length film , a remake of edgar rice burrough's creation tarzan , disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques .  it's no classic , but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be .  the plot is loyal to the original storyline , as tarzan's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire , and find shelter in the jungles of africa .  but , they are killed ( offscreen ) by the snarling cheetah sabor , leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib .  found by kala ( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close ) , a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack , tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own .  we follow the young boy through the years , as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk ( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell ) and clumsy elephant tantor ( wayne knight ) .  of course , in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero .  in tarzan , these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously .  gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here .  most of the characters are amusing without being forced .  as tarzan grows to manhood , the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture .  here , the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , who's accompanying a hapless professor ( nigel hawthorne ) on an expedition through the jungle .  of course , there's the professor's daughter , jane ( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver ) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie .  the thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation .  directors chris buck and kevin lima have applied a breathtaking 3-d element to the movement of the athletic title character , and the fast-paced editing is absolutely a marvel .  as tarzan carries jane through the treetops , narrowly escaping a pack of nasty baboons , he slips and slides like a daredevil snow boarder or star surfer riding the big wave .  your eyes can barely keep up ; it's a fantastic accomplishment .  the subject matter here is also a notch or two above animation average .  there are important questions raised about tarzan's place in the world , and all are handled exceptionally well by the screenwriters .  there is no shred of doubt left to ponder afterward , which is a surprising plus that i wasn't expecting to find here .  suffice to say , this film will have both adults and children thoroughly entertained .  the grown-up tarzan is voiced by tony goldwyn , who made a name for himself as the `big mean jerk' from ghost .  goldwyn is effective playing someone who's not aware of his world's dangers .  glenn close is also memorable as his gorilla mother , and lance henriksen ( from tv's millennium ) is terrific as the silverback father unsure of how to accept the presence of a human child .  as the movie's villain , there is nothing particularly special or catching about the character of clayton .  it helps that brian blessed supplies his voice with game enthusiasm , but he is nothing compared to james woods' hilarious hades from hercules .  a burley guy with a big gun who just wants to capture the gorillas does not quite constitute for an all-together noticeable screen presence .  still , this is one great thrill-ride that disney has constructed .  i never expected rice burrough's work to be transformed so successfully from live action to animation , nor with so much emotional depth .  parents , along with all the kiddies , are going to find much to like in tarzan .  |0.6666666666666666|0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|The text overwhelmingly expresses a positive sentiment towards the new Tarzan movie, highlighting its family-friendly nature, stunning animation, thoughtful handling of important questions, and ability to entertain both adults and children.

1|"warning : if you actually wish to see the film , stop reading this and see it .  while i don't blow any plot details , the more you know about a movie , the more disappointing and built up it becomes ( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing ) .  but , in a nutshell , it's a good film .  star wars episode i : the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim  never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation ) , it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment , the phantom menace .  however , it can't be ignored .  endless toys lining the shelves , endless news reports , and a multi-billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult .  with the level of this hype , one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998 , godzilla , which definitely failed to live up to expectations .  thankfully , the phantom menace does much , much better .  while the "" first "" star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker , the prequels backpedal to tell the back-story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker ( who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader ) .  without blowing too much of the story , the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo , which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation , and it's up to two jedi knights ( qui-gon ji , played by liam neeson and obi-wan kenobi , played by ewan mcgreggor ) to free it .  the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics , leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat .  common complaints range from lack of characterization , weak narrative , poor direction of actors , the dated style , and too much focus over special effects .  still , film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism , much of which the average film buff does not care for .  hence , this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films ( even with the "" improvements "" in the special editions ) .  there are many memorable sequences throughout the film , ranging from the fast and furious "" pod race "" sequence ( which is a take on the chariot races in "" ben hur "" ) and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids .  utilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before , special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail .  no matter how many times you watch this film , you will catch something new .  the level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well , mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks , who belongs to a race known as the gungans .  best described as an mr . bean from the planet naboo , he steals the show .  unfortunately , being that he is a computer-generated character , tells a bit about the direction of the actors ( although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective , as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker ) .  with star wars mania at an all time high , there is the risk that the film will disappoint ( i myself had my doubts ) , which this film does have a tendency to do at times .  there are a few logic problems with the plot , several things are left unchecked , and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans ( although the appearance of the tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs ) .  that , and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character , coming off as a smarmy , arrogant brat ( with such an attitude , it's no wonder why he turns to the dark side ) .  still , it seems that many people , especially critics , are missing the point .  the film is some of the most fun 2 and a half hours that you'll blow in your life , which is something i wouldn't mind doing again .  while it may not have the psychological impact of an academy award contender , who really cares ?  the film is pure fun from beginning to end .  and isn't that what really matters ?

1|"it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system .  no major surprise , when j . s . mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either .  the americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist , the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority .  small wonder that hollywood's most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart , born on the fourth of july , rocky , first blood , clear and present danger , jfk , the list goes on .  there's little of that in singapore - we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line , though the government's been long worried about the younger people getting "" americanised "" and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition .  the people vs . larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america - sex .  does pornography have a right to exist and circulate ?  larry flynt , the publisher of hustler magazine , thinks so , and obviously so too the u . s . congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net .  but even with such actions , americans remain undecided .  the oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire .  what they have ignored is actually a great picture .  woody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to-hell-with-morality , to-hell-with-the-law , and to-hell-with-the-system anti-christ that we last saw in natural born killers .  and he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly .  the latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself .  edward norton plays their jerky lawyer .  the relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who've had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids .  god's damnation .  but in the powerful love they have for each other , each standing by the other in turn , the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and ( in the american context ) a christian , if they can love and care , and feel just like anyone else on a personal level .  friedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral-christian influences .  to go beyond good and evil .  this is a great picture , no doubt , and i love it personally .  because it is moving , funny , ends with open american optimism blah blah .  but i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions , and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases .  there are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities .  this movie is not so much about larry flynt , but about americans and american society .

1|"deep rising is one of "" those "" movies .  the kind of movie which serves no purpose except to entertain us .  it does not ask us to think about important questions like life on other planets or the possibility that there is no god . . . screw that , it says boldly , let's see some computer generated monsters rip into , decapitate and generally cause irreparable booboos to a bunch of little known actors .  heh !  them wacky monsters , gotta love 'em .  of course , since we can rent about a thousand b movies with the same kind of story , hollywood must give that little extra "" oumph "" to get people in theaters .  that is where deep rising fails , which is a good thing .  confused ?  let me explain :  despite all them flashy effects and big explosions , deep rising is still , at heart , a good 'ol b movie .  luckily , it's a very good b movie .  the worst cliches in movie history are a b movie's bread and butter .  therefore , things that would destroy a serious movie actually help us have a good time while watching a movie of lower calibre .  of course we know there's a big slimy creature behind that door , that one person will wander off to be picked off by said monster and we always know which persons or person will make it out alive .  we just don't know when or how horrible it will be .  i went to see deep rising with my expections low and my tolerance for bad dialogue high .  imagine my surprise when i discover that deep rising is actually , well , pretty darn funny at times .  a funny b movie ?  well , that's new .  these flicks are not supposed to make us laugh .   ( except for a few unintended laughs once a while . )  and before you know it , treat williams , wes studi and famke jansen appear on the big screen .  hey ! i know them guys ( and gal ) from a couple of other movies .  cool .  familiar faces .  so far so good .  our man treat is the hero , he'll live .  wes is a staple of b movies , he is the token victim .  we know he'll buy the farm but he will take a few creeps with him on the way out .  famke is the babe , 'nuff said .  there is also a guy with glasses ( the guy with glasses always dies ) a black person ( b movie buffs know that the black guy always dies , never fails ) and a very funny , nerdy guy .   ( ah !  comic relief .  how can we possibly explain having to kill him . . . let  him live . )  after the first fifteen minutes i felt right at home .  i know who to root for and who i need to boo too and a gum to chew .   ( please kill me . )  suffice it to say that for the next hour and a half i jumped out of my seat a few times , went "" ewwww "" about a dozen times and nearly had an orgasm over all the explosions and firepower our heroes were packing .  i'm a man , we nottice these things .  all in all , i'd recommend deep rising if you are looking for a good time and care to leave your brain at the door . . . but  bring your sense of humor and excitement in with you .  the acting is decent , the effects top rate .  how to best describe it ?  put together the jet ski scene from hard rain , the bug attacks from starship troopers , a couple of james bond like stunts and all those scenes from friday the thirteenth and freddy where you keep screaming "" don't go there , he's behind you "" and you end up with deep rising .  for creepy crawly goodness , tight t-shirts , major firepower and the need to go to the bathroom every fifteen minutes from seing all that water .

1|"vampire films , as well as other horror films , are usually dumb and predictable b-movies , meant to scare us by cliches and simple shocks .  it is therefore interesting to watch neil jordans recent film that is not only visually stunning , but has also a plot worth making movies about .  based on anne rice's novel , "" interview with a vampire "" is a long , dark trip to hell .  the film opens with gothic quire and dark streets of present-day san francisco .  the camera slowly find particular window .  a shape of a young man is visible in the darkness .   "" so you want me to tell you the story of my life ? "" .  the mysterious man is louis ( brad pitt ) , a two-century old vampire , telling his story to a fascinated interviewer ( christian slater ) .  his tale opens in 1791 louisiana , just south of new orleans , where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat ( tom cruise ) .  given a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead , louis chooses the latter , a decision he will forever regret .  everlasting life and eternal youth , promised to him by lestat , turn instead into never ending suffering , damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace .  louis cannot kill with the impunity of lestat , but , to sate his hunger , he must feed , and the blood of animals is not enough .  eventually , he pierces the neck of a grief-stricken young girl named claudia ( kirsten dunst ) , whom lestat then curses with his unholy form of resurrection so that she can be a surrogate daughter to both himself and louis .  for a while , they are one "" big , happy family . ""  but all things end , and claudia's growing resentment of lestat fuels a bloody confrontation .  when luis and claudia break loose from lestat , they travel to paris , where the euro-vamps santiago ( stephen rea ) and armand ( antonio banderas ) , who introduced them to a bigger world of the damned .  director neil jordan ( "" the crying game "" ) together with the talented director of cinematography philippe rousselot and composer elliot goldenthal has created an incredible atmosphere .  as the film begins , there is an incredible palette of colors , beautiful sunrises , lush golden fields , green forests , inky-blue clouds and blending sun .  when luis is "" born to darkness "" , everything suddenly changes to dark velvet , lit only by the silver moonlight .  the beautiful production design by dante ferretti , wonderful costumes and art direction by malcolm middleton re-create the multiple historical periods in the film .  from the renaissance new orleans and the beautiful rococo paris of the 18th century , to our present days .  the casting is likewise good , involving some of the most famous and beautiful stars of hollywood , ireland and spain .  the controversial casting of tom cruise as lestat is incredibly effective .  cruise is energetic , sinister , charismatic , wild and bloodthirsty .  cruise's lestat likes to seduce young women before exacting his dark red sustenance .  with alarming swiftness , the victims switch from sexual excitement to outright horror , as his murderous purpose becomes clear .   "" . . . kill them mercifully , but do it .  you are what you are . . for  do not doubt , you are a killer ! ""  that is how lestat is teaching luis .  but behind that furious facade is anger and loneliness that he carries through the centuries and tries to smother with nightly rampages .  brad pitt is equally convincing as the "" vampire with a human soul "" .  antonio banderas and stephen rea are effective , but since they play more or less secondary characters , their performances are almost invisible .  the greatest performance in the film comes suprisingly from the young kristen dunst , who manages to create an incredibly emotional and believable character .  the world is changing around the little child , but she does not .  she remains unchangeable - a child for all eternity .  only her wise , dark eyes reveal her age .  ironically the film's only miss is the script .  anne rice's novel is a very interesting read , and her script is rich , colorful and emotional , but it is also tiering and too melancholic , at times resembling a soap opera :  claudia : "" . . . . is that what i should do ?  let you go . . my  father , my luis , who made me . . . who will look after me , my dark angel , when you are gone ? ""  luis : "" everything will be alright . . ""  claudia : "" do you really believe that ? ""  and then they hug emotionally .  moments like those displayed above and luis' self-pity is a bit tiresome .  however rice's script is otherwise strong and well structured , bringing up humor and comic episodes , that were more or less hidden in the book .  when lestat finds claudia's dead dressmaker , whom she has killed , he cries out : "" who will make you that dress now ?  be a little practical . . . . never  in the house ! ""  moments like that are both entertaining and appealing .  neil jordan's direction is beautiful and sensual as he plays with interesting issues like eternity , homosexuality , love and loneliness .  his gothic saga is not meant to scare , but to display these issues differently .  wrapped up in mystery , his new , original picture brings vampire-films to a new height .

1|"this has some major spoilers for the film , so be forwarned .  the won't appear till later in the article , so you're safe for now .  eyes wide shot ( 1999 ) running time : 2 hours 39 minutes 2 . 35 : 1 theatrical aspect  starring : tom cruise ( dr .  bill hardford ) , nicole kidman ( alice hardford ) , sidney pollack , leelee sobieski , todd field ( nick nightingale ) directed , co-written , produced by : stanley kubrick inspired by : "" traumnovelle "" by : arthur schnitzer  this is an interesting film .  i must first off state , that you musn't believe any of the rumors of the film .  cruise is not a cross dresser , kidman doesn't shoot heroin , and there's not any scene between the two that would suggest that they were aided by a sex therapist .  the look of the film is to suggest that it follows the translation of the inspired book from the film was written .  the translation , "" dream novel , "" makes you thing that the film should have been titled dream film .  there is a noticable amount of graininess to the film .  rather than complain about it as some may and already have , see it as a style of shooting .  i would gather that kubrick got on another lighting kick shooting this and shot with as much natural light as he could .  this and the film looks like it was pushed another two stops to add more grain and brighten it slightly .  as an auteur and stickler for details , kubrick seemed to be a bit lax on this one .  the film looks great , but there are a good deal of bloopers/flubs that occur .  you see lots of boom shots ( in reflection ) and you see the camera at least twice .  16 months for this ?  wow .  reflection is the biggest killer for this film .  their apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly .  one more topic of heated discussion : i saw the "" austin powers "" version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you'll probably not see them .  two girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it's supposed to be .  spoilers below :  the film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x-mas soiree .  they go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack .  bill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party's entertainment .  soon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed .  bill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time .  the next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations .  they both discover that they both knew about the flirting .  bill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry .  in her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects .  bill gets called away when one of his patients dies , and goes to console his daughter .  when his patient's engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection , he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife , alice and a naval officer .  he sees "" opportunity "" as a betrayal to his wife , and before they can continue , they are interrupted .  as he strolls home , he encounters a hooker .  seeing another "" opportunity "" arise , he follows the hooker home .  they toy around , but before the act ensues , alice calls his cell phone .  he breaks the date with the hooker , and heads back out into the night .  he passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing , so he heads in .  when he meets the friend , the friend reveals that for extra scratch , he plays these strange parties , while blindfolded .  bill is intrigued and wants to go to one .  nick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password .  what follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl , leelee sobieski , and her father .  the young girl has drawn his eye , but her young age , and the prescence of her father deter this from happening .  he gets to the party , which is to say the least , a strange affair .  after partaking in some strange "" religious "" right , women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies .  a woman warns bill in disguise , that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party .  he is detained after a second warning , where he is outed for not being in the group .  after getting home , he hides the evidence of his evenings events .  unable to carry on in his day , he tries piece the events of the previous night together .  in the process , he finds that nick has disappeared , his life is possibly in danger , and the woman that warned him has died .  i'm trying to save a bit of the film here , it's worth sitting through to get to this point .  this is only about 100 minutes at this point .  this is a strange film , because despite the events that occur , the film has a strong family message behind it .  it will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film .  it's got sex in it , it has nudity , drugs , and many more immoralistic values .  but they all serve to show why they are bad in one's life .  i recommend this film highly on many merits .  cruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene , and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself .

1|"one fun activity for parents during the holidays is to suggest an old film and see if they can interest their kids .  although black-and-white films are frequently viewed as suspect , ones in color are greeted with more of an open mind .  and if you can find a colorful action film , even if it is from six decades ago , then there is a real possibility of a take home hit .  so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood , a high spirited version of the walter scott story .  nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold's melodramatic music , ralph dawson's fast paced editing and carl jules weyl's lush sets , the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn's charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley , a . k . a . robin hood .  flynn , with his handsome figure and toothy smile , charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself .  let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household .  the littlest rhodes , jeffrey , age 8 , liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more .  i'll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review .  simply stated , the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre , the swashbuckler .  robin , with a smile from ear-to-ear , fights off a hundred men without a scratch .  although the picture can be considered as little more than a 1930's james bond , the production values and the acting raise it above that level .  robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor .  robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows .  in this movie , however , he seems much less interested in income redistribution than in fighting for his king and country .  robin , with his courage and athletic skills , serves as a role model for kids .  and with the lovely olivia de havilland playing the dreamy-eyed lady marian fitzswalter , the story has heavy romantic overtones .  filmed in the typical , richly oversaturated colors produced by early technicolor , the flesh tones are overly pink and there few color subtleties , which match perfectly the wonderfully exaggerated acting of the players .  in scene after scene the picture charms the audience .  who wouldn't fall for robin as he shows up incognito to win the archery contest , even if the outcome is so clearly preordained .  and , of course , he doesn't just win , he does so by splitting the other man's arrow .  watching the picture today does provide some jarring moments .  sherlock holmes as the villain , sir guy of gisbourne , for example , just doesn't seem right , even if basil rathbone did have a real-life identity outside of his most famous role .  and then there are those wigs from the makeup department -- so bad , they look like rejects from a mel brooks comedy .  as was popular in the cinema of that era , people die with the most gentle prick of the sword and without any nasty , bloody holes to spoil the wardrobe or the looks .  bad guys are banished rather than killed , and lovers go off hand-in-hand , doing nothing more explicitly sexual than kissing .  the result is a wonderful fairy tale of a movie with delightful , cartoonish figures .  hollywood rarely makes such high quality family films like this anymore , so try to savor the old ones when you can .  the adventures of robin hood runs 1 : 42 .  it is not rated , but containing absolutely nothing offensive , it would get a g rating and is fine for all ages .  jeffrey thinks the film is "" great "" and gives it * * * * .  he recommends the movie particularly for people who do not likely bloody pictures -- he hates the sight of blood in movies .  his favorite parts are the battles and the ending , and his favorite characters are robin and king richard ( ian hunter ) .

1|swashbuckling adventure that can be enjoyed by both children and adults .  steven spielberg may not have directed ( he only executive produced ) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie .  and he knows a money making winner when he sees one .  the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster : big action , funny comedy , and the pacing of a rollercoaster .  hopkins plays don diego de la vega , otherwise known as zorro .  a fighter for the people , he is eventually captured by don rafael montero ( stuart wilson ) , who also , unintentionally , kills his wife .  the film cuts to twenty years later , where vega still wants to montero dead .  however , he's far too old now , and trains up thief alejandro murrieta ( banderas ) to become the new zorro .  banderas motive ?  to avenge the death of his brother , who was killed at the hands of captain love ( matthew letscher ) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar , in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie .  with the scene set , the movie goes on full blast , with sword fights a-plenty and witty one liners .  banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro's , playing each other off with ease .  hopkins seems to come off a little better , but banderas does some excellent work .  as the bad guys , wilson and letscher seem one dimensional , but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way .  the audience does hate them , which can't be bad .  catherine zeta-jones also pops up as hopkins daughter , and although she provides little more than the usual female lead , she delivers a charming , but one note , performance .  the chemistry is excellent between banderas and jones .  there's a delightful little scene where banderas and jones have a sword fight , and every swipe an item of clothing gets slashed , until jones clothes fall off all together .  the director , fresh from the enjoyable goldeneye ( 1995 ) handles the film perfectly .  the action is well done and fast paced , the comedy put across well .  the cast help a lot , but the direction is still outstanding .  although the film is very long , the plot keeps chugging along , and there's barely a dull moment .  however , the film is a little over indulgent , and it could have been trimmed .  it manages to hold the attention , thankfully , and the adventure and charm holds right up to the last reel .  screenwriters john eskow , ted elliot and terry rosio have unfortunately written an cliched and one dimensional script .  although they've bought zorro up to date with big explosions and wild action , the plot itself is barely existent .  there's lots of little sub plots hanging around , but there's nothing substantial to bring them all together .  the main story seems to be the fact that rafael wants to 'buy' california using gold stolen from the guy he's buying the land off .  this sets up for a temple of doom type plot where we see peasants slave driven into getting the gold from little mines .  however , this doesn't seem to appear until nearly over a hour into the film , so the film is never quite sure where it's going .  in the end however , zorro provides action and comedy in spades .  it suitable for everyone , so put the guilt behind , and put some more money into spielbergs bank account .  you won't regret it .  |0.8166666666666668|0.9|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive, with praise for the swashbuckling adventure, the chemistry between the actors, and the direction of the film.

1|" "" rebel without a cause "" is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to .  everyone feels that they are different in some way , that they don't belong in some places and "" rebel without a cause "" successfully shows on screen these universal emotions .  no matter what generation you belong to , these feelings are present .  this is why james dean is admired by america , because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute .  in our minds , we just try to do the right thing just like dean's jim stark does .  not only does "" rebel without a cause "" display these universal emotions for all to relate to but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure .  each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection .  this is because times change and in response people change .  no matter how popular you were once , as your generation grows older , newer breeds look at you in a different light .  this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents .  even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past , the teens could not believe this .  in one humorous scene , stark , his girlfriend judy ( natalie wood ) , and his pal plato ( sal mineo ) pretend they are adults .  they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored .  this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another .  speaking on behalf of my generation , i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by .  the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation . same  goes for brando , redford , even deniro .  i can only imagine how vaguely matt damon , ben affleck , and brad pitt will be viewed at the mid point of the twenty first century .  will dean even be remembered when these newcomers are forgotten ?  any film that sparks this kind of thought is certainly a milestone in american film .  even if "" rebel without a cause "" has some ridiculous scenes ( the game of chicken - did people really act this way ? ) , an unbelievable conclusion ( how did everyone end up at the abandoned mansion at the end ? ) , and a silly romance ( wood declares her love for dean after talking to him for a couple hours ) it still is a fabulous film .  the acting is so believable that it is no wonder that dean was considered the epitome of cool .  now , however , the coolness is fading . . .

1|"david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director .  with his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible .  some of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline .  and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right .  oh , and it's rated g .  incidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else's work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century .  he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note .   "" did you do it ? "" he asks his boy .   "" no father , i didn't , "" ronnie answers .  that's enough for arthur , who , with his oldest daughter ( rebecca pidgeon ) , immediately starts a crusade to bring his son's case to court .  they enlist the help of sir robert morton , a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task .  it all seems fairly frivolous , and no matter how you look at it , the winslow case is not the trial of the century .  but arthur is determined to keep his family's word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that .  soon enough , sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings .  so do we .  all david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue , but his style is still fairly apparent .  the characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense .  but this is not mamet's norm , and it's refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks , gangsters as con men , wonderful as those films were .  nigel hawthorne's performance is nearly flawless .  his delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game .  we pity the man , but we also like him .  rebecca pidgeon , david mamet's wife , who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur's oldest daughter , a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women's suffrage movement .  the winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher -- it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one .  be honest : did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill ?  if you wanted to but didn't , this is a movie for you .  it is the epitome of subtlety : it's powerful without being too emotional , sad without even trying to be depressing .  david mamet can churn out some great scripts , but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too .  he is almost a national treasure .  his films deserve their own genre .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  "|0.7906666666666666|0.9166666666666666|0.8333333333333334|"The sentiment of the explanations is overwhelmingly positive towards David Mamet as a screenwriter and director, with praise for his distinctive dialogue, laid-back style, and ability to create complex and riveting films like ""The Winslow Boy.""

1|"catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up .  she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma , but the boy's parents aren't happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life .  as if trying to assure the boy's parents wasn't hard enough on her , a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane's mental faculties .  a vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life-sized dolls .  just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia .  the police , led by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim's body , but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state .  in a last ditch attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher's mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell . . .  a cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours !  initial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix .  while it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm .  the buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . 's "" losing my religion "" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory .  despite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery .  all of the sequences where we delve into someone's mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe .  the first sequence that takes place in stargher's mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i've ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher's victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room .  if the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) .  the cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) .  in my opinion , d'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . -  the newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him .  the character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him .  detractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both .  besides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher's penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling .  a sequence where catherine enters stargher's mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting .  one moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device .  as a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking .  as a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done .  although the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together .  unfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) .

1|"when casting the key part of the voice of moses , most people's first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer ( the saint and the island of dr .  moreau ) , but he was dreamworks's choice in their first traditionally animated movie , the prince of egypt .  the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one , but the biggest risk dreamworks took wasn't in the casting department .  the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic , a la cecil b . demille , to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones .  in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children .  animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies , now that is something fresh .  let me admit up-front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off .  dreamworks's antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group .  the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz , but it is much more satisfying .  like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar's a bug's life , the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices .  danny glover is the voice of jethro , jeff goldblum of aaron , steve martin of hotep , helen mirren of the queen , michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah , martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti .  you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god .  the movie , which is weakest in the story department , is a cliff's notes version of demille's the ten commandments .  the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses's life .  demille took over three and a half hours in order to do it justice .  at less than half of that , the prince of egypt rushes through so much material that it doesn't establish sufficient depth for us to bond with the characters .  we meet moses when the queen finds him floating in his little basket .  we watch him grow up and become best bud and a chariot racing partner to ramses ( ralph fiennes ) , the future pharaoh .  moses is a free spirit and a practical joker until he finds out his true identity as a jew .   ( "" all i've ever known to be true is a lie , "" moses complains . )  after finding out his real identity , he sees for the first time the oppression of the jewish slaves that are all around him .  after leaving egypt , moses comes back to ask ramses to let moses's people go .  this leads to the classic scene of the parting of the red sea , which is one of many places where computers were used to enhance the traditionally hand-drawn animation of the most of the production .  it is the absolutely stunning visuals that make the movie so compelling .  drawn with a rich palette of luxurious roses , blues and golds , the picture looks sumptuous from its first frame to its last .  the construction of the temple is shown in blowing dust , and other scenes are shot with the glow of a rising sun .  the most original visual sequence in the film occurs during a dream moses has .  done with an explicit two-dimensional look , the colorful images painted on the temple walls come to life to tell their own animated story .  even though it has its weaknesses , the prince of egypt is a noble attempt to carve out a new genre -- serious animated movies for adults that are acceptable for the entire family .  this awe-inspiring movie deserves to be seen .  the prince of egypt runs about 1 : 30 .  it is rated pg for thematic elements and would be fine for the whole family .  how old a kid would need to be to be interested depends on the child , but those over 8 will probably like it .

1|" "" . . it's certainly more than just a monster story . . ""  - kenneth branagh , director/actor/co-writer of mary shelley's frankenstein .  kenneth branagh's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein-films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world , including the most controversial version of them all - directed by james whale .  the dark and stormy nights , the lightning bolts , the charnel houses of spare body parts , the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful .  but the center of the film , quieter and more thoughtful , contains the real story .  horror-fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror .  branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues : morality , philosophy and human elements of the story , and not on old fashioned horror cliches .  his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel .  the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean .  the year is 1794 .  a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters .  his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs .  as the ice closes around his ship , a figure appears on the horizon .  it's a man .  exhausted and on the brink of death he approaches the frightening crew .  his name is victor frankenstein ( kenneth branagh ) and his story is so terrifying that it will scare everyone from venturing into the unknown .  the myserious stranger begins his tale , or more precisely his confession , in geneva , 1773 .  he is remembering his childhood and youth .  laughter , banquets and parties - a happy life , without troubles or concerns .  here victor lived with his father ( ian holm ) , mother ( cherie lunghi ) , his surrogate sister ( helena boham carter ) and his servants in happiness and harmony .  this idyllic lifestyle is suddenly changed .  like thunder from a quite sky , his mother dies , giving birth to his youngest brother .  shocked , baffled and then gradually changed by grief and despair , victor ( already interested in science ) becomes obsessed with death .  standing on his mother's grave he says : "" oh mother . . you  did not have to die . . . no one should ever die . . . i  will stop this . . i  promiss . . ""  after proposing marridge to his surrogate sister and promising to return as soon as his studies are finished , victor travels to ingolstadt , in presuite of a medical career .  after a while his obsession totally overtakes him as he is working day and night , creating life from death .  composing dead bodies , frankenstein wanted to create the perfect man - both physically and mentally .  with strong electrical impulses , he managed to breeth life into his creation .  the result was ugliness .  realizing what he has done , frankenstein tried to undo his work , but it was to late .  the creature has escaped .  because of the epidemic , frankenstein hoped that his creation has died and returned to his home , making plans for the wedding .  for a while everything is as it was before his mother's death .  but then one by one his loved once are dying mysteriously . . .  whale's picture , although powerful , never managed to capture the total depth of the novel .  brannagh has more or less done that .  another thing is characters and actors .  branagh has developed every character and assembled a magnificent cast .  the greatest performances comes from de niro - the monster , that has been played by ( among others ) charles ogle , karloff , lon chaney , bela lugosi , glenn strange , christopher lee , fred gwynne ( as herman munster ) , and now , robert de niro .  alone , hated and feared , he is completely aware of his ugliness .  at first he is like a helpless , abandoned child , desperately reaching out for love .  later when he reads frankenstein's journal , and learns that he is composed of dead bodies , his love turns into rage as he is seeking revenge .  he is capable of killing without regret .   "" i took him by the throughout and lifted him off the ground . . . . and  then i slowly crushed his neck . . . and  as i killed him , i saw your face . . ""  that is how he reveals his savage nature to his creator .  and yet , he is never quite evil in our eyes and his vaulerbility and his loneliness are palpable : "" for the sympathy of one living being i would make peace with all . ""  rarely has a cinematic interpretation of "" the daemon "" approached the level of three-dimensionality and humanity with which it is portrayed in the novel .  another vital thing is the character of victor frankenstein .  in most of the previous adaptions he was simply a mad scientist that trolls the graveyards for corpses and then creates a monster ( god knows why ! ) with the power of an electrical storm .  almost no time was granted on his charecter , who is the most important and vital charecter in the novel .  here , branagh introduces the character of victor frankenstein , establishes his obsession with the very nature of life and death , sets up the intellectual and ideological conflict between victor and the academic establishment , and somehow manages to build up to a rousing and horrifying creation scene .  branagh plays frankenstein with a remarkable understanding of his character .  on the outside he is strong , ambitious and talented scientist , but deep down he is unsecure , fragile and vaulerble , constantly haunted by the ghosts from his past .  helen boham carter is equally wonderful as frankenstein's surrogate sister , who at the end becomes his wife for a little while , before death drives them apart .  the rest of the cast , playing secondary characters , is solid and nothing less than convincing .  visually the film is stunning ( especially the makeup ) .  the spinning camera , the constantly building-up musical acore , the art direction , the production design , the costumes are all magnificent : from the arctic ocean to the swiss alps and dark forests , to the plague-riddled streets of ingolstadt , mary shelley's frankenstein is a wonder to behold .  kenneth branagh directs his film as if the script was written by shakespeare : "" . . all  i once loved lies in a shallow grave . . . . by  my hand . . "" .  and the film ends exacly as hamlet , when the creature sets both his and his creator's body on fire .  the film ends with frankenstein and his creation burning in the almost hellish fire in the darkness .  and a terrifying last close-up on the creature's smiling face .  can a man create life , then abandon his creation because its appearance horrifies him ?  to whom are its actions then attributable : the creature or the being who brought about its existence ?  shelley did not answer these questions , but she certainly posed them .  following her example , branagh does the same .  his film is a tragic saga about playing god .  victor frankenstein is not an evil man .  he wanted to change the world to the better .  in this he represents everything science stands for : acting without doubts , never considering the consequences of his actions .  produced by francis ford coppola , frankenstein resembles in some respects coppolas previous film "" dracula "" .  in comparison , i can say that "" dracula "" has visuals that even "" frankenstein "" can not live up to .  but when it comes to story , characters and casting , "" frankenstein "" is stronger .  but stronger than both of them , on every aspect , is neil jordan's "" interview with the vampire "" .  although the film is not perfect ( the camera that simply refuses to stay still and the occasionally pushy score are at times more tiering than effective ) , these minor faults are easily forgivable , as the picture is otherwise captivating and stimulating .  branagh has probably created one of the best ( if not the best ) adaptions of shelly's classic novel .

1|" "" love is the devil "" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist's psyche rather than the artist's lifeline .  watching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter .  everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film's subject , looked at it personally .  but while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what's going on .  exactly what was i looking at ?  watching this film , i wasn't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous .  directed ( and written ) by john maybury , "" love is the devil "" is stylish masterpiece for the senses .  everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing .  the camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close .  the editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon's world and psyche .  as such , there is no real story .  i've not heard much about francis bacon that i didn't read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like .  he was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty .  as played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he's like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero .  he lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him .  it's as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( "" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , "" he says one night at the bar he frequents ) .   "" love is the devil "" chronicles the latter part of his life .  bacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor .  he walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) .  bacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning .  george agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason .  the film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another .  while creating bacon's world of friends ( like "" high art , "" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant .  bacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn't understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings .  while watching this , that's basically all i thought was there .  the film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about .  once the film is over , it's easier to piece it together .  i kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was .  someone doesn't merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in .  thinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother .  i thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer's head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein's "" battleship potemkin "" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain .  he drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn't for george .  i guess that explains the title .  a bit .  that's great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning .  i wish it hadn't reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) .  or maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man's twisted pysche .  it's almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man's uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience's throat .  that way you don't reduce your film to something it's just not .  i can't say i totally enjoyed "" love is the devil , "" though .  despite all of the things i respect about this movie , it's still rather uncomfortable to sit through .  even at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour .  though hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man's truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it .  as such , i respect the way the film looks .  it's beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with "" what dreams may come "" and "" dark city , "" it's the year's most visually stunning film .  in fact , if a better script had been forged , i'd almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever .  and with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs .  i just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance .  then i would have had something to hold me over even now .

1|"let's face it : the $100 million-plus smash that was "" goldeneye "" was not a good film by any means , and as a bond movie was only marginally better than , say , "" a view to a kill "" or either of the timothy dalton pictures , by virtue of nice pacing .  but it did revive the series , and granted the producers some new directions in which to take the it ( ie .  the new "" m "" is a woman ) .   "" tomorrow never dies "" is the picture "" goldeneye "" should have been ; it's also the most entertaining bond outing since "" the spy who loved me "" .  the new picture opens with china considering war with britain after a standard military operation is misconstrued as a hostile threat from an english submarine .  as an attack occurs , the front-page headline is already being prepared , courtesy of carver media .  carver ( pryce ) the man is a deluded magnate , a sort of hybrid of ted turner , bill gates , and peter sellars' german scientist from "" dr .  strangelove "" ( physically , pryce even recalls sellars in his kubrick days ) .  it's up to james bond to take him down , with assistance , of course , from a wealth of gadgets ( including a multi-purpose cell phone ) , and beautiful women .  enter michelle yeoh , fresh from "" supercop "" , as a chinese secret agent with her own agenda ; with effortless grace , she cat burgles , dispatches baddies seemingly with the ease of preparing pasta , and refuses the advances of our philandering hero .  they make a great team .   "" tomorrow never dies "" is a surprisingly entertaining and efficient film , given that at the helm is none other than the director of "" turner & hooch "" .  spottiswoode has crafted some breathtaking set pieces , each much more intricate and impressive than , for instance , the tank scene in "" goldeneye "" .  moreover , brosnan has at last settled into the role some feel he was born to play ; last time out , the fate of the franchise rested on his shoulders , and there was noticeable discomfort in his body language .  returned in brosnan's eyes has some of the playfulness he demonstrated for so many years on tv's "" remington steele "" , as has his deadpan wit .  and though carver's motives are muddy ( when carver explains that "" genius is insanity with some success "" , screenwriter fierstein is taking a lazy shortcut ) , pryce makes an agreeable , memorable villain .  in the future , they should pursue actors as talented and experienced as pryce to breathe life into these cardboard figures .  there a few too many explosions in "" tomorrow never dies "" , perhaps so many they qualify as dialogue .  and it could have used a sharper script , though i was amused by the double entendres , none of which i will reveal here .  as it stands , the plot suffers many holes ( i'm not taking about implausibilities ) , and the dialogue tends towards the hackneyed .  now that the elements are in place : modern special effects and stunt work , cool pierce brosnan , kickass female allies . . .  it's time to put them to use in something truly special .  there's no mistaking , however , that "" tomorrow never dies "" is ideal holiday escapism , and for the first time in perhaps years , you'll walk out wanting more bond movies .  -reviewed december 17 , 1997  "|-0.20000000000000004|0.8000000000000002|0.9|"The explanations suggest that the sentiment of the text leans slightly towards the negative side, with criticism of ""GoldenEye"" and some flaws in ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" but also highlight some positive aspects such as the entertaining nature of the film and Pierce Brosnan's performance as James Bond.
