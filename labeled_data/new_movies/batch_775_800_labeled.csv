1|"in these days of overlong movies ( meet joe black , the thin red line , the mask of zorro ) it is a shame that films like waking ned devine can't be longer than a paltry 90 minutes .  this is just a cute movie , even through its mildly risque subject matter .  old friends jackie ( bannen ) and michael ( kelley ) try to find the lottery winner ( they deduce must live in their dinky town of about 60 ) so that they might kiss up to him and share the winnings .  through process of elimination , they find that it must be lovable old ned devine , who they find sitting in front of his tv , clutching the winning lottery ticket in his cold dead hand .  what results is thuroughly amusing , as jackie tries to convince his wife that not claiming it would be wrong , and that they could really benefit .  after all , old ned won't miss it .  rather than divulge the later twists and turns , i'll stop here merely pointing out that jackie and michael get into all sorts of trouble in their little sleepy irish villiage .  bannen and kelly are a perfect pair .  one slightly stout , the other as thin as a rail .  both getting on in years , they make such a cute pair of old codgers .  waking ned devine may even be seen as a "" full monty "" for the geriatric set , especially since kelly gets buff-o for one amusing scene .  waking ned devine is by no means perfect , but it is so sincere and touching that it looks so much better than most films .  the performances by everyone in the town are great , particularly the two leads .  there is one twist at the end which i find unnecessary , but it hardly ruins the picture .  writer/director kirk jones should be held up as an example to all those hollywood screenwriters .  scripts as creative and endearing as this should be the norm , not the exception .  perhaps it makes us appreciate this wonderful film even more .  had i held off on my year's best/worst list for another day , waking ned devine ( officially released in late november of 98 ) surely would have graced the short group of the year's finest films .  it is light , but thought provoking and sweet .  i can't think of anyone who shouldn't see ( or wouldn't enjoy ) this film .

1|dark city is such a rare treat : it ? s a stunning , hyperkinetic vision of a place where our reality is fused with noir , science fiction and the darkest nights in manhattan and london .  to boot , it is accompanied by an intense , well written and thoughtful story .  movies of this caliber and idea aren ? t made too often , and it ? s unfortunate that i waited this long to see it .  alex proyas , who ? s previous film the crow looked good but couldn ? t cover up the terrible acting or story , here shows a near masterpiece ; a combination of metropolis , edward hopper and phillip marlowe , fused seemlessly .  at times it moves beyond film into artwork .  it is the story of ? strangers ? , aliens from another planet ( and we know they ? re aliens because they shave their heads and wear overcoats ? one of the detractions of the film ) who experiment on humans to discover what makes them live , what makes up our ? soul ? .  these aliens are superior to humans because they have mastered the ? ultimate technology ? of shaping matter with their mind , called ? tuning .  they are aided by a human scientist , played by kiefer sutherland , who has ? betrayed his kind ? and at the start of the film watches as the entire city stops at exactly midnight .  during this time , john murdoch , played swiftly by rufus sewell , wakes in a bathtub in a room with a swinging overhead light ( a terrific visual effect - not only is murdoch confused , but so is the audience ) .  without a memory and a strange guilt that he may be a killer , he receives a phone call to flee , as the strangers are after him .  i don ? t want to proceed to much further with the explanation of the story ; one of the pleasures of the film is watching it develop , in a way regaining murdoch ? s ? identity ? along with him .  it ? s a pleasure to watch the characters develop through the cinematography .  murdoch ? s wife , anna , is introduced through a stunning beam of light : she is a lounge singer who sings into a bright spotlight .  shadows , outlines of men in hats watch , as she gently curves through the shine .  we see the outline of her body from behind , an hourglass , as she sings a slow , rhythmic song .  a great entrance .  however , a film such as this is only successful if the morals and themes behind it are strong enough to leave the viewer satisfied .  the city is nice to look at , but if it ? s a poor story then it ? s not worth watching .  blade runner was popular not only because it ? s visuals , but it ? s story and themes were thought out and provoked strong response from the audience .  it is discussed it and argued , therefore a success .  other science fiction films of recent times , such as the fifth element , are nice to look at , but are dropped and forgotten because the cookie cutter moral behind them is so flimsy .  we ? re left with ? love conquers all ? after finishing the fifth element .  dark city is not so easily explained away .  as the strangers discovered , locating the human soul and discovering what makes us survive is not such an easy task .  where is reality ?  dark city is certainly the best science fiction film of the 90 ? s , and ranks along with the best made in the 80s , such as blade runner and the two aliens films .  perhaps it ? s the best of the both decades ; it had the darkness of the aliens films , as well as the visuals and compelling story of blade runner , but moved beyond , i think , because the themes behind it were much stronger .  anyone who wants to make an argument for better science fiction films please feel free to write , i ? d love to hear it .  |0.8833333333333333|0.9166666666666666|0.9333333333333332|"""Dark City"" is a highly praised science fiction film of the 90s with stunning visuals and a well-written, intense story that combines different influences and themes, making it a rare treat and near masterpiece in the genre."
1|"anyone who saw alan rickman's finely-realized performances in truly madly deeply and sense and sensibility will be unsurprised that the actor-turned-director is a bit of a poet at heart .  however , for those who recall him only as the maniacal villain of die hard and robin hood : prince of thieves , this recognition may be something of a shock .  nevertheless , "" poetic "" is an excellent term to describe rickman's feature debut as a director , the winter guest .  the film has a simple , unhurried rhythm that uses all of the available elements to fashion a successful whole .  the result is an occasionally haunting , sometimes magical , and always insightful human drama .  the winter guest isn't about resolving plot threads and advancing a story line ; it's about exploring relationships and examining life in all of its stages .  the winter guest does not tell a traditional tale , nor does it ascribe to a conventional narrative structure ? there is no real beginning or end .  instead , we are given an opportunity to observe one day in the lives of eight humans .  they represent both sexes , multiple generations , and a variety of relationships ? male and female ; young , middle-aged , and elderly ; friends , would-be lovers , and kin .  we see expectations fulfilled and disappointed , emotional boundaries eroded , and truths unveiled .  there is comedy and tragedy .  most importantly , much of what transpires during the course of the winter guest will find an echo in our own lives ? in this fiction can be found much truth .  the setting is small town in scotland on the coldest day of the year .  it's so frigid that the sea has begun to freeze over .  the onshore wind cuts like a knife and snow blankets the beach , giving the terrain an alien appearance .  it is against this backdrop that the relationships of the film are captured .  there are four pairings , and , although there is some interaction between the different twosomes , the winter guest's focus is on the dynamics internal to each relationship .  the first , meatiest pairing is that of elspeth ( phylida law ) and her recently-widowed daughter , frances ( emma thompson ) .  these two have a stormy relationship .  they love each other deeply , but both are stubborn and willful , and neither is willing to admit that they need the other .  much of their interaction is argumentative , but , during the course of a long walk to the frozen shoreline , they come to an unspoken understanding of how much each means to the other .  frances' adult son , alex ( gary hollywood ) , is a lonely young man who has been caring for his mother since the death of his father .  on this day , he meets a girl , nita ( arlene cockburn ) , who has secretly been spying on him for weeks .  although their first encounter is antagonistic ( she throws a snowball at him ) , both quickly become aware of an undeniable attraction .  once they retire to a place where they can be alone , however , things don't go exactly as planned .  lily ( sheila reid ) and chloe ( sandra voe ) are a couple of old friends who are frequent funeral attendees .  death is a topic of endless fascination for them , perhaps because they are so close to it , and they spend their spare time scanning the obituaries , looking for the next funeral or cremation in the area .  it doesn't matter whether or not they knew the deceased .  it's the ceremony that they're interested in .  sam ( douglas murphy ) and tom ( sean biggerstaff ) , a pair of schoolboy chums , are spending this cold february day cutting classes and hanging out at the beach , horsing around , building a small fire for warmth , and walking on the frozen water .  unlike lily and chloe , these two have their entire lives ahead of them .  they are young enough to still believe in magic , but old enough to recognize that the process of crossing into adulthood robs life of the simple joy that only children can experience .  the acting is strong and believable .  the mixture of veteran performers and first-timers is effective , with the most successful choice being the casting of real-life mother and daughter phylida law and emma thompson in the most prominent roles .  there is a chemistry in their interaction that would be hard to replicate with two different , non-related actors .  and , of course , the physical resemblance makes it that much easier to accept elspeth and frances as parent and child .  the winter guest began its life as a stage play in 1995 , with rickman as the director .  four of the film's principals , phylida law , arlene cockburn , sheila reid , and sandra voe , appeared in the theatrical version before moving to the film .  unlike several recent motion pictures adapted from plays , the winter guest has been successfully opened up .  the rough , bleak scottish countryside becomes as much of a character as any of the eight humans .  in fact , considering how important the climate is to every relationship under rickman's microscope , it could be argued that this is the single most important element of the movie .  if you appreciate character studies , the winter guest is a solid effort with enough power to stay with you after you have left the theater .

1|"i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean's war picture .  i still think that "" the bridge on the river kwai "" doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies .  and i think that "" 12 angry men "" , "" witness for the prosecution "" and "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957 .  but i can't deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents .  the film is set in burma in 1943 .  a batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai .  but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen .  struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect .  afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge .  he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese .  but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . .  a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people .  they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge .  and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory "" .  lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies .  this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito .  in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is presented as a somehow unpleasant person .  the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not .  the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men .   ( the plot by-passes these risks . )  that means , the picture isn't perfect .  but it has a lot of virtues as well .   "" the bridge on the river kwai "" shows the "" madness "" of war and what it can produce in people's minds .  it shows how colonel nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics .  and lean's film is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests .  these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) .  david lean's direction is really effective and atmospherically perfect .  his film is highly suspenseful , especially in its dramatic ( if not wholly plausible ) showdown .  the film is also well-photographed and has an apt score .  alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character .  the other actors deliver fine performances as well .  i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

1|"recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources .  each review compared this film to the truman show .  why ?  the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television .  other than that , the two movies are completely different from each other .  reviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i . e .  the truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies .  when pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman .  the same goes for the thin red line , as well .  when it opened in decemeber , probably 98% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg's saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever .  critics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards .  this is why i think pleasantville was underrated .  if the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it's long been on the video store shelves .  sure , it wasn't perfect , and it wasn't very believeable , but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars , and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history .  with the exception of don knotts as the annoying "" tv repairman "" the film is cast perfectly : the ice storm's tobey maguire is david in real life ; he watches the old 50's sitcom "" pleasantville "" to escape from his feuding parents .  his twin sister , jen ( reese witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotypically ) smokes and wears revealing clothes .  but what makes her character believeable is the dialogue-those excessive 90's terms such as "" like "" , "" whatever "" , and "" cool "" make her sound like the total dimwit she's supposed to be .  the twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo-esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote .  their new parents , played by william h . macy and joan allen , are perfect in every way .  their new names are bud and mary sue , and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville .  after the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles , the movie begins to take form .  it's just like watching a sitcom in itself ; you don't want it to end .   "" mary sue "" has sex with her date , the school basketball champion ; when he tells all his friends about it , they stop preforming perfectly at basketball , and things start to take color .  soon we learn that these people don't know how to express true emotions , and when they learn to do so , they eventually turn into color .  this eventually sparks a racial war between the "" coloreds "" and the "" black & whites . ""  entertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has , "" none of the depth , poignance , and brilliance of the truman show . . . ""  yes , the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent .  but the racial setting-intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom-certainly classifies as deep , considering it's what i least expected .  gary ross did not try to create an intelligent , award masterpiece-he just tries to convey moral messages within his work .  take for example big and dave , his past films .  big-be careful what you wish for .  dave-good or bad lying is still lying .  did these movies win big awards ?  no , but they won the heart of millions .  pleasantville could have done that too , if it wasn't for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films .  pleasantville : a- ad2am "" i almost lost my nose . . . and  i like it .  i like breathing through it .

1|"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  the teaser trailers for my best friend's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often .  it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend's wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts .  the heroine of my best friend's wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn't married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other .  both julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael's age , julianne realizes that he's mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day .  however , she finds herself even more distraught when michael's call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary .  the setup for my best friend's wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film's storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel's wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend's wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour .  the film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan .  for example , there's a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background .  my best friend's wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen's everyone says i love you ; i'd even assert it's a more successful one .  my best friend's wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well .  in a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy's life , she'd actually like her too .  the george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend's wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality .  throughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion .  there is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we're given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments .  my best friend's wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne .  this isn't the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character's neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable .  even better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend's weddding .  with a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy's insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film .  she even sings - i won't soon forget her charming serenade of "" i just don't know what to do with myself "" .  rupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film .  his george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett's performance is a delight to watch ; he's clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous .  dermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he's not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic .  when julia roberts' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as "" america's sweetheart "" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile .  while that didn't quite work out , it's near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game .  my best friend's wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan's reputation as a skilled director of comedy .

1|"robocop is an intelligent science fiction thriller and social satire , one with class and style .  the film , set in old detroit in the year 1991 , stars peter weller as murphy , a lieutenant on the city's police force .  1991's detroit suffers from rampant crime and a police department run by a private contractor ( security concepts inc . ) whose employees ( the cops ) are threatening to strike .  to make matters worse , a savage group of cop-killers has been terrorizing the city .  on murphy's first day of duty , after his transfer from another precinct , these cop-killers brutally murder him by shooting off his limbs one by one .   ( orion pictures had to edit this extremely graphic scene in order to get an r rating from the m . p . a . a . )  after the emergency room staff at the hospital cannot save murphy and declare him clinically dead , s . c . i .  recruits his remains for their new "" robocop "" program .  using the remains of murphy's body as a foundation , their scientists build a cyborg , made of both flesh and metal .  the cyborg ( robocop ) is half human ( murphy ) and half robot ; the s . c . i .  engineers have erased murphy's memory and replaced it with a computer program ( or so they think ) .  with his lightning quick reflexes , immense strength , and impenetrable armor , s . c . i .  envisions robocop as an indestructible super-cop : the solution to detroit's problems .  the remainder of the plot follows robocop's crime-foiling and vengeance on his murderers .  as a science fiction action-thriller , robocop is extremely effective .  dutch director paul verhoeven combines gritty action with suspense , shocking gore , and spectacular special effects .  several sequences in the film , such as the one in which robocop employs his extremely precise aim to stop a rapist , are destined to become cult-classics .  because robocop is so visually and emotionally rousing , it demands to be seen on a large screen with an audience--in other words , in a movie theater .  although the special effects and action are exciting , they do not by themselves set robocop apart from other films in the genre .  rather , robocop stands out for its accurate and biting satire of american society .  the movie makes a mockery of the star wars defense initiative , terrorism , board games , and television news broadcasts with air-headed anchors .  these news broadcasts , which are exceptionally clever , recur periodically throughout the movie and help to provide comic relief from the intense action and gore .  the satire in robocop , however , is almost as frightening in its own way as the suspense and blood .  1990's america , as portrayed in the film , may seem far fetched but is in actuality ( i think ) only a slight exaggeration of the current state of american society .  the humorous satire in robocop is simultaneously credible and absurd .  verhoeven adroitly balances the satirical comedy with the gory action to create an entertaining and enlightening piece of science fiction/social commentary .  unfortunately , robocop possesses several flaws which prevent it from qualifying as a classic within the genre .  the movie lacks the lasting impact of such films as the road warrior , the terminator , and aliens .  robocop's main problem , aside from its dumb title , is that it does not sufficiently develop murphy's character .  we never learn the degree to which murphy ( as robocop ) is human and the degree to which he is a robot .  does murphy have any human spirit or free will left , or is he merely a computer following a program ?  the script halfheartedly raises these issues but then abandons them in its climactic flurry of gory action .  moreover , it almost completely ignores the question ( and tragedy ) of denying a man his right to die in favor of turning him into a machine .  robocop also contains several bothersome loose-ends .  as you watch robocop , you experience deja vu ; you feel as if you have seen the film before .  in many respects , robocop is reminiscent of several other films , including the terminator , return of the jedi , and even death wish .  however , to its credit , robocop easily has enough originality and unique personality to avoid becoming a cheap rip-off .

"" .  and then the ship goes down and the few survivors are left alone under the stars and the chilling air .  however , the actual disaster is happening almost at the end of the movie , while the first two hours are just beautiful sets and bad dialogues .  in the present day , the rms titanic is explored by brock lovett ( bill paxton ) , a treasure seeker looking for the coeur de la mer diamond , lost during the sinking .  somewhere inside the ship , lovett's crew discover a sketchbook of an artist long dead .  here , in the shape of a nude young lady , is a window into the distant age of 1912 .  lovett is extremely surprised when he get's a phone call from rose dawson , claiming that she is a model .  she is immediately helicoptered onto the vessel , and she gets the first glimpse of the fated ship in 80 years .  as the memories come flooding back , she once again becomes rose dewitt buketer ( kate winslet ) , the fianc ? e of wealthy cal hockley ( billy zane ) and daughter of ruth dewitt bukater ( frances fisher ) .  on board there are rich and poor , everyone trust in the ship's designer ( jonathan hyde ) and her master , captain e . j .  smith ( bernard hill ) .  on board the ship , rose , unhappy and restless meets jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) - a young american artist , poor , brave and attractive .  a love story slowly emerges and the two lovers must not only experience the difference between the social classes , but also face the greatest power on earth - death .  cameron could as well have called his picture "" the never ending love "" or "" love at first sight "" , as he concentrates all his energy on the young couple , and not on the disaster itself .  the plot is anything but original and the dialogues sometimes resemble a television soap-opera .  the director doesn't even try to overcome his empty script .  because of its primitive and predictable plot , titanic is totally depending on the visuals that truly are breathtaking .  russel carpenter's rich , majestic and incredibly detailed cinematography is certainly award-worthy .  everything from art direction to visual and sound effects are a top notch .  but it doesn't help much when the costumes are more convincing than the actors who wear them .  the actors are not to blame , because their characters are more like caricatures , in other words - fake .  jack is a man with many talents : he is a talented artist , handsome , brave , honest , strong , funny . . . you  name it .  he doesn't have any dark side , he doesn't make any mistakes , that for a second would make him human .  jack is perfect , but he is - poor .  on the other hand we have cal .  he is a bastard that treats rose as an odalisque and not as his wife-to-be .  he lacks everything jack possesses , but he is -- rich .  this childish contrast between the social classes is one of those things that makes titanic nothing more than a mediocre picture .  cameron knows precisely what we want to see .  his film therefore contains certain minimums to draw an audience - attractive actors , a "" tragic love story "" , beautiful visuals ( including expensive special effects ) , a dose of social criticism , a fascinating historical event ( we love true stories ) and last , but not least - an incredible media support , which proclaimed an average picture the "" greatest film of all time "" .  on the outside titanic looks perfect , but behind that sparkling curtain of incredible visuals - is emptiness - nothing to think about .  the main weakness of this film , which ironically became its success , is simplicity .  cameron enables our basic and if you wish - primitive emotions : love , hate , fear and helplessness .  everyone understands the power of love and the threat to our beautiful couple is likewise imaginable - a sinking ship .  titanic is a typical hollywood production , totally and completely dependent on visual perfection to hide its primitive plot .  it's a good picture , but absolutely not a masterpiece .  it's among hundreds and thousands good films released every year , not better or worse than the average american film .

1|cinema has been around for about a hundred years now . ?  it's not my job to recap this century every time i talk about a new film , but i'd like to think that i'm beginning to understand the art more as i watch more films from before my time .  recently , i've seen the films of hitchcock , capra , fellini , godard , kurosawa , chaplin , lang , and many others .   ? those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius . ?  they are likely to be remembered for .   .   .  well , quite a while . ?  i like this film , too . ?  yes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie . ?  true , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime . ?  and there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money . ?  in fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable .  i certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through .  of course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together .  the story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters .  yes , you read that right .  armageddon actually has characters you can care about !  if you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be .  if you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story .  it turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film .  so , it's up to the u . s . government to stop it .   ( why the u . s . is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . )  their plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within .  the head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) .  his group of men is a colorful bunch , including a . j .   ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) .  there's also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter .  a . j .  and grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation .  it's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon .  it's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff .  it's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens .  but bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better .  i think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles .  take the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york .  a meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars .  the action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways .  i like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch .  it's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times .  but it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes .  the special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame .  deep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable .  special effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work .  everything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid .  the effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art .  of course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action .  the film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action .  much of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots .  i won't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way .  in fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story .  bruce willis is terrific , and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) .  tyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level .  patton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving .  the comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny .  i wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much .  but the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do .  it's not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema .  it might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget .  i'm not saying that films like this are risky moves .  what i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms .  |0.5333333333333333|0.7666666666666666|0.9|"The overall sentiment is positive, with the author appreciating classic films and praising the direction, story, and characters in ""Armageddon,"" including the visually stunning special effects.

1|it's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office .  a poorly-written script can be bested by a superb acting corps , and a well-written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs .  in directing his latest action-comedy , director brett ratner ( money talks ) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get-out buddy cop movie .  in addition , rush hour serves as a first-class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude - a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types .  the two lead names share equal screen time here , mostly because they spend it together .  jackie chan , in his first completely american production , makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts .  the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago , knock off , stands no chance against the content of this one .  chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise , and there's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who couldn't believe their eyes the first time .  chris tucker , on the opposite side , relates a hilarious comedic approach which smoothes out the rough edges to chan's performance .  he works perfectly with the script , and it's quite likely he lent scribe jim kouf a hand with some of his lines .  almost essential to the action genre , the plot is nonexistent .  we're quickly introduced to detective james carter ( tucker ) is a maverick officer for the lapd .  cut forward to another scene where the daughter ( julia hsu ) of the american chinese consul ( tzi ma ) is kidnapped by a gang of swarthy characters .  the fbi is quick to the rescue , but the consul insists that one of his men , detective inspector lee ( chan ) , be brought on the case to help .  the fbi resists , but then requests that lapd send a man over to babysit the chinese detective .  it's here that carter and lee hook up , and the two unwittingly solve the case while the fbi rushes in to back them up .  rattner does a fine job of going the extra mile to get his movie to move a step up , but it doesn't quite reach the top tier of action-comedies like last year's grosse pointe blank .  there are moments where the plot strays too far off the straight line it sticks almost exclusively to , and if not for the comedic interactions between tucker and chan , this might be a major drawback .  also , some supporting characters are almost entirely along for the ride , and others are there simply to look menacing .  however , none gives a standoffish performance and they mostly mesh into the background .  almost every member of the cast displays some reservation at one point or another - whether it's tucker's toned-down routine or chan's tight rein on his action sequences - and that contributes greatly to this being a watchable movie for all types .  a recommendable visit to the theater , indeed .  |0.6926666666666668|0.8666666666666667|0.9|The sentiment of the text is positive, as reviewers praise the director's ability to turn a mediocre script into a funny buddy cop movie, highlight the impressive performances of Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker, and mention that the movie is watchable and recommendable for all types of audiences.
1|"when andy leaves for cowboy camp , his mother holds a yard sale and scrounges in his room for old toys .  one of these toys is wheezy , a penguin with a broken squeaker .  woody ( tom hanks ) saddles up andy's dog and rides out into the yard to rescue wheezy .  woody succeeds in his mission , but doesn't make it back to the house before al , the unscrupulous owner of al's toy barn , recognizes woody as a rare collector's item and steals him .  buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) leads hamm ( john ratzenberger ) , mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , slinky dog ( jim varney ) , and rex ( wallace shawn ) into the city to find their friend .  meanwhile woody discovers the reason he was kidnapped .  al has collected every piece of merchandising from the 1950's tv puppet show "" woody's round-up "" except for a woody doll .  now that the collection is complete , al plans to sell woody and his round-up gang-bullseye the horse , jessie the cowgirl ( joan cusack ) , and stinky pete the old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) -to a toy museum in japan .  the gang is happy about the move ; they've been in storage for years waiting for woody .  if woody doesn't go with them , they'll be closed up in a dark box again , possibly forever .  trying to convince him to stay with them , jessie tells woody how she was abandoned when her owner grew up , and woody realizes that his days as a beloved toy are numbered .  while woody ponders whether to go to japan or to go home to andy , buzz and the boys invade al's toy barn , where the buzz we know is replaced by another buzz who doesn't know he's a toy .  the new buzz generates the movie's biggest laughs as he leads the other toys in an assault on "" zurg's fortress "" ( i . e . , al's apartment building ) .  the original "" toy story "" won me over because its central themes reflected a grown-up sensibility rather than the usual this-is-what-we-think-kids-want-to-hear .  while most kids' movies take the position that every person is special and has an extraordinary destiny to fulfill , in "" toy story "" buzz discovered that he wasn't special , that he was just like everyone else .  buzz sank into a suicidal depression , but woody showed buzz that being a toy was worthwhile because a toy is loved and a toy makes a child happy .  in other words , it's okay to be ordinary if you have love and a purpose in your life .  most of us probably come to the same conclusion when we realize that we're not space rangers and we're never going to be .   "" toy story 2 "" addresses the question raised by the conclusion drawn by the first movie .  woody is forced to recognize that andy will grow up and forget him and that he will likely be discarded , abandoned , or sealed up in a dark box in the attic .  this is another big grown-up theme : everything ends .  the theme is introduced early in the movie when woody's arm is torn and andy places him on a shelf rather than taking him to cowboy camp .  on the shelf , woody meets wheezy , who's dusty , broken , and forgotten .  the other toys are shocked that woody has been "" shelved , "" and they worry that woody's ride out to the 25-cent box at the yard sale is a suicide attempt .  after he's stolen , woody has to decide between a long life in a display case and an uncertain future with andy and his pals .  of course , in spite of the heavy themes "" toy story 2 "" explores , it's also very funny .  most of the laughs come from the toys' assault on al's toy barn and on the apartment building .  the brief substitution of a new , still delusional buzz was a welcome surprise ; i'd wondered how a sequel could be as funny as the original without the pompous attitude buzz displayed in the original .  most of the vocal performances are first-rate .  tom hanks stands out for the level of enthusiasm he puts into his work .  however , one voice-over also stands out as horribly miscast .  kelsey grammer sounds nothing like an old prospector .  although he does a lot of voice-over work in commercials and on "" the simpsons "" ( as sideshow bob ) , grammer only makes slight variations on his own voice .  he doesn't have the range to pull off a role like stinky pete .  the animation is even better than in the first .  especially impressive were the textures of the figures .  we can now see the difference between flesh and plastic ; in the first movie the people looked just like the toys , but now human skin looks soft and has a slight bluish tint .  we can also see that bo peep is porcelain .  as you can tell from the long-winded phrasing common in the merchandising -- "" disney and pixar's 'toy story 2' "" -- this is pixar's coming out party .  to celebrate they appended their first project , a hilarious short about two desklamps and a rubber ball , to the beginning of the movie .  they made the short in 1986 , which is incredible when one considers the relatively primitive level of computer technology available then .  on the downside , "" toy story 2 "" follows the formula of the original so closely that the sequel comes off a bit stale , and some sections tend to drag .  overall , though , i had a great time and found "" story 2 "" to be a worthy successor to the first "" toy story .

1|"david lynch's "" blue velvet "" begins and ends with colorful , bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seemingly perfect american town .  however , what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a "" strange world "" of drug dealers , sadists , and murderers .  the opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy , disturbing film .  they show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances .  odd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film , its characters , its direction , and its story .  thankfully , the obscurity that "" blue velvet "" relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable .  since its elements are so originally weird , you never know what will happen next .  this is the main goal of a movie ; to be spontaneous and surprising .   "" blue velvet "" miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting .  lynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling .  the film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy ( kyle maclachlan ) .  from this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer ( isabella rossellinia ) who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping .  the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch's story telling so amazing .  maclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship , in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick , and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends .  through these multiple stories , maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan , we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots .  lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion .  instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times .  lynch has been known to do this with a number of his films meaning he may be too esoteric for some hoping to get a hollywood ending where the good guy gets the girl and everything turns out fine .  however , for fans of odd difficult indies , "" blue velvet "" could be just what they are looking for .  it is very hard to discuss "" blue velvet "" without discussing the performance of dennis hopper's sadistic frank .  most of the other actors in the film were not very memorable .  kyle maclachlan lacked one important aspect for his role , a personality .  laura dern was consistently annoying .  but dennis hopper stole every scene he was in .  his evil character was just plain old frightening in his mannerisms from his obsession to velvet to his incessant breathing from a gas mask .  frank is a character that comes along once in a blue moon .  many producers know this and have inevitably begun to typecast hopper as the bad guy .  just like his villain in "" speed "" , hopper is over the edge with cursing and screaming every chance he has to speak .  this harshness is exactly what frank is , so weird and twisted that it is hard not to look at him , even if he theatens you to look away .   "" blue velvet "" has characters and stories you will never see in a movie again .  for this sole reason it is recommended .  but also see it to admire lynch's obsession to avoid the norm .  even if this film is a little too weird for you , it's hard not to congratulate a guy for trying something new and sticking to it .

1|"tempe mills cinema , az--this movie had us in non-stop stitches from beginning to end .  all those promotional clips that have been on tv for the past month came from the first five minutes of the movie .  if you thought they were funny , see the rest of the movie .  it's hilarious .  how does one go about making a movie about a couple guys whose only claim to fame is synchronized head-bopping on snl to exactly one song ?  easy .  write an interesting script around tried-and-true ideas , add some good lines and satire , and voil ? , you end up with an excellent , well-done , very entertaining flick .  will and chris are idiot brothers forced by their father to work begrudgingly in the family flower business during the day .  at night they pursue their life-long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills , ca , the only disco act worth going to .  the only problem , the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door , the roxbury closes , all the while bearing witness to guys with one-hundred-dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss .  the script authors ( steve koren , will ferrell and chris kattan ) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury .  their flower-shop van is rear-ended by richard grieco , who fears a law-suit and is surprised to see the idiots are too star-struck to think about the car accident they just had , but not about getting into the roxbury .  grieco happily takes them in , even introduces them to the owner , which has the added benefit of enhancing the financial appearance of the idiot brothers in the eyes of a couple of gold diggers ( elisa donovan and gigi rice ) who bet their time and bodies on will and chris .  what follows are some of the best slap-stick dancing routines ever .  the music is superb , and could have only been made better had the producers added patrick hernandez's born to be alive .  the choreography at times was a parody of an era gone by , for example , the bee gees and their stayin' alive .  it is nostalgic for those of us who remember that far back , and the technique is a clever adaptation that worked well in forest gump .  one of the funniest scenes is when the gold diggers discover that will  and chris don't have any mone y , and dump both on the spot , even expressing violence and anger that they gave sex away .  an art-imitates-life poke at shallow women .  it's a scene that's an approximate parody of the vinegar's own rolf luedeke's editorial this week national organization for men ( nom ) replaces now .  ted "" unabomber ""  kaczynski , himself rejected for not having money , will identify well with this scene , if he ever watches the movie .  of course , the script wouldn't be complicated enough without adding molly shannon , the girl next door who has had a crush on will since they were kids , and who will has had an aversion to in quest of good-looking disco blondes ( proof that men will turn down perfectly good women when there are bay watch babes always lurking nearby ) .  nevertheless , will's father wants him to marry molly anyway , but thinks idiot chris is standing in the way and sends him into guest-quarter exile .  during the wedding ceremony , will's heart isn't exactly into getting married , and when his brother appears on the balcony with a ghetto blaster and more head-bopping music , will thinks worse of the knot-tieing idea and runs to chris .  definitely an snl parody of the graduate where katharine ross changed her mind for the screaming dustin hoffman in the church balcony .  i found this scene a riot , however , it went over brandi's head -- she was born seven years after the graduate first appeared .  the scene has a good punch line when molly shannon marries , instead , the step-in buddy/weight-lifter ( who looks like he could pass for the son of gary busy ) and who has been lusting for a good-looker for a long time , but ready now to take anyone .  more art-imitates-life stuff -- not even muscles can substitute for money in the real world .  the idiots' mother is played by loni anderson , whose barbie-doll looks  don't play well anymore ( she's a bit old ) , and whose cleavage looks like someone botched a tracheotomy too low down .  i recommend this movie for anyone who wants to have a lot of fun or in  need of a lot of laughs .  go with a date .  brandi laughed non-stop , as i  did , and a deaf-mute might have concluded i was tickling her continuously for 105 minutes .  "|0.7536666666666667|0.8250000000000001|0.9166666666666666|The movie is highly praised for its hilarious and entertaining aspects, with the reviewer emphasizing its non-stop laughter and recommending it for a fun-filled experience.
1|"there is nothing like american history x in theaters or on video .  no other feature film takes such a cold hard look at the lure , the culture , and the brotherhood of white supremacy .  nice guy ed norton jr . ( who sang in everyone says i love you ) plays derek , a twenty-year old skinhead .  dad's subtle racism grew large in derek , after gang members killed his father .  dad was fighting a fire when they shot him .  now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart .  derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence .  at a basketball court , black and white tempers flare .  derek channels the aggression into a game , black versus white , for ownership of the courts .  when the choice presents itself , derek goes for game point instead of the sucker-punch .  cameron ( stacy keach ) steps in to derek's life as a surrogate father .  he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings .  keeping his own criminal record spotless , he uses derek as a leader and organizer for high-visibility racial intimidation .  derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race-motivated mob crimes .  at the bottom of the chain , derek's younger brother danny ( edward furlong , made famous in terminator 2 ) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons , but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong .  one night three black youths break into derek's truck , which is exactly what derek has been waiting for .  outside in his shorts and his tattoo , he shoots them all .  the third would-be thief , unarmed , is only wounded .  in the key scene of the film , derek commands the kid into a position where he can be killed with one glorious , enraptured , awful stomp .   ( the fun-spoiling nc-17 of orgazmo seems even more inappropriate , considering american history x was rated r . what sort of country is this that says sex comedies are a bigger threat to our youth than brutal , ecstatic violence ? )  the police arrive just as derek kills the last thief .  derek does not resist the cops , and as they spin him around to cuff him , the film slows down .  derek raises his eyebrows and smiles at his little brother in a chilling , sadistic , satisfied grin .  now in prison , derek faces new challenges .  as the black man in the laundry tells him , "" in the joint , you the nigra , not me . ""  there is a clique of swastika-wearing skinheads , but they are not interested in the ideology of white supremacy .  they only use the symbols as a means of intimidation .  derek finds himself truly alone , truly in danger , and truly afraid .  when derek finally gets out of prison , he finds that his friends from the gang have also changed .  without derek's leadership , they have shunned the white supremacist ideology for the white supremacist culture .  it is the final factor that makes him realize how badly he's screwed up .  in the end , he spends quality time with is brother trying to undo the respect and admiration he had earlier inspired in danny .  the film ends a little too deliberately , too neatly after the unchained emotion and violent glee of the rest of the film , but it barely detracts from the overall experience .  edward norton gives an oscar-worthy performance .  although some of his dialogue seemed to be written without enough conviction , norton's performance compensated .   ( an example that comes to mind is his pep talk before looting the store . )  he also captured the essence of an older brother .  he took his responsibility as a role model to his younger brother very seriously , very lovingly , both before and after his change of heart .  though clearly not for all tastes , this film is bold and daring .  the subject matter is ugly , cruel , and at times hard to look at .  nevertheless its subjects are part of humanity's great face .  kaye gives us a good look at this fascinating , if distasteful , american subculture .

1|"john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel .  you send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information .  it may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn't require a magical faster-than-light drive .  in the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned .  about thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda .  afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer's analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication .  she was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie .  audience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings .  dennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl .  feldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model .  now , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases .  species features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist .  forest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script .  the species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years .   ( note that , in the 1970's , we really didn't know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings .  even today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don't have it analyzed yet . )  the answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt .  the script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms .  the first half of the film has something to offer , as "" sil , "" the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos .  she seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be .  her instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area .  escaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her .  she goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re-creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 .  the pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin/exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath/psychic , just as though the u . s . government actually had such people on call .  neither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided .  whitaker's role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation's "" counselor cleavage . ""  the other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina .  kingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak .  h . r . giger's design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly .  the main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then doesn't live up to it .  all we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in .  there is no buildup of tension and suspense , no climax worthy of the name ; species is just a sequence of "" scare "" scenes stuck together .  the movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes , but not rescued by them .  on the other hand , as an exercise in sci-fi action/ adventure , it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd .  species earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board , but by and large , it's fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing .  my personal rating is three stars , but knock one or two of those off if you don't enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters .  mpaa classification : r ( violence , gore , nudity , sex , language )  stars : ben kingsley , michael madsen , forest whitaker , alfred molina , marg helgenberger , natasha henstridge directed by : roger donaldson produced by : frank mancuso jr . and dennis feldman typed by : dennis feldman cinematography : andrzej bartkowiak music : christopher young run time : 108 minutes aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 from mgm , opens 7 july 1995  "|0.10183332761128744|0.8333333333333334|0.8166666666666668|"The explanations overall suggest a slightly positive sentiment towards the text, highlighting its discussion of advancements in cosmic exploration, potential for communication with aliens, and positive audience response to certain shows.

""  the answer from my point of view is "" no "" .  braveheart was a truly gritty , and , one would imagine , realistic battle film .  ryan is ten times worse .  expect disembowelments , sucked in skulls , heads blown to bits , arms and legs flying across the battlefield .  many in the theater could not bear to watch .  and it is a shame , too , because this is otherwise by far one of the standouts this year .  but such graphic displays may turn away even the most loyal spielberg supporters ( and academy members ) .  saving private ryan takes us from the attack at omaha beach on d-day , 1944 , through into the film's primary mission .  captain miller ( hanks ) assembles an 8 man crew and sets off to find a missing solider , private ryan , whose three brothers have already been killed on the battlefield .  the government goes to great lengths to make sure that mrs . ryan doesn't recieve a fourth letter of condolences about her sons , that no person should suffer such injustice .  miller's crew is not in favor of the mission and they begin to harbor a secret hatred for ryan , though they don't yet know him .  they resent having to trudge out to bring home one soldier who doesn't have any more or less right to live than any of them .  this film manages to keep up a rapid pace and , though there is a lot of set up between battles , the story continues full speed to the end .  the pacing and dramatism of the extremely well choreographed battle scenes is really in a league of it's own .  spielberg , though not a student of the "" quick cut "" school of filmmaking , takes a stab at it here , and does it better than michael bay or any of his mtv counterparts could ever hope to do it .  bay should pay close attention , take copious notes .  if you want to jump cut every two seconds , do it the way spielberg does it in ryan .  in the end , the extremity of the gory violence is not justified by the "" importance "" of the film .  schindler's list taught many people the truth about the holocaust .  it opened eyes , sparked debate and study .  though the battle scenes in ryan have never been portrayed as realistically before , they don't amount to anything as serious or thought provoking as the schindler's list .  overall , this is just the truest depiction of the old adage , "" war is hell .

1|" "" the faculty , "" the heavily-hyped and advertised sci-fi/horror film that has teamed up director robert rodriguez ( 1995's "" desperado "" and 1996's "" from dusk till dawn "" ) and screenwriter kevin williamson ( 1996's "" scream "" and 1997's "" scream 2 "" ) , is being called a cross between "" invasion of the body snatchers "" and "" the breakfast club , "" and i don't think i could describe it any better than that .  the film sets up the six central teenage characters who do not seem to have much in common , and then the science-fiction aspect is added , involving the fear that the faculty at herrington high school are actually aliens who are quickly transforming everyone in the town .  the six characters , as in "" the breakfast club , "" can be easily labeled as a stereotype , but as they are developed , they become far more complex : casey ( elijah wood ) , the much picked upon nerd ; stokely ( clea duvall ) , a goth outcast who hides behind the false facade of being a lesbian so everyone will avoid her ; zeke ( josh hartnett ) , a drug dealer who turns out to be a science whiz ; stan ( shawn hatosy ) , the star football quarterback who is considering quitting the team to concentrate more on academics ; delilah ( jordanna brewster ) , the popular cheerleader and newspaper journalist ; and marybeth ( laura harris ) , the sweet 'n southern new girl in town .  although the characters are only slightly connected ( i . e .  casey is delilah's photojournalist assistant ; marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don't have friends , etc . ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren't really even sure if they can trust one another .   "" the faculty "" is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original "" scream , "" and rodriguez , whose "" from dusk till dawn "" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90's .  williamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no-brainer .  the plotline of "" the faculty , "" involving aliens taking over other people's bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from "" invasion of the body snatchers , "" to "" the puppet masters , "" to "" invaders from mars , "" so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings-on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful .  surely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren't .  the epilogue was also a refreshing change-of-pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better .  the performances in "" the faculty "" were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do .  one exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well-known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster .  as members of the faculty , robert patrick ( "" t2 : judgement day "" ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role .  the standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell .  if there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence .  since the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the "" queen "" alien , many of the faculty members disappear .  it might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget .  although not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , "" the faculty "" is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released .  while the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren't human .  and by putting this idea in the setting of a small-town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers .  + note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters .  in actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan's buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team .  if i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving .

1|"the central focus of michael winterbottom's "" welcome to sarajevo "" is sarajevo itself , the city under siege , and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there .  it proves the backdrop for a stunningly realized story which refreshingly strays from mythic portents ( "" platoon "" ) , racial tumultuosness ( the risible "" the walking dead "" ) or a tinge of schmaltziness ( "" schindler's list "" ) .  the two leads , stephen dillane as a reporter and emira nusevic as an orphan with a plight few can identify with , are extremely believable ; not one moment with them involved rings false .  the question is not what went right .  the question is what went wrong .  for one , the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses ( the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs , and that's about it . ) .  the assortment of high-profile supporting actors , ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter "" into "" liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children's aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters , albeit they strive .  the interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film , it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison .  still , winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy , frantic editing and imaginative use of music .  and it's a plus , because he doesn't toy with our emotions with sentimental blandness .  he wants us to know that in war , no one is victorious .  the sweet hereafter  starring ian holm , sarah polley , bruce greenwood , tom mccamus , gabrielle rose , arsinee khanjian , alberta watson , maury chaykin , caerthan banks .  produced by atom egoyan and camelia frieberg .  script by atom egoyan ( based on the novel by russell banks ) .  directed by atom egoyan .  running time : 110 mins .  rated r . __________________________________________________________  atom egoyan's powerfully meditative "" the sweet hereafter "" is as anything as haunting and transcendental as i've seen this year .  it not only explores the aftermaths of a terrible tragedy with magnificent subtlety , with cold , and stunning shots of the backdrop of this mistfortune but also by telegraphing the sense of devastation that has permeated the small town with an enormous amount of dignity and respect for each and every soul affected .  ian holm as the somber , lonely lawyer seeking compensation for the townspeople , has a decency and a restraint uncommon with lawyers , he's a lion for the wrong reasons : the pain for having lost his daughter ( she's a druggie who frequently calls him begging for money ) is reflected on the town .  and in some mesmerizing flashbacks , we witness how she lost her purity .  it's one of the most strikingly breathtaking takes on the loss of innocence i've ever seen .  but the most astounding part goes to sarah polly , the peaceful , benevolent girl who , in contrast to the other characters , remains the most mentally stable during past , present or future .  her ability to convey concealed pain and unconditional love is the opposite , yet near-revolutionary role that won emily watson an oscar nomination for "" breaking the waves "" .  both women are torn apart by an extraordinary incident but it is only then that we truly see , truly feel , their wordless , omnipotent love .

1|"after the average mouse hunt , the silly small soldiers and the entertaining antz , dreamworks try again with the children's film market with this stunning adaptation of the moses story .  as the film warns us at the beginning , it's not the full story , and some liberties have been taken , but generally this the bible story we all know and love , featuring burning bushes , the plagues and the parting of the red sea .  the only thing missing is charlton heston .  instead , we get val kilmer voicing moses , an hebrew who is placed in a river by his mother and rescued by the queen of egypt ( helen mirren . )  we flash forward several years to see moses and brother rameses ( fiennes ) all grown up .  moses soon finds out from brother and sister miriam and aaron ( sandra bullock and jeff goldblum ) that he isn't really the son of the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) and that it his destiny to free the hebrews from the egyptians tyrannical rule .  he soon sets about this , along with his wife tzipporah ( michelle pfeiffer . )  rameses and his two wizard friends ( voiced by steve martin and martin short ) try to stop moses completing his task .  while the plot is familiar and somewhat exciting for adults , for children reared on aladdin and hercules , this film could be the most godawful thing they've ever seen .  gone is the quick fire humour and standard , easy to follow plot .  but , spectacularly , and to dreamworks credit , nearly every child in the audience was captivated by the story and events happening on screen .  jeffrey katzenberg , who produced this film , certainly knows how to keep a child interested .  he's included some songs in the film , plus some comedy , and a exciting chariot chase , to keep the children interested .  and somehow , himself and the directors still manage to get all the drama and intensity of the story across , without ever being boring .  it's a remarkable achievement .  also remarkable is the animation , which puts hercules , an almost 'slap dash' effort , to shame .  relying on hand drawn and computer animation , the backgrounds and characters are amazingly detailed .  the film seems a little caught up with it's amazing visuals by showing a lot of sweeping visuals and 'moving' shots , but they _do_ look incredible .  the final 'plague' where god kills every first born child , and the parting of the red sea have to be seen to be believed .  kudos to the animators .  the vocal talent is also very good .  val kilmer does a fine job as moses ( although he doesn't sing ) and ralph fiennes is superb as rameses ( and he _does_ sing . )  sandra bullock and jeff goldblum are great , and steve martin and martin short are very good , but not in the film long enough .  finally , michelle pfeiffer does excellent work as moses wife .  kudos also goes to the voice of god , who instead of booming and bombastic is quiet and subdued .  sadly , he is uncredited , and i couldn't quite work out who the voice was .   ( but e-mail if you do . )  the songs are good , ranging from the usual love sonnets to the traditional big production number .  they don't disturb the movie , and while not particularly memorable , they are nice to listen to ( they're well sung aswell . )  the musical score is suitably epic , with some beautiful tunes .  coupled with the superb visuals , the prince of egypt is a visual and aural treat , backed up with a great story .  entertaining both for kids and adults , this film is a must see .  a david wilcock review ? 1998   "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes  "|0.7166666666666667|0.8333333333333334|0.85|Overall, the reviewers have positive sentiments towards the film, praising the stunning animation, captivating story, talented voice cast, and the film's ability to engage both children and adults. The only minor criticism mentioned is that it may not be as enjoyable for children accustomed to quicker humor and simpler plots.

1|"fritz lang's first american film since leaving nazi germany , is an eye-opener about a lynch mob in a small town .  joe wilson ( spencer tracy ) is a regular joe , a hard-working stiff , a decent guy , who is living with his two brothers , tom ( walcott ) and charlie ( albertson ) , in chicago .  he is engaged to katherine grant ( sylvia sidney ) , but can't save up enough money to marry her .  she takes the train west for a better paying job as a teacher .  before she departs , she gives him the wedding ring her father gave to her mother , sews up his ripped trench coat , corrects him when he mistakingly says the wrong word for memento , and kisses him goodbye .  a year goes by and joe buys a car and tells katherine that he will meet her to get married in capitol city , that he has quit his job and hopes to open a gas station .  driving through the rural backroads and camping out at night while going to met her , he arrives at a near-by town called strand .  but the deputy sheriff "" buggs "" meyers ( walter brennan ) comes upon him waving a shotgun and arrests him .  he accuses him of the kidnapping of a little girl .  the sheriff ( ellis ) finds salted peanuts on him just like the kidnapper had in his pocket , he also has a five dollar bill on him that matches one of the numbers of the ransom money , and he fits the general description of the suspect .  locked in jail , he waits for the district attorney to look at his claim of innocence .  in the local bar , the town citizens go into a rage when learning that an arrest has been made in the kidnapping .  fueled by angry talk about getting back at the kidnapper and of having the deputy inadvertently telling them of the ransom money found on the suspect , a mob storms the jail , burns it down and dynamites it when they can't get through to the prisoner's jail cell .  the sheriff called the governor for the national guard , but one of his political advisers countermanded that request , saying it wouldn't look right for the governor in an election year to call out troops for those he wants to vote for him .  somehow joe escapes , but his dog rainbow dies .  katherine hears what has happened on the radio and rushes to the neighboring town of strand only to see him engulfed by flames in his cell , and becomes convinced that he died .  the next day the newspapers announce that the guilty kidnapper confesses .  joe makes his way back to chicago and tells his brothers , who are startled to see him alive , that he wants revenge .  he thereby supplies his brothers with the names of the 22 leaders in the lynch mob .  an ambitious district attorney ( walter abel ) prosecutes the 22 for murder .  katherine , not knowing he's alive , remains in a state of shock , but is asked to be a witness that she saw joe burning to death .  the defense claims that it can't be a charge of murder without a corpse .  the trial proves to be interesting , as the citizens in this close-knit , respectable community , lie under oath , providing alibis for each other to prove they couldn't have been at the jail .  the sheriff also lies , saying he can't identify anyone in the mob .  but proof comes by way of a newsreel cameraman who caught the whole incident on film .  as for proof of the corpse , an anonymous letter is addressed to the judge enclosed with the wedding ring katherine gave joe .  in the note , memento is misspelled , which makes katherine realize that joe is alive .  when the sentence is announced , 20 of the accused are found guilty of murder , but joe marches into the courtroom and gives a pious speech about what happened .  katherine forgives him , and this very strong film ends on a weaker note than i think it should have .  but don't blame lang for all the changes in the film , of trying to take the town off the hook by introducing this wild revenge motive .  mgm couldn't bear to have it made the way lang wanted it , that is , by having tracy die in the lynching .  instead they wanted to stop short of condemning so many small american towns where lynchings actually do occur , and they thereby meddled throughout the entire script .  to lang's credit , even if this film failed to be a masterpiece because of the interference , it still did not let the good citizens off the moral hook .  his portrayal of the attempted lynching was powerfully done and was not compromised .  you couldn't help get the feeling that the citizens didn't care that much that they almost lynched an innocent man , but cared more about protecting the reputation of their town and would do anything to keep their 22 vigilantes from going to jail , even perjuring themselves .  their reaction to seeing joe alive was satisfying only in that it meant they weren't going to be convicted .  lang by no means implies that the town has learned its lesson from this incident .  he does imply that a dark side to joe wilson has been exposed , and the innocent , jovial good-guy , seen in the beginning of the film , has been largely altered forever by this traumatic experience .

1|veteran actor clint eastwood has never looked as grizzled as he does in true crime , his latest directorial effort .  when steve everett ( his newest character ) gets angry at someone , he glares them down with those famous dirty harry eyes , furrows his brow and frowns like a grizzly bear who's just lost his cubs .  eastwood has played some particularly despicable characters in his time , but everett could just take the cake .  he gets my vote , at least , partly because `ev' is a drunken affair-a-week womanizer who has many relationship problems , very few of which are with his wife ( diane venora ) .  when his colleague at the oakland tribune is in an ugly car wreck and dies , everett must take over for her at a vital interview session .  the interview is with frank beacham ( isaiah washington ) , a death-row inmate set to die at midnight for the murder of a pregnant convenience store clerk .  eastwood furrows his brow .  as everett gradually finds information , he realizes that beacham could very well be innocent .  he interviews a key witness ( michael jeter ) , who claims that he burst in the door at pocum's foods because his car had overheated , only to see beacham standing over the dead woman's body , blood on his suspenders , gun in hand .  but everett protests : how could he have seen the gun , which was lowered by his side , with the potato chip rack in front of him ?  jeter doesn't know what he's talking about .  eastwood furrows his brow .  crinkled expressions and all , clint is the centre of energy of true crime .  the film is by no means a standard action/suspense yarn , but a thoughtful human story in which the characters come before the shoot-outs .  isaiah washington has a break-out performance as frank beacham , and scenes with him and his weary wife ( lisa gay hamilton ) are truly heartfelt moments .  but the best scenes are ones that feature eastwood duking it out with those in authority over him .  denis leary , as everett's editor and boss , has more than a few memorable moments of restrained anger ( you see , ev is sleeping with his wife ) .  but hands down , the most enjoyable segments of the film are when james woods is on camera .  playing the big boss alan mann , woods and eastwood create amusing chemistry and laugh-out-loud punchlines .  when true crime opts for a high-speed chase to the governer's house at the finale , the quality of film-making takes an abrupt nosedive .  eastwood was so successful with colorful character portraits that he didn't need to switch lanes .  true crime is a tension-building , intriguing drama showcase for the talented director and star .  this is a road block he could have easily dismissed ( i furrow my brow ) .   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  |0.2333333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.7333333333333334|The sentiment of the text is slightly positive with praise for Clint Eastwood's performance and the performances of other actors, as well as appreciation for the tension-building and intriguing nature of the film.
