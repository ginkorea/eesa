1|"james cmaeron's breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok .  for those of you who do not know the plot : in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race .  human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed .  however , some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor .  to stop connor , the machines send a terminator ( arnold schwarzenegger ) back to 1984 to murder connor's mother , sara ( linda hamilton ) , and thus prevent connor from ever being born .  in response , the humans send a protector , kyle reese , played by michael biehn .  images of machines and of humans' reliance on machines dominate the film .  even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029 , humans continue to use the machines .  in the climax of star wars , luke relies on the force alone--his own spiritual power--to destroy the death star .  in the terminator , however , sara must use another machine--a giant hydraulic press--to vanquish her enemy .  cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable--and he's not happy about it .  unabated technological growth brings about the terminator's other obsession : the apocalypse .  we have plenty of imagery regarding armageddon : thousands of human skulls line the streets of future la .  children watch the flames in a burning television .  when the terminator arrives in 1984 an almost biblical lightning storm precedes him .  even though the "" future is not set , "" there is no doubt about where the world is headed at the end of the movie : the machines will rise and the humans will have to struggle for their very existence .  all sara can do is await it .   ( cameron doesn't wimp out like he does in terminator 2 )  the end of the world is the human race's own fault , too .  after all it is the humans that created in the evil machines in the first place .  back in 1984 , when the cold war was still in full effect , the film must have been seen as a very apt metaphor for nuclear war ( another obsession of cameron's ) .  these days , one can read a criticism of machine-like behavior in humans .  true , humanizing touches are put into paul winfield's and lance henriksen's detective characters , but the terminator is also able to move through the city undetected .  cameron also draw parallels between the mechanical efficiency between the terminator and reese when they first arrive in 1984 la .  from a technical standpoint the terminator is very well done .  arnold schwarzenegger is a perfect antagonist--unstoppable , merciless , obdurate .  we are not meant to empathize with this ultimate killing machine as we are in some of schwarzenegger's later works ( eg , commando ) , but fear him .  cameron and hurd's script basically depicts a one hour and forty-five minute chase , taking a few moments here and there to explain time travel and develop the romantic subplot .  while we do see the hackneyed dialogue cameron is now so well known for , there is also considerable suspense especially for the first time viewer who may be unsure of kyle reese's intentions .  cameron directs the film at a rapid , kinetic pace .  either the camera is moving or something within the frame is moving--usually both occurs .  the violence is not particularly graphic ( temple of doom's heart-pull scene outgrosses the terminator's ) , but it is brutally staged making it that much more effective .  for a low budget film , the terminator's special effects and art direction ( especially in 2029 la ) are remarkably well done .  special mention should be made of the stop motion effects work at the end of the film depicting the terminator endoskeleton .  it is some of the best stop motion i have ever seen .  one thing that doesn't hold up after all the years , however , is linda hamilton's hairdo .

1|"it might surprise some to know that joel and ethan coen , who have brought such unabated lunacy to our movie screens as "" raising arizona "" and "" the hudsucker proxy , "" made their feature film debut with "" blood simple , "" a grim and often gruesome tale of revenge , murder , and literally fatal misconceptions in rural texas .  it bears some resemblance , story-wise , to the coens' recent "" fargo , "" but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here ; "" blood simple "" is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end .  the premise of "" blood simple "" is really just a slight variation on the standard love-triangle/revenge scheme : sleazy bar owner julian marty ( dan hedaya ) hires a shifty private detective ( m .  emmet walsh ) to kill his wife abby ( frances mcdormand ) and her illicit lover ray ( john getz ) .  things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but , upon collecting the money , becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme .  to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much , but what ensues is a series of bloody ( and i do mean bloody ) confrontations , each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening .  every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator's eyes , but we , the audience , are made privy to the "" big picture "" and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person .  this aspect of the story , along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality - one gets the sense that if guns and , in one case , shovels , were not available , some of these characters would claw each other to death - are the most effective components of the film .  the coens might have done well to title the film "" fear and loathing in texas . ""  some have labeled "" blood simple as a modern-day noir , but , while i am not an expert on either genre , it seems more like a horror movie than anything else .  the coens seem much more interested in the plot twists and the atmosphere of confusion and paranoia than they do in the characters , and the final sequence is nothing more than a showdown between the one ( relatively ) innocent character and the only one of the murderers left alive .  that said , "" blood simple "" is a very good horror movie ; the fear and suspense here are genuine .  the coens also add plenty of quirky touches that nudge the weirdness meter upwards , such as when a character enters an empty room and accidentally steps on a gun , discharging it as it skitters across the floor , or when a murder attempt unfolds in a way such that abby mistakes her attacker for another character who has in fact been killed earlier in the film .  that said , "" blood simple "" is not exactly flawless .  for one thing , the motivations for the killings are still a little thin at times ; i can understand that the characters had tracks to cover ( or at least thought they did ) , but i found it a little hard to accept that all of them would so quickly resort to murder .  and although they at least didn ? t have anyone get hacked to death with a knife , the coens also aren't quite immune to horror cliches ; they indulge in a prolonged dead-guy-seems-to-have-come-back-to-life-but-then-we-find-out-it's-only-a-dream scene that had me rolling my eyes .  the film also ends so quickly after the final confrontation that i found myself wondering if they had simply run out of film .   "" blood simple "" is not quite the masterpiece of neo-noir that many seem to think it is , but it's a decent movie and it showcases the coens' ability to handle suspense and violence in a visceral but non-exploitative manner .  i would firmly recommend it to all "" coen-heads "" as well as anyone looking for something original in a thriller .

1|"kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue .  all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow , and you instantly know what he's thinking .   "" detective story "" features one of kirk douglas's finest performances .  he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night .  the film is based on a play , and this is quite evident , as most of the movie takes place in the one-room flat that the detective's work in .  the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife , but through a series of events , he never quite makes it there .  the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider , a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate .  however , this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas's wife ; a connection douglas himself is not aware of .  many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film .  secrets i would not dream of giving away .  with a name like "" detective story "" , one would assume the film would resemble an episode of "" nypd blue "" , but it doesn't quite work out that way .  however , we do see douglas at work on a few other cases throughout the running time .  lee grant ( virtually unrecognizable ) plays a meek jewish woman arrested for shoplifting .  her scenes with bendix , another detective , provide the movie with a few laughs .  the performances all around are fantastic .  douglas may be the leader of this ensemble , but he's not the center of attention all the time .  we get to catch a glimpse into other cases and other detectives working on those cases .  which brings me back to douglas .  he has a really emotional scene towards the end of the picture that really makes you feel for him .  we can see that this is a man who has spent his whole life trying to eliminate crime , but has finally realized that what he's really done is gotten back at his criminal father .  how he handles coming to terms with this is something really worth seeing .  kirk douglas is the kind of actor we don't seem to see to much of these days : he's a tough guy , but the human elements are never hidden too deeply underneath that gruff exterior .

1|" "" a man is not a man without eight taels of gold . ""  starring sammo hung , sylvia chang ; directed by mabel cheung ; written by cheung and alex law ; cinematography by bill wong  eight taels of gold begins as a fish out of water story and at some point becomes a love story involving two people whose past choices prevent the fruition of their love .  neither aspect of the movie is entirely successful , but both are good enough .  and along the way there is one perfect scene , which is one more than you find in most films .  slim ( played by portly sammo hung , better known as a star and director of hong kong action movies ) is a chinese immigrant who drives a yellow cab in new york .  when the movie opens , we see him shouting obscenities at another taxi driver .  he does not seem particularly out of place .  in fact , he is about to return to visit his home in rural china for the first time in sixteen years , spending most of his life savings in the process , and it is there that he will become the proverbial fish out of water , as he realizes that you can never go home .  he brings with him some statue of liberty cigarette lighters , cheap sunglasses , and lobsters ( which have to be large , to prove they're american ) --the tokens of his success .  he also wears a gold chain and a gold watch , because without eight taels of gold , a man is not a man ( my dictionary tells me that taels are a unit of weight used in the far east , and i assume the phrase is a chinese proverb ) .  he loses most of this stuff--except the gold--when his van crashes into a river and he has to hitch a ride , so to speak , on a raft along the river which runs past his parents' village .  when he arrives unannounced , he almost induces cardiac arrest in his father .  all of this has the makings of a routine comedy , and the movie has its amusing moments , as when the villagers take turns giving slim gifts during a celebration of his homecoming , and they all give him birds , so by evening's end he is surrounded by turkeys , ducks , geese and other sundry fowl .  but eight taels is not a comedy--it is a sad , sweet story about the choices people make , and how they are sometimes irreparable .  director mabel cheung ( an autumn's tale , the soong sisters ) sees clearly what it is like to have lived half of your life in one country and half in a country on the other side of the world--what it is like to no longer have a place to call home .  slim does not belong in china , nor does he belong in america , where he can barely speak the language .  seeing water buffalo in the fields and rafts poled down the river and fireworks exploding gloriously in the sky over a small village , we come to know the world slim left behind , and it seems as if he too is knowing it for the first time , and wishes it felt more like home .  the condition of the expatriate is eloquently portrayed ; i , being one , was sympathetic .  on his way to his parent's village , slim hooks up with jenny ( sylvia chang ) , whom he knew when she was a girl nicknamed odds-and-ends , which is what he continues to call her , although she is now a mature , professional , attractive woman , to be married in the spring to an american-chinese man .  slim and odds-and-ends fall for each other .  that's predictable .  the manner in which their ( non- ) romance is played out is not .  the emotions involved are adult and complex , and the film avoids cheap solutions to their dilemma .  it's typical , for instance , that the fianc ? in this sort of plot be a colossal jerk , because it makes it easier to empathize with the unrequited lover .  but here the fianc ? is a decent , ordinary guy , and although slim would like to feel anger , he cannot .  the fianc ? has done nothing wrong ; the situation is the result of bad luck or bad decisions , take your pick .  eight taels has its share of flaws ( the early sequences in america and on the plane to china are especially weak ) , but it compensates with insight .  when odds-and-ends tells slim that her future husband wants to move to san francisco , she notes resignedly , "" it's all the same .  wherever we go , we'll be in chinatown , "" and her straightforward statement expresses much .  there is insight , too , in the understanding of the consequences of slim and odds-and-ends' decisions : he to move to america , she to marry a chinese-american .  both their choices were perhaps born of impatience , perhaps of a sense that the grass is always greener--and it turns out that both choices were wrong .  but they cannot undo them ; they must live with what they have done .  such is life .  the movie is tender toward these people , but it offers no false comforts .  everything that is right and true about eight taels comes together in one great scene , which is the culmination of the love story .  slim and odds-and-ends sit in a secluded spot and talk hesitantly , with the muted pop-pop of fireworks exploding in the night behind them , and it seems the conversation will lead to a kiss .  the exchange that follows , and what slim then does , is poignant and perfect : with clarity and understatement , we see two people's lives , their heartbreaks and virtues , summed up in a single moment .  yes , the film is flawed , but moments like that justify most of its inadequacies .

1|"the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year .  we are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office .  this year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy .  i have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them .  that tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza .  in the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o'connell .  he teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra .  evelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable .  rick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that's why she chose him to lead her there .  also tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn's brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) .  now in hamunaptra , the three uncover "" the book of the dead . ""  the curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book .  along with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra .  not only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt .  don't expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time .  this movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers .  on the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that's up to you to decide .  there is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though .  the state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world .  we are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human's skin .  these may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy .  as of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country .  in the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles .  when playing "" george "" in disney's george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone .  i would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens .  in the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle .  although brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast .  weisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film .  the way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time .  evelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah's , didn't get much personal attention .  in many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part .  in the mummy though , not all of the mixing works .  there are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work .  the mummy could have gotten an "" a "" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these .  i didn't mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them .  the cinematography is amazing in the mummy .  particularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians .  the costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography .  from ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch .  the bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start .

1|"jacques tati's 1953 classic "" les vacances de m . hulot "" ( also known as "" mr . hulot's vacation , "" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film .  the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week's vacation .  yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory .  part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags .  slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don't watch where they're going .  in "" les vacances de m . hulot , "" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key .  in one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat .  while crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it .  when he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues .  tati doesn't waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film .  it has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience's expectations , and "" les vacances de m . hulot "" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well .  tati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement .  when hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark .  tati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , "" oh , he's not going to do that again , "" but , lo and behold , he does .  for example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot's noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel's lights coming on one by one .  then this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce .  the ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy .  as much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did .  the other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters .  it easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons .  instead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem .   "" les vacances de m . hulot "" is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events .  anyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store .  note : "" les vacances de m . hulot "" was not rated by the mpaa .  it would at most receive a pg rating .

1|"the 1990s produced two brilliant science fiction films .  one was _gattaca_ .  the other was _the thirteenth floor_ .  just as _gattaca_ was overshadowed by the mighty _titanic_ , _the thirteenth floor_ was relegated to obscurity by _the matrix_ .  however , _the thirteeth floor_ , though it deals with similar themes , is a much better movie than the frenetic , childish and improbable _matrix_ .  a cutting edge computer scientist , hannon fuller ( played by the charming armin mueller-stahl ) , is murdered .  his associate , douglas hall , ( craig bierko ) apparently framed and suspected by the police , enters into the simulated world they have created in order to unravel the mystery .  along the way a beautiful blonde ( gretchen mol ) , more bodies , and a deepening mystery about simulated worlds complicate the picture .  _the thirteenth floor_ unfolds slowly and telegraphs its punches , choosing to elicit the more complex emotional response of empathy and anticipation rather than the cheap one of mere surprise .  the result is a movie that is a failure from two conventional points of view .  first , its plot revelations can be foreseen if one has carefully followed its complex storyline .  second and more seriously , it demands that its audience think and feel .  no wonder it fell through the cracks .  done in film noir style as a murder mystery , this is a relatively deep movie that functions on several levels .  many audiences will simply be bewildered by it , rather than engaged , which is a shame , because this movie amply repays a little emotional and intellectual investment .  i recommend a second viewing simply to get the flavor of the frequent ironic foreshadowing in the opening parts of the movie .  despite its philosophical challenges , _the thirteenth floor_ derives its emotional force from the love story between jane fuller ( mol ) and douglas hall ( bierko ) , as well as the close friendship between douglas hall and hannon fuller .  in that sense it is more akin to _gattaca_ than _the matrix_ , which , for all of its cute philosophical byplay , is an adolescent movie with no emotional depth whatsoever .  the moment when jane fuller confesses her love for douglas hall is at once satisfying , wrenching and intellectually challenging .  in its final moments the film even takes on itself , when david , jane's husband , who has come to enjoy killing , accuses her of being the sick one .  although there is a victory for the leading characters , this resolution suggests a disturbing element of fantasy in jane , and thus a deep-seated character flaw .  in fact , hannon fuller's activities in the simulated world , the behavior of jane's husband , and the effects of entering the simulation on douglas hall all hint at similar issues with those characters .  this is not a film of good people beset from without by great evil .  the tragedy is not in their stars , but in themselves .  the major actors , all of whom are required to play two or even three roles , perform extremely well .  bierko , who will be familiar as the psycho from _the long kiss goodnight_ , is outstanding .  d'onofrio as whitney , who plays a pivotal role in support , also turns in a good performance .  the lovely gretchen mol , whose elegance , integrity , and determination suggest bergman in _casablanca_ , does a wonderful job .  her voice , however , lacks the necessary weight at times .  this could be because she was given the worst lines in a movie whose major weakness is the script .  some minor flaws , hairline cracks in fine porcelain , appear in places .  there are one or two instances of jerky editing .  the script takes the edge off the film's climaxes .  the atmosphere becomes too claustrophobic at times ( yet , there is a clue there too ) .  one wonders if even after two decades , _blade runner_ is still casting its long shadow over sci-fi films .  one can see a group of suits in their suite , waving their hands imperiously at directors like the emperor in _amadeus_ : "" make it more like_blade runner_ , you know , dark and rainy . ""  _the thirteen floor_ is that rare exception among hollywood movies : a , rich , emotionally satisfying , intelligent sci-fi movie .  and yet , ultimately , it proves the suits right .  for when good sci-fi is made , where is the sf community turning out in droves to see it ?  if we don't support great sf , who will ?

( there's a great scene when he has to cross a floor made of mosaic tiles -- _very_small_ mosaic tiles . )  melvin has some great lines .  when his publisher's receptionist asks him how he writes women so well in his books , he responds "" i think of men and i take away reason and accountability . ""  don't get him wrong , he's not merely a misogynist .  setting his sights higher than that , he's also a homophobe , racist , anti-semite , xenophobe , animal-hater and intensely dislikes people who talk in metaphors .  when we first meet him , he's busy dumping a neighbor's dog down the garbage chute .  he's an equal opportunity bigot .  he does venture outside his apartment every day to eat breakfast at a local cafe .  melvin is such a grouchy curmudgeon that waitress carol connelly ( helen hunt ) is the only one willing to wait on him .  and she's none too happy about it .  when carol doesn't show up for work , melvin's routine is shot and he's determined to do something about it .  tracking down her address , he shows up at her place begging her to come back to work so that he can eat breakfast .  the fact that she's a poor single mother caring for a chronically ill son doesn't appear to phase him , he wants his food .  much more upsetting is that his gay artist neighbor simon bishop ( greg kinnear ) is brutally attacked during a robbery .  this doesn't upset melvin much ( "" don't worry , you'll be back on your knees in no time "" ) but when he is bullied into taking care of simon's dog , his life is turned topsy-turvey .  melvin is sequestered because he's afraid of what's out there on the other side of his apartment door .  he has to make sure it's ritualistically locked three times to keep the world on its proper side .  when he brings the dog home he reluctantly grows fond of it , talking to it and taking it everywhere he goes .  this little crack in his emotional armor opens him up .  hiding behind his need for carol to return to work so she can serve him , he pays for a specialist to treat her son .  he even develops a friendship with simon .  all three people are heavily damaged .  melvin has retreated from life in his apartment .  carol has devoted herself to her son , convinced that she has to give up her life for him .  simon is estranged from his parents and his friends disappear when he is hospitalized and his money runs out .  a more unlikely trio to form relationships , you'd rarely see .  and in the midst of it all , there are some wonderful moments .  melvin is hilarious in his grouchiness and touching as he attempts to be nice .   "" you make me want to be a better man , "" he tells her .  one of the best aspects is that even as he opens up , he is still a curmudgeon .  carol , afraid that his monetary contribution to the wellness of her son hides a hidden agenda rushes over to his apartment in the rain to explain in no uncertain terms that she will never sleep with him .  it only takes her a second to realize that she is delivering that statement while looking as if she just left a wet t-shirt contest .  there's hardly anything left to say about jack nicholson .  i don't remember ever seeing him in anything less than a stellar performance and his over-the-edge melvin is no disappointment .  nicholson may be the best actor working today .  hunt does a commendable job matching nicholson's energy .  she isn't afraid to be seen as something less than a babe and her portrayal of exhausted run-down carol struggling with seemingly overwhelming obligations is top-notch .  their on-screen chemistry is a bit odd .  each does a wonderful job with the character , but together , there's something a little off .  it's a minor problem : they do work well together , but that missing element is what prevents this from being a four-star film .  director james l . brooks ( "" terms of endearment "" , "" broadcast news "" ) has a movie that is picking up awards by the bucketsful ( nominees for all the top golden globes , winners from the national board of review , inevitable oscars ) and has a winner on his hands .

1|"bruce willis stars as malcolm , an award winning child psychologist who discovers one night that one of his former patients is still suffering from inner demons .  the now grown man breaks into his apartment while he and his wife ( olivia williams from rushmore ) are celebrating his award , shoots malcolm in the stomach , then takes his own life .  almost nine months later , malcolm discovers cole ( haley joel osment , in a brilliant performance ) , another young man afflicted with the same turmoil as his former patient .  he takes on the child's case in the hope of redeeming himself for botching up the previous one , alienating his wife in the process .  he soon discovers that they boy can see and speak to the dead , and his life becomes forever turned upside down .  although the first hour is very slow , the sixth sense turns out to be a very powerful and moving film .  i was expecting this film to be mercury rising 2 , but was astonished to discover an extremely well plotted out little thriller with an outstandingly satisfying ending .  you'll find yourself mentally retracing your steps through the film to see if you actually saw what you think you did once the credits roll .  i must give m . night shyamalan a lot of credit for a brilliantly written screenplay .  the cast should also be given a lot of credit for making the movie as solid as it is .  a lesser cast could have made this film a joke .  bruce willis portrays his character perfectly , balancing his need to help cole and his agony over his strained relationship with his wife skillfully .  haley joel osment shines as nine year old cole , showing patience in his character that few young actors these days can pull off .  toni collette , looking markedly different from her pathetic character in muriel's wedding , gives a strong performance as cole's mother , who is trying to cope with both her son's "" illness "" and the passing of her mother .  finally , olivia williams deftly portrays a woman having to struggle with a husband who's not around and flirtations with a co-worker that could lead to a begrudgingly accepted end .  it's a shame that they show cole's abilities in the trailer , because the movie takes close to forty minutes to get around to doing the same , so we already know what's going on before most of the rest of the cast does .  in retrospect though , the forty minute set-up is essential to enjoying the end of the film , so i have fewer complaints now then i did while i was watching the film .  i'm glad that the run of teen-styled horror films has passed and filmmakers are starting to make more adult fare .  films like this , the similarly themed stir of echoes , and countless others to be released later in the year should make for a pretty entertaining close to 1999 .

1|"i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that didn't need a sequel .  beloved by kids and their parents , respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs , that first movie remains a landmark of recent history , the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle-dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting .  if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game ( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions , and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply ) , it didn't show , and as distributor and part-owner of the property , at least it had a piece of the action .  toy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct-to-video project , disney's standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film .  as someone who doesn't believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing ( granted , they usually are a bad thing , but that's because they're made for the wrong reasons ) , i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking .  fortunately , disney claimed to have been so knocked-out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full-speed ahead with a theatrical sequel .  lucky thing , too -- like the first movie , this one is a joy to behold on the big screen , and technically , it improves on its predecessor on just about every level .   ( from a business standpoint , the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar , while the previous film's elements are shared between pixar and disney , a sign of the production house's new cachet in hollywood . )  visually , the main shortcoming of this fully computer-generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly , making them look a little creepy .  fortunately , that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie , where the secret world of toys is more immediate , and arguably more attractive , than the world of the humans who surround them .  as before , the story is predicated on the premise that the toys scattered around the bedroom of a little boy named andy -- and , indeed , all the toys scattered around the bedrooms of all little children -- come to life in the child's absence .  while the toys scamper about and chatter endlessly among themselves , the real joy of a toy's life is to mean something to its owner .  one of the subjects of this new film is the sadness of toys that have been broken or abandoned , left on a shelf to gather dust , and another is the sort of emotional limbo inhabited by toys that are mere prizes of covetous collectors .  most often , those toys are packed away in dark spaces , safe from sunlight and humidity , and often they're not even removed from their packaging .  imagine what a chip that would put on your shoulder , and you'll understand the attitudes of the collector's items that show up in this movie .  sheriff woody ( voiced by a note-perfect tom hanks ) , the longtime favorite among andy's toys who was challenged in the previous go-round by the arrival of flashy-new-thing action figure buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , suffers an injury early in the film , when andy tugs too hard on his arm and pulls a seam apart , revealing the stuffing inside .  this accident catalyzes some uneasieness among the toys , who know too well that a broken toy is often a forgotten toy , and a forgotten toy is one that loses its reason for existence .  those anxieties are crystallized when andy's mom tears through his living room , collecting old toys for a yard sale .  and there's an ironic twist to the tale , as woody winds up being stolen by an avid toy collector who needs exactly that quaint cowboy figure to complete a set that he hopes to sell to a japanese toy museum for a sizable sum .  the rest of andy's toys , who owe him quite a debt , resolve to rescue him .  that this film manages to turn a box marked "" 25 cents "" into a symbol of doom , or to make its screed against the retention of collectible toys by wrongheaded profiteers fuel for a metaphysical dilemma , is a testament to its skill at metaphor , seamlessly translating the hopes and fears of our real world into that of the toys .  operating on this level of abstraction , toy story 2 tackles some mighty heavy issues without once preaching or veering into pretentiousness .   ( the worst i can say is that randy newman seems to have reserved his sappiest lyric in years for sarah mclachlan , who stops the movie cold by singing it at just about the halfway mark . )  sometimes i think toy story 2 tries too hard .  there's somewhat less of the seat-of-the-pants loopiness that energized the first film , allowing it to surprise and excite on a near-constant basis , and more philosophizing about toys , collectors , the nature of happiness and the meaning of life .  while that leads to fewer bellylaughs , it does make way for more elaborate humor and an uncommonly ambitious reflexivity that asks the toys to consider their own status as commodities that move in and out of fashion .   ( just don't ask why andy's favorite toy is based on a tv series that was canceled in 1957 . )  where else in mainstream movies do you get such an awesome moment as the one where buzz arrives at al's toy barn to find it stocked to the gills with his doppelgangers , buzz lightyear action figures ?  forget the self-congratulatory science fiction of the matrix -- this is a fundamental mind-bender for buzz , and the audience shares his humility and wonderment at the sight .  here , as in the roughly concurrent scene where woody watches tapes of the howdy doodyish children's tv show that originated his character , we see our protagonists come face-to-face with god .  in sly ways , then , toy story 2 can be read as a film about mortality , a metaphorical consideration of aging and death .  significantly , the film's very first sequence concludes with a grim shocker that had our opening-night crowd in a near-uproar .  and toward the end , when buzz and woody speculate on how long they have before andy grows up and discards his old toys , one of them observes , with an alacrity both inspirational and heartbreaking , that it will be fun while it lasts .  so toy story 2 joins the tradition of children's stories , largely neglected of late , that say something real about the inevitable joys and tragedies of existence .  what's really striking is that both toy story films ( and , to a lesser degree , pixar's a bug's life ) are kids' movies with wit and sophistication to shame most of their ostensibly adult counterparts , not to mention whatever piece of tot-friendly eye-candy is due from the disney dream factory any given summer .  it puts one in mind of the glory days of chuck jones and the old gang at warner bros . animation .  i'm not sure lasseter and his pals at pixar will ever operate at quite that level of purely visual invention -- they love traditional narrative too much -- but , boy , it makes me wonder what they might come up with next .  -------------------------------------------------------------- directed by john lasseter , colin brady , ash brannon , and lee unkrich written by lasseter , brannon , peter docter , andrew stanton , rita hsaio , doug chamberlain , and chris webb cinematography by sharon calahan starring ( voices ) tom hanks , tim allen , and joan cusack usa , 1999  theatrical aspect ratio : 1 . 85 : 1 --------------------------------------------------------------  "|0.5666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|Toy Story 2 is praised for its positive impact on the animation industry, its appeal to both children and adults, and its ability to tackle deep themes without being preachy.

1|"tone alone cannot sustain a film , but it can go a long way .  if i can find myself lost in the time and place of a story , it scores immediate style points .  when that tone is backed up by an outstanding story and great acting , the effect can be described best by an adjective i do not use lightly : "" literary . ""  what's eating gilbert grape ?  is such a film .  it's a rich , memorable and stunningly acted story of desire colliding with responsibility , staged in a manner which many viewers might find too prosaic , but which insinuated itself into my imagination with its confidence .  gilbert grape ( johnny depp ) is a young man living in rural endora , iowa , facing incredible responsibilities .  as the man of the house since his father's suicide , gilbert must support the family by working at the local grocery store .  he also must watch over his mentally handicapped brother arnie ( leonardo dicaprio ) and help care for his extremely overweight mother ( darlene cates ) .  gilbert seems destined to spend the rest of his life in the small town until the arrival in endora of becky ( juliette lewis ) , a free spirit passing through with her grandmother when their truck breaks down .  as he spends time with becky , gilbert begins to think about all the things he is missing .  slowly his resentment builds , until he realizes that he can no longer live his entire life for other people .  director lasse hallstrom ( my life as a dog ) and legendary cinematographer sven nykvist create a magnificent visual backdrop for peter hedges' screenplay , based on his own novel .  endora is a town on the edge of the world represented by the giant foodmart , a tiny insular community where everyone knows everyone else .  the midwestern sunsets and sprawling fields are beautifully photographed , and the atmosphere of the town is intensely real .  minor characters , like crispin glover as the town's mortician , are vividly realized , and there are echoes of the last picture show in mary steenburgen's desperately unhappy housewife .  one of the most perfectly realized scenes focuses on the grand opening of a burger franchise , attended by the entire town and accompanied by the off-key high school band .  not a single note in the depiction of endora rang false .  the same can be said of the character of gilbert .  it's testimony to the precision involved in his creation that he came together completely with one perfectly placed line , when becky responds to gilbert's description of his father with , "" i knew someone like that once . ""  gilbert is a man harboring an ever-growing bitterness about where he finds himself in life , a bitterness which reveals itself in moments of surprising cruelty .  in one scene , he allows local children to look at his mother through their window , displaying her like a side show attraction .  his entire life seems to be mocked by arnie's repeated chants of , "" we're not going anywhere , "" but instead of expressing his dissatisfaction he lets his anger simmer , and it becomes clear that he is following in his father's footsteps in this regard .  johnny depp expertly demonstrates the tension central to gilbert by playing everything below the surface , but he never gives in to one-dimensional blankness or simply regurgitates his naif roles in benny & joon and edward scissorhands .  depp's performance is overshadowed , however , by leonardo dicaprio's astonishing oscar-nominated supporting work as arnie .  he puts to shame such big name actors as john malkovich and dustin hoffman , whose mentally challenged characters never seemed completely real .  dicaprio is perfect to the last twitch and squeal , and anyone who has ever spent time with mentally challenged kids will be hard-pressed to spot a flaw .  darlene cates , a first-time actor , brings real pain to her scenes as gilbert's tortured mother , and laura harrington and mary kate schellhardt are solid as gilbert's sisters .  only juliette lewis doesn't quite click , playing a critical role with her now familiar dopey drone and too little genuine spark .  gilbert grape does seem to drift into its conclusion , but it never lost me .  thanks to a lovingly created setting and a marvelous cast , this 1993 release proves well worth the wait .

1|hollywood has a . 750  batting average with elmore leonard adaptations .  last year's touch was ill-conceived and just plain odd but get shorty , jackie brown and now out of sight all were highly entertaining movies .  steven soderburgh , master of sex , lies and videotape , now adds crime to his repertoire in this tale of bank robbery , prison , double-crossing , uncut diamonds and , oh yeah , true love .  george clooney is the protagonist , a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker , but for once i didn't want to slap the taste out of his mouth .  he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant-type perfected in hitchcock movies , the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other .  nowhere present is clooney's usual ain't-i-sexy sneer -- there's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style .  clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty .  clooney plays a man who's robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun .  in the opening scene , he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm .  of course , he gets caught , so it's not all good .  it's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate's ( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig ) collection of diamonds in detroit .  clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score , while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans .  meanwhile , there's jennifer lopez .  unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda , she's finally graduated to a worthy role as the u . s . marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes .  rhames is waiting to give him a ride in a stolen car , and lopez makes it a threesome , her hostage ass locked in a trunk with clooney .  he's covered in dirt and has a gun to her neck , and it's a little cramped in there , but they manage to make a love connection anyway , probably because it's a movie .  the relationship between clooney and lopez is at the heart of the movie , and one of the details that elevates it beyond your normal noir-ish crime story .  the leonard movies are more obsessed with dialogue than crime , and this is no exception .  although they're not really germane to the plot , lopez's relationship with her father ( dennis farina of get shorty ) , rhames' relationship with his christian sister ( you could call her sister christian ) and a pop-in cameo by michael keaton all lend extra class to a movie already full of it .  out of sight spans at least three years but has a non-linear structure , focusing on the jailbreak / brooks score and flashing back to earlier times .  this is a movie with a brain , as smooth and calculated as the clooney and lopez characters themselves .  the entire cast does the material justice -- clooney and lopez coming into their own , and rhames and cheadle cementing their positions as two of my favorites .  here's hoping future leonard adaptations continue to carry the torch .  serving america for almost 1/20th of a century !  |0.7493333333333334|0.8846666666666666|0.8306666666666667|The sentiment of the text is consistently positive as the author praises the entertaining nature of the movies, compliments the performances of the actors (especially George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez), highlights the positive aspects such as the plot and relationships, and expresses hope for future adaptations of Elmore Leonard's work.
1|synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage .   ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan . )  in the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china .  a girl's parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle .  mulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father .  ten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph .  the emperor wants to reward mulan's valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes .  mulan's old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman .  the disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy ) .  in disney's mulan , when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army .  old mr . fa ( soon-tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming-na wen ) .  fearing for her father's life , the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair , disguises herself as a man , and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father's stead .  meanwhile mushu , the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family , has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner .   ( his only duty is to ring a gong . )  mushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero .  with the help of mushu , a horse , and a lucky cricket , can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family ?  opinion : east meets west .  i know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors .  from their state of the art animation studio in orlando , disney is hoping to work the same kind of east/west magic with mulan .  i mean , what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art , with donny osmond singing , ming-na wen acting , and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson ?  yet this is the case in the disney's re-interpretation of the familiar chinese classic .  the end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney's best movies ever .  personally , i'm also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak-willed subservient asian woman take a beating : mulan is portrayed as a normal , if spirited , compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative .  mulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney .  kids of any age will like the family themes , and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing .  and adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor , while the boys admire the battles .  and adults can admire those male/female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family , honor , and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love , gumption , and questioning .  but even the tiniest details reveal quality .  the movie's art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces , positive detail , period clothing , and graphic designs typical of the time and place .  computers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 , 000 people , and a special program called 'attila' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback .  and singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game .  balance is crucial .  a movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney's cup of tea , but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine , then , pow !  the dream team .  by the same token , a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself , but toss the dragon in there and you've got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp .  it's rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west , old and young , male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole , but mulan hits the universal bullseye .  it's movie for any age , creed , gender , or color .  |0.48333333333333334|0.8166666666666668|0.7666666666666666|"The movie ""Mulan"" is praised for its positive portrayal of a strong female lead and its ability to blend Eastern and Western influences, resulting in a universally appealing film."
1|"if you've ever perused my college comedy diary "" another year in the life of a nerd "" ( i never run out of cheap plugs ) , you know i didn't get along with my first-semester roommate too well .  in fact , during the three-week period between thanksgiving and christmas break , i said a total of four sentences to him .  so when i saw in the residence hall cable listings a movie called roommates , i envisioned 90 minutes of conflict between a couple of bickering young adults trapped in a 10 x 13 foot dorm room .  then i saw that the star of roommates is peter falk .  scratch that idea .  but i still say someone should film the story of two college roommates whose relationship is less than ideal .  of course , in my case it would be a silent picture .  even without the college element , i still decided to watch roommates because i had absolutely nothing to do , unless you count studying for final exams ( and who does ? ) .  i'm glad i did .  peter falk's performance was actually what made the movie .  and this is a guy i never considered a real actor , more like someone who went around in a trenchcoat solving prescripted mysteries .  falk pleasantly surprised me here , permanently earning my respect , so all you "" columbo "" fans who think i live to insult the guy can just falk off .  falk plays rocky , a 107-year-old polish baker who raises his grandson after both the kid's parents die .  the movie begins with the mom's death and the son moving in with his grandparents .  after a couple stops along the son's journey to manhood , roommates progresses to the present day , with the grandson a surgeon and rocky in a condemned house he refuses to leave .  the surgeon reluctantly offers the only possible solution -- rocky will have to move into his place , the basement of a building rented by a group of chinese students ( "" communists !

1|"capsule : the director of cure brings a weird and very complex concept to the screen .  one viewing will not be enough to understand fully the premise of pulse .  the idea is something about ghosts and the internet .  the film has an amazing apocalyptic style .   , +2 ( -4 to +4 )  perhaps the most disturbing ( and disturbed ? )  filmmaker in the world is kiyoshi kurosawa .  his films all seem to have one style , bleak .  the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold .  little known in the us to date , his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver .  most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid .  his 1998 film cure , with one of his niftiest ideas , is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with .  cure is probably his classic .  last year he released seance , a remake of seance on a wet afternoon .  that was perhaps a miscalculation inserting supernatural elements into a non-supernatural story .  pulse is kurosawa back on form .  taguchi , a young computer expert , is late with his delivery of some important software .  two co-workers go to his apartment and find it a dismal dark affair in spite of his computer equipment .  taguchi , acting very strangely , lets his friends look for the missing software .  meanwhile he slips behind a plastic curtain .  when he fails to respond to calls his friends follow him behind the curtain and discover he has hanged himself .  if that was not horror enough the body seems to disappear leaving just a strange dark mildew-like spot on the wall .  taguchi's computer seems to have been infected with some kind of computer virus .  people whose computer gets the virus seem superficially to die via suicide .  but they are not entirely dead .  their spirits seem to remain present somehow in the real world and on the internet .  people who get the computer virus are asked if they want to see a ghost .  if they say yes , they seem to be able to see real time images of the spirits still nearby somehow .  the computer shows them impossible images of ghosts in their own rooms as seen from cameras that do not exist .  this is all somehow connected to heaven and hell somehow filling up and overflowing "" like a computer disk . ""  instead the dead seem to be staying on earth and inhabiting computer viruses .  there is some sort of passage between worlds having something to do with doors marked with red tape and strange electronic disturbances on computers .  leave it to kurosawa to find a new kind of death .  this is a film that has more weird ideas piled together than lifeforce and somehow kurosawa makes the film all work .  it may not totally convey his message of isolation and its parallels to death , but whatever it does convey is nightmarish .  kurosawa , who directs his own screenplay , ties his story into the real world with some familiar and accurate computer discussion .  frequently the plot is advanced with character hunches being assumed to be fact .  his plotting is frequently hard to follow and always very strange .  junichiro hayashi , the cinematographer who recently has been doing all of kurosawa's films , creates a dark , cold , and gloomy tone .  images are obscured by semi-lighting or are behind plastic curtain .  scenes are not milked for their horror the way american exploitation films might .  people are shot with guns but there is little if any blood in evidence .  seeing black silhouettes on computer screens is not immediately scary .  kurosawa is not going for and easy visual shock , but a deeper metaphysical dread .  of any horror filmmaker in the world , kiyoshi kurosawa is the one to watch .  i rate this metaphysical look at isolation a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .

1|"when i first heard that disney's next animated feature was going to be tarzan , i was almost horrified .  i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules ( sorry , jerk-ules ) .  that effort was too overloaded with comedy ( and the hero was too boastful and pompous to be considered a sympathetic hero ) , and , after viewing it to this day , i find it a disgrace for disney animation .  when i saw the trailers , i was thinking "" hmm . . .  this isn't bad at all .  this just might have potential . ""  when i bought the soundtrack , i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features .  i have never really heard of phil collins , nor have i heard of mark mancina , so i was wondering , how would these two make this disney flick spin ?  i was pleasantly surprised : the music is top-notch .  phil collins' songs are terrific , percussion-heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs .  the score from mark mancina was also neat ; it reminded me a bit of the lion king , but it was more original .  so , the soundtrack wasn't bad at all , considering it was by two people i am not familiar with .  this film could be good . . .  but will it be ?  when i finally went to see it ( on opening day , as i tend to do with most disney animated features ) , my question was answered , in a complete turnabout of expectations for me : disney's tarzan is surprisingly decent .  the story starts out with tarzan's parents surviving a shipwreck and finding a home on an island where apes live in peace .  however , one day , a vicious leopard , sabor , attacks and kills tarzan's parents , leaving him ( at this time , a baby ) alone-until kala of the apes rescues him .  kala wants to raise the child as her own ( she lost hers previously to sabor ) , but her mate , kerchak is not too sure .   "" it's not our kind , "" he says .  he agrees , though , to let her take care of little tarzan , but "" that doesn't make him my son . ""  tarzan grows up , vowing to be "" the best ape ever "" , but no matter how hard he tries or what he does ( at the guidance of his hilarious ape friend , terk ) , he just can't convince kerchak that he is one of the apes , even when he defeats sabor in a battle .  one day , a new animal shows up : humans .  this is where jane comes into the picture .  she is on an expedition with her father ( professor porter ) , and a despicable hunter ( clayton ) searching for gorillas .  tarzan rescues her when she is chased by baboons , and soon they get to know each other .  even though tarzan falls in love with jane , this causes things to go wrong .  clayton tricks tarzan into taking him , jane , and porter to see the apes , who are convinced that he has betrayed them .  worse , clayton has plotted to send the gorillas to london for money .  will tarzan find out which family he belongs to and save the apes ?  i'm not gonna tell you , sorry .  you're gonna have to see for yourself .  and see it you should ; the animation is , as always , top notch , particularly when tarzan goes soaring through the trees ( read that , skateboarding ) .  the deep canvas computer generated effect adds an authentic feeling to the jungle which tarzan lives in .  in fact , it seems similar to the computer imagery/cel animation combination in rival disney animted films , such as fox's anastasia and dreamworks' prince of egypt .  could it be that disney was actually taking ideas from their rivals ?  the casting is fairly good .  tony goldwyn is emotionally believeable as tarzan ( and to my relief , the animators have succeeded in not making him another hercules .  nicely done ) , and glenn close is wonderful as kala ( she has a beautiful singing voice , too , by the way ) .  lance henrikson as kerchak somewhat reminds me of robby benson's beast voice , which makes him all the more ferocious and gripping .  minnie driver had me a little worried at first as the voice of jane .  i thought she had the most annoying voice in the whole film ( when i first saw the trailers ) , but when i saw the film , i didn't have a problem with her .  i take back my insult on driver .  it's nice to hear nigel hawthorne do another voice for a disney animated feature ( he was fflewdurr flamm in disney's most underrated classic , the black cauldron ) ; he is funny and delightful as professor porter .  on the villiany side of the voices , brian blessed ( the guy who did boss nass in star wars : episode i-the phantom menace ) brings a pompous , and later on vicious , voice to the sinister clayton .  he might not be the strongest character in the film ( he's just a plain bad guy , nothing else ) , but blessed's vocal work contributes greatly .  but if there is any voice that i think steals the whole show , it should be rosie o'donnell , who is hilariously funny as terk .  she also has a fiesty attitude ( "" i'm gonna kill ya ! ""  she says , more than once ) .  i almost sung along with her during one of the film's best moments , where the apes make a mess of the human's camp , via song , er , scatting "" shoo-be-doo , da-be-dah "" .  i can see why she wanted to have a rock song for the film , she's a good singer .  not that she was the only funny character in the film , though .  wayne knight ( who played stan in space jam ) gives a whimsically funny style to tantor , an elephant who is especially worried about stepping into "" un-sanitary "" water .   ( thankfully , there is no real sound of flatuence-that would have killed the picture ) .  the songs , as i said before , are decent , mostly sung by collins .  this sets a new standard for disney animated films because for the first time , the characters do not sing .  i tolerate musical numbers from characters a lot more than some other guys would , but i found this to be a nice change of pace .  the story does have elements of comedy in it , but they also load it with strong dramatic touches , which makes this film far better than the unbelieveably uninspired hercules .  if there is anything disappointing about tarzan , it might be the omission of the 'n sync version of "" trashing the camp "" from the film .  i heard it on the soundtrack , and wondered where it was going to be .  i was upset that it wasn't , because i had thought of taking a few friends of mine who like 'n sync to see tarzan .  oh , well . . .  overall , i was enthralled with tarzan .  i wouldn't hold it high the way i do with mulan or the hunchback of notre dame ( my all-time favorite disney classics ) , but this film deserves a high place among disney's greatest achievements .  i give a nod to disney for following up their spectacular * * * * * masterpiece , mulan , with this great animated adaption of egar rice burrough's tarzan .

1|"the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it's armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo .  we soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo's ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control .  however , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade .  no sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins .  it seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas's trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time .  we're the fans , not the freaks .  we won't go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won't incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we're throwing down .  all right , stop looking at me like that .  we have been faithfully and patiently waiting .  waiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll .  you see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah .  unfortunately , it is not our savior .  for weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good .  anything less and it'll be the biggest disappointment of the century .  i didn't want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn't , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking .  character development is virtually nonexistent .  with the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film's characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions .  none seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all .  contrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala .  jar jar's life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) .  his speech mannerisms are so "" cute-ified "" that i couldn't understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting .  his head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as "" deep doo doo , "" and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport .  therein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors .  in star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a "" wretched hive of scum and villainy . ""  in the phantom menace , we get doo doo .  the films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story "" a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . . . ""  this film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it's only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience .  perhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it's kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play .  i liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ?  the race would have been even more exciting without the distraction .  this aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me .  i suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ?  didn't millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ?  didn't the action figures still sell like hotcakes ?  of course they did , and it's only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults .  one aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects .  the people at lucas's industrial light and magic , the world's premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage .  some of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation's robot army and jar jar's countrymen .  the space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer .  this , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today .  john williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can .  his music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately .  since this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar .  as a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin .  it would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi-wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films .  one of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film's release .  in spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost didn't have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant .  he has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean .  with that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment .  lucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout .  however , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story-writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real-life connection .  oddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force-loving parasites in your body's cells .  this only serves to de-mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection .  don't let me mislead you too far .  the phantom menace , by most standards , is a good film .  it contains a lot of visual treats , sets the stage for an epic story , gives us a bit of excitement here and there , and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends .  it's just that when held up to it's predecessors ( and to not do so would be unrealistic ) , this film simply pales .

1|"in december of 1996 , a little movie called "" scream , "" was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens .  first , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both "" scream "" movies , "" i know what you did last summer , "" "" urban legend , "" etc . ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a 'la '80s john hughes ) , starting with last june's "" can't hardly wait . ""  it may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : "" varsity blues , "" "" jawbreaker , "" "" cruel intentions , "" "" simply irresistible , "" "" the rage : carrie 2 , "" and "" the mod squad . ""  coming april 9 are two more of this type : "" never been kissed "" and "" go , "" and on april 23 , we've got the teen satire "" election "" and the teen horror-comedy "" idle hands . ""  jeesh !  out of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , "" 10 things i hate about you , "" is this past january's mediocre , ho-hum "" she's all that . ""  although similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , "" 10 things i hate about you , "" a modern-day version of shakespeare's "" the taming of the shrew "" ( "" she's all that "" got its inspiration from "" pygmalion "" ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985's "" the breakfast club . ""  and to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn't have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in "" she's all that ? "" ) .  the day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) .  although he doesn't know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won't allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to .  kat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) .  complicating matters , cameron's dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey .  as you can see , "" 10 things i hate about you "" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven't even mentioned , such as kat's shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca's materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) .  at a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of "" she's all that , "" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , "" you're vapor "" ) .  since i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained .  aside from a good screenplay , it's the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot .  aside from joseph gordon-levitt ( "" 3rd rock from the sun "" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings .  as the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries "" the '60s "" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her .  even though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat's way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality .  no one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does .  heath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles .  one other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set .  in one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has .  one off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school's staff act , which is strikingly unformal .  allison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl "" chill "" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good .  although there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters .  in one very funny scene , chastity asks , "" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? ""  at another point , bianca and kat's father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it's like to be pregnant .   "" 10 things i hate about you "" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the '90s .  it also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave '80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) .  by the film's end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) .  luckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about "" 10 things i hate about you , "" but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten .

1|along his carreer , mel gibson has collected several successes , not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view .  for all that , i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart .  the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace , a popular scotch hero of the 13th century , where he would also perform the principal role .  accepting so huge challenge , mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years , with a suppoosed failure , just to see recognized , by everyone , all his potentialities and , that way , to consolidate his position in hollywood .  it was , definitely , an enormous risk but i'm sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face .  braveheart is , in fact , a magnificent and magisterial film .  for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative's rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest .  the william wallace's story is the story of so many others brave liberty's defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value , along the centuries .  seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression , william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i , king of england , in a war by the autonomy of scotland .  as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up .  his courage and inteligence are admired by everyone , including the princess isabelle of wales , wife of edward's son .  however , william wallace was also surrounded by enemies and some of them were closer than he thought .  braveheart may not be an historically corrected movie but the nature of its message make us think about the importance that we give to liberty , nowadays .  mel gibson directs with a lot of brilliancy a brilliant cast .  patrick mcgoohan has a very nice performance as edward i , the king longshank .  the scene when he waits for the death and loses his voice is really good .  sophie marceau , as princess isabelle , has along the movie no more than fifteen minutes of performance but mel gibson gave to those minutes such a very special treatment that princess isabelle soon becomes one of the major characters in braveheart .  i also liked the performances of angus macfadyen , as robert the bruce , and , of course , mel gibson , as william wallace .  however , i think this time the mel gibson's work as director was much better than his work as actor .  the excellent music composed by james horner is another thing that helps braveheart to be the success that it really is .  when we join that music to the beautiful scotch landscapes , view by the camera of john toll , then we realize all the beauty of this film .  braveheart is , in my opinion , one of the best movies of 1995 !  i've heard some people saying that mel gibson is gonna be a new david lean .  for now , let's see if braveheart equalizes the 6 oscars of lawrence of arabia .  it won't be easy !  it's gonna be one more challenge for mel gibson .  |0.7999999999999999|0.8833333333333333|0.8166666666666668|The explanations highlight the highly positive sentiment towards Mel Gibson's career, particularly his success with the film Braveheart.

1|"renown surrealist director , the 77-year-old frenchman alain resnais ( hiroshima , mon amour/last year at marienbad/m ? lo ) , has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven ( 1978 tv serial , 1981 movie ) and the singing detective ( 1986 ) .  the film follows potter's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip-synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts .  he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct , such as "" the umbrellas of cherbourg "" and "" the young girls of rochefort . ""  the tale has resnais's unique touches as a director to go along with his homage .  it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person , and that there is a song in everyone's heart for every occasion .  what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters , the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience ( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers ) , and the farce seems more banal than daring .  yet it is not without its striking moments and charms , such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs .  also , the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story , while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else , which has always been embellished in movie lore , comes through with flying colors .  it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there .  it tells the romantic story of six parisians who become intertwined with each other in their ordinary lives as they search for happiness .  they are the attractive sisters odile ( sabine az ? ma ) and camille ( agnes jaoui ) , with the older businesswoman odile married and decidedly set on a bourgeois life of material comforts .  she is married to the glum and laconic claude ( pierre arditi ) .  she once went out with a businessman , nicolas ( jean-pierre bacri ) , who left her 8-years ago and now shows up in paris and asks her help to find someone to rent a flat for his family .  simon ( andre dussolier ) works as a real-estate salesman and is trying to find nicolas a flat , in his spare time he writes radio plays .  simon's boss is the much younger , unscrupulous and arrogant marc duveyrier ( lambert wilson ) , who inherited the firm from his father and is the real-estate agent selling a more luxurious and larger flat with a better view to odile , but fails to tell her that a building project is going up soon that will block her view .  screenwriters and actors jean-pierre bacri and agnes jaoui wrote themselves the best parts .  jaoui's camille is a university scholar finishing up a ph . d .  in history , using for her thesis the study of 'the yeomen in the year 1000 at lake paladru . '  she works as a tour guide in the meantime and suffers from panic attacks , even though she appears to have outwardly perfect self-control .  on her tours for the last four years has been the much older simon , pretending to be doing research for his plays but really attracted to her , but not having the nerve to tell her this .  to his dismay , he finds out she is dating his mean-spirited but handsome boss , whom she meets when looking at her sister's new place and seeing him crying but not realizing that it was from a cold , not because he's so sensitive .  bacri as the classy nicolas , turns out to be now working as a chauffeur .  he is a hypochondriac with a history of depression who visits many doctors , until he finds one who tells him there is nothing wrong with him .  odile still pines for him , but he's married , telling her he expects his wife to arrive shortly .  love is 'the same old song' that makes the world go 'round , even when all the characters are liars and not exactly open to what their true motives are .  everything comes together in a bourgeois housewarming party for odile's place , as the characters reveal their true feelings and all their deceptions and neurotic impulses are either uncovered or about to be .  there's not a lot of bite to this satirical musical , but resnais has never made a bad film and is one of the best current french directors , if not the best .  this film is not one his great ones , but it still has enough pep in its light touches to be interesting .  it not only has an odd way for the characters to break into song but -- some males even sing in a female voice while some females sing in a male voice .  it is also interesting in the way it examines its characters' behavior as being similar in business as in love .  "|0.16666666666666666|0.8000000000000002|0.7333333333333334|The film has both positive elements, such as striking moments and charms, as well as negative aspects like unengaging characters and forgettable songs.

1|"in 1987 the stock market crashed , and oliver stone's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses .  wall street lucked out in its timing ; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had , and though its kill-or-be-killed approach to business was exaggerated , that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan-era businessman .  stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs . evil tale relayed in the fast-paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange .  critics and audiences lauded wall street , elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic .  i'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them .  i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone's output with its thin caricatures , obvious sentiments , and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen .  stone goes for broke in every scene ( the same could be said for nearly all of his works ) .  this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions .  he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane .  it's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity , rather than explore what these situations are really like .  i have a feeling the brokers would be psychologically manipulative ( as they are presented in boiler room ) rather than laughably over the top .  these guys are salesmen after all , not televised judges .  more than anything i am baffled by why so many adore wall street .  the only possible solution i can muster is its release date .  and not just the timeliness of the "" greed is good "" subject matter : the film was plumped down in the eighties , a decade in which the one-joke comedy rose to an art form , and a group of glamorous brat packers smirked their way through inane high concept , low result movies .  in my mind , the eighties will forever be remembered as a decade with not only a proliferation of bad movies , but bad music , bad hair , and bad clothes .  maybe stone's after school special set in wall street was viewed as a welcome change of pace .  boiler room is an equally well-timed film with some similarities to stone's piece of crap .  they both feature a consequential father-son relationship , though boiler room's is much more subtle and touching .  and they are both concerned with the power of greed , yet the men in boiler room are akin to poseurs presuming to be big shots rather than the slippery-smooth , heartless gordon gecko figures of wall street .  boiler room is a message movie as well , though ( at least until the end ) doesn't shove it in our faces .  boiler room is about the pursuit of cash and the degrees to which people will go for that cash .  as i said , this film is indeed timely in a society where who wants to be a millionaire is the number one prime time show every day ( bringing about a revolution of prime time tv watching that hasn't been seen in quite a while ) ; not only do we want to be millionaires , we want to watch other people become millionaires !  in our super-judgmental , power-oriented culture the desire for money supersedes everything ; when you have money , you have it "" all "" .  and seth ( giovanni ribisi ) wants it "" all "" the easy way .  he's a well-intentioned college drop out who gets lured into working for an illegally run brokerage firm ( the kind that sells junk stock ) whereupon he meets others just like him .  ben affleck is cast as jim , the company headhunter , who struts in commanding the room like a frat boy gordon gecko .  his job is to influence trainee's into becoming enthusiastic employees by giving a speech that subtly attacks their man hood .  it's ironic that he sells these pups the same load of b . s that they're told to dish out to prospective buyers .  affleck's character is obviously supposed to recall alec baldwin's similar character in glengary glen ross , and that proves detrimental to the actor's performance .  affleck shouts , curses and be-littles his rookie employees just like baldwin , minus the edge .  when alec played the scene he became the part , spewing those brutal lines as if they were his own .  by comparison affleck simply looks as if he were doing a really hammy line reading .  the brokers approach their job with the fervor of overzealous jocks : they storm to work like football players on the way to the big game .  rap music thumps on the soundtrack effectively illustrating who these guys think they are : intellectual gangsters .  they aren't above a rumble as a test of man hood especially during leisure time where the lumbering scott caan seems all too eager to use his fists in minor disputes .  we drink up this world along with seth , and watch him become seduced by it , just like we might be .  as in all cautionary tales , boiler room begins with seducing us into its illustrious world of profit and wrongdoing , then smacks us with the consequences of all the recklessness .  i know this story .  we all do .  but it can work if it's told with intelligence and energy , and that is how writer \ director ben younger tells it .  as a director of ( please excuse my french ) mise-en-scene younger has much to learn .  his style is sitcom bland .  but his writing isn't .  younger's script is well studied in the vernacular of this bunch ; his dialogue is like a junior david mamet .  despite the moderate camera work younger fills his phone-pitch scenes with tension that comes from just the performances and the tightly wound script .  the brokers \ hucksters counter every customer objection , gently bullying them into buying stock .  these moments are filmed like psychological action scenes : a tense confrontation between a victimizer and a victim who isn't aware that he is one .  with the exception of affleck's brief appearances , the performances are truly exceptional .  ribisi , who has the edgy looks of a character actor , is extremely potent here , working his pale angular face , and eerie , plaintive stare for all their worth .  he conveys child-like vulnerability ( his character seems to hide in a corner whenever things aren't going his way ) in some scenes , and in others he's ferociously cut throat .  the jekyll and hyde contradiction works well in the movie : ribisi is confident when it's just him and the phone , but cowardly in front of authority figures including his abrasive father ( authoritatively played by ron rifkin ) .  boiler room thankfully avoids wall street-like histrionics in the sales-pitch sequences ; the sales build slowly like a crescendo of intelligent psychological ploys .  those ploys are taught to seth by chris ( vin diesel ) , a kind broker who alternates between seth's friend and his mentor .  diesl shines in his minor role .  this week i saw the sci-fi opus pitch black in which diesel plays a completely different role in an equally effective manner .  in that film he has the kind of role that might have gone to arnold schwarzenegger in the 80's , and in boiler room he has the kind of role that might have gone to elliot gould in the 70's .  nicky katt is also memorable as a superior broker obsessed with what he can't have .  nia long , as the firm's secretary , ( a lone black women amongst many white men ) is ribisi's love interest in a part that at first looks to be as insignificant as most of the parts this talented actress gets , but develops into something more interesting .  the two make an oddly likeable couple .  long is smart and brash , and ribisi is charmingly aloof .  at one point he says to her "" i'm just lookin' for some chocolate love "" .  it's a terrible line but ribisi delivers it in such an innocuous child-like way , it becomes sweetly endearing .  unfortunately , towards the end , the boiler room turns a tad schmaltzy .  there is much crying , hugging , and sorrowful stares .  this is okay when taken in small doses , but younger's conclusion is constructed as a series of these boo-hoo moments , one following the other .  a particular misstep is his attempt to show the effect that seth's manipulations have on one of his poor victims .  it's not a bad idea but the execution is lacking , with those scenes feeling tacked on to further spell out the message .  that message being , "" greed is bad "" .  yes it's patently obvious , but boiler room conveys it by introducing us to a culture that i haven't seen much of in the movies : the disenfranchised twenty something entrepreneur .  and all wall street did was introduce us to a simplistic fantasy world of saints and sinners .  boiler room offers neither extreme .  it gives us what is in between , and for that i am thankful .

1|"look back at all the times in your life when there was a fork in the path to the future .  some sort of decision had to be made , and , for better or worse , it irrevocably altered the course of your existence .  >from time-to-time , everyone thinks about the roads not taken , and how things might have turned out if the choice had been different .  perhaps even more dizzying to contemplate is how a seemingly minor action -- catching the 10 am train , for example -- could have an equally profound , yet less obvious , impact .  maybe that's where you met your significant other , and , had you reached the platform just a few seconds later ?  film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else , and that's why there's no shortage of movies about this subject .  the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski , who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance .  these themes weave their way through many of his movies , including decalogue , the double life of veronique , and the triptych of blue , white , and red .  however , they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance , where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action ( missing or catching a train ) changes the course of his life .  in his autobiography , kieslowski on kieslowski , the director describes his attraction to the concept this way : "" [the idea is] rich and interesting ? that every day we're faced with a choice which could end our entire life yet of which we're completely unaware . ""  while this approach has been the fodder for several notable dramatic films ( including , in a way , frank capra's it's a wonderful life ) , sliding doors is the first romantic comedy to plumb its depths .  the "" road not taken "" approach isn't just a plot device , either .  writer/director peter howitt expands upon both possible fates of a character after she just misses/catches a train .  the audience watches , with ever-growing fascination , how this one event impacts upon every aspect of her life : her future career , where she lives , whom she loves , and whether she has a family .  as her separate destinies diverge and then re-converge , she becomes two completely different individuals .  that woman is helen , played by gwyneth paltrow as a long , dark- haired brit .  one day , after losing her job as an advertising executive , she decides to return home in the middle of the day .  the scene of the pivotal moment is a train platform .  in scenario #1 , she just slips through the sliding doors before the train pulls out of the station .  on board , she meets the cheerful , talkative james ( john hannah ) , a monty python fan who is taken with her beauty .  minutes later , in her flat , she walks in on her lover , gerry ( john lynch ) , in bed with another woman ( jeanne tripplehorn ) .  in scenario #2 , she misses the train and , shortly thereafter , is the victim of an attempted mugging .  she doesn't meet james and fails to make it home in time to discover gerry's infidelity .  juxtaposed one against the other , while sharing many places , cues , and characters , the two stories proceed in parallel from there .  on one level , for viewers who enjoy pondering the workings of fate , sliding doors can be viewed as a deep and wonderful experience .  but , for those who just appreciate a romantic comedy characterized by solid acting , a script with a few twists , and a great deal of genuinely funny material , sliding doors still fits the bill .  one of its most obvious strengths is that it can satisfy many different types of audiences -- those who demand something substantial from their motion pictures , and those who could care less .  it shouldn't come as any surprise that the acting , at least from three of the four leads , is solid .  paltrow , who does double duty as two helens who are initially the same , yet gradually become much different , is the standout .  she plays both of her roles effectively and believably -- the shy , insecure woman who stays with gerry and the liberated , platinum-blond who severs the ties to her old life and embarks on a new career with a new man .  john hannah , known to most american viewers as the younger gay character in four weddings and a funeral , is instantly likable .  john lynch , taking a break from movies about ireland's troubles , does a good job presenting gerry as a inept , selfish philanderer .  only jeanne tripplehorn , who plays an over-the-top vixen , seems out of place .  her attempts at broad comedy are occasionally jarring , and it's occasionally difficult to see her lydia as anything more than a plot element .  one member of the supporting cast deserves special notice .  douglas mcferran , who plays gerry's best friend , russell , is an absolute delight , stealing every scene that he's in .  part of this is surely because he is given the best lines in the movie .  on one occasion , he has a marvelous monologue bemoaning how advances in the telecommunications industry have trapped men into a life of monogamy .  on another occasion , while laughing at gerry's plight with the women in his life , he comments , "" being with you makes the wait for the next episode of seinfeld more bearable . ""  but it's not all in the dialogue .  mcferran tears into this part with relish ; his performance becomes one of the most memorable aspects of a top-notch comedy .  this is the first feature film for peter howitt , and he approaches the task with unimpeachable aplomb .  the script is shrewd and inventive , combining wit , romance , and intelligent melodrama into a crowd-pleasing whole .  sliding doors grants more than just a good time at the movies , however .  for those who are so inclined , its central theme offers an opportunity to ponder some of the more philosophical questions about the workings of the universe -- all while having a good time .
