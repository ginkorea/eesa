what a cast .  ok here is the plot in this movie : linda fiorentino plays a regular woman who works at an abortion clinic .  one day at her house metatron ( the voice of god ) appears at her house much to her surprise and tells her that she must stop two fallen angels ( matt damon and ben affleck ) from getting back into heaven by ways of a church .  ok now get this , she is told to find two prophets : one who talks a lot and one who doesn't , however she gets jay and silent bob instead ( who give us great performances ) .  now on her way to new jersey with jay and silent bob to try and stop the two angels the 13th apostle falls out of the sky ( chris rock ) and helps guide her to find these angels .  salma hayek plays serendipity who also helps her out along her way .  azrael ( jason lee ) who is a demon is trying to help the two angels out so that they can win .  bethany ( linda fiorentino ) has to now use the help of all these people to try and stop the angels before they cheat their way back to heaven leading to a violent and bloody end that will make you think twice about your faith .  what a movie , it is everything rolled into one : an offensive , offbeat , smart and sassy comedy that surprisingly has a great message at the end , and ends up being a feel-good movie .  who would have known kevin had such a soft side on him that could make us know that he is a faithful person himself .  now for those of you who get offended with this movie really should not take it to heart .  yes it may target the catholic community and bash them a lot , but it also seems to rather than go against god and heaven , it actually goes with god and kevin gives a message that there is a god .  this review may sound confusing at first but really the only way to understand it is to see this excellent movie .  kevin goes to new lengths in this hilarious comedy and gives us some great characters with not too much background or study and rather we start to know the characters as we watch the movie .  of course the best ( and funniest ) of them all is the only duo in history that have made me fall out of my chair laughing and that my friends are jay and silent bob .  probably the best characters in movies that i like .  the star-studded cast is amazing and has some other cameos by george carlin , jeanne garafolo and so may more that we start to lose track after a while .  the script was written by kevin smith with many f'words in there of course and a strong emphasis on sexual talk but he also seems to concentrate on what is important rather that what isn't and makes us laugh at the same time as we think .  chris rock gives a hilarious performance and gets into his character very well , with some classic lines .  linda fiorentino is just perfect for her role and makes us believe that she really is who she is .  of course jason mewes and kevin smith do a great job as jay and silent bob with some priceless lines from jay ( as well as silent bob ) .  alan rickman , jason lee , salma hayek round out the cast with matt damon and ben affleck in the starring roles .  being oscar winners for the classic 'good will hunting' they give great performances here again but matt damon seems just a little held back and to me did not give it all he could .  ben however was all out and got very much into his character as well as the story .  the movie's only big flaw is that it has a few unfunny lines and some slow parts to go along with it .  however the direction by kevin and the script by kevin as well as the priceless performance by many of the cast members , 'dogma' stands as a new classic and i think i can safely compare it to 'clerks' .  while being funny at times , in the end it becomes a serious movie with an important message that some may not agree with but can't deny it .  'dogma' will offend people , especially deeply religious people , but for those of you who are open minded and want to see some very funny material then this is the movie for you .  all kevin smith fans must see ! !  |0.3|0.9166666666666666|0.8500000000000001|The overall sentiment is positive, with reviewers expressing enthusiasm for the film's humor, smart dialogue, surprising serious undertone, and star-studded cast.

1|one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel .  that concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century .  however , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences .  the author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour .  whatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages .  instead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space .  the novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration .  first of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own .  the plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time .  at the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time .  they are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future .  at first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars .  finally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions .  when he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines .  but , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld .  the time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times .  for h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie .  even the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era .  compared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films .  of course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness .  for example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today .  some of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing .  but , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture .  the acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george's trusted friend filby .  yvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role .  however , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days .  |0.4166666666666667|0.8000000000000002|0.8833333333333333|"The sentiment of the explanations is generally positive, emphasizing the popularity and influence of time travel in science fiction, the success of H.G.

1|"if this keeps up , jane austen ( sense and sensibility , pride and prejudice ) may have to apply for posthumous membership to the screen writers guild .  yet another novel of hers has made the transition to the silver screen .  mansfield park is a turn of the century ( 18th century going on 19th ) story about love among the classes as well as an examination into proper society and family ties .  ten year old fanny price ( hannah taylor-gordon , jakob the liar ) , taken from her mother and father and the poverty in which they dwell , is sent to live with her aunt and the privileged class at mansfield park , under the stern patriarchal hand of her uncle , sir thomas bertram ( harold pinter , mojo )  spending her days reminded of her lower status , she also invents and writes fanciful stories during her private times .  fanny eventually grows to become a beautiful , intelligent , and engaging heroine ( quite unlike the original character which ms . austen originally penned in her novel . )  writer/director patricia rozema ( when night is falling ) is responsible for the textual changes .  from a purely dramatic perspective , the revision makes perfect sense and improves the film's audience appeal .  what ms . rozema has done is to infuse the main character with much of ms . austen's own personality by including excerpts from the author's journals , giving that dialogue to fanny .  the result is a central character that is immediately appealing .  as the grown fanny , australian actress frances o'connor ( all about adam ) does wonderfully textured work .  at times , ms . rozema has fanny address the camera directly to communicate many of the novel's more introspective observations .  this is a difficult device to work seamlessly into a period film and it is to ms . o'connor's credit that it works as well as it does .  the central theme which gives the story its legs in an old one . . .  whether it is better to marry for love or for social standing ?  fanny has fallen in love with her cousin edmund ( jonny lee miller , plunkett & macleane ) who appears fond of her as well .  his attentions are soon divided as the stylish and socially acceptable mary crawford ( embeth davidtz , bicentennial man ) enters the picture along with her equally acceptable brother henry ( alessandro nivola , inventing the abbotts ) who eventually sets his romantic sights upon fanny .  while mary and henry are evidently less than sincere in their affections , their presence does provide the movie and the main characters with the necessary conflict that keeps our interest until the film's appropriately austen-like ending .  other thematic devices include a awkwardly inserted reference to the source of the wealth of mansfield park . . .  the slave trade .  there is also a hint of both lesbianism and incest but neither is carried very far and is soon forgotten .  the motivation for marriage remains the primary thematic thrust .  fanny's cousin , maria bertram ( victoria hamilton , persuasion ) is an example of one making a poor match , marrying a well-to-do fool who is able to make her comfortable , but never happy .  fanny's own mother , trapped in her chosen life of squalor warns fanny by admitting that her situation is due to the fact that she "" married for love . ""  fanny , given those two terrible examples , and faced with the same choice is understandably indecisive as to which way to lean .  the spiritual answer , of course , lies in the middle of those two extremes .  marriage is not a cold , calculating decision based upon self-preservation .  neither is it a senseless decision made in the warm afterglow of a passionate embrace .  in the purest sense , marriage forms an insoluble union whereby two people agree to function as one .

1|saving private ryan ( dreamworks ) running time : 2 hours 48 minutes .  starring tom hanks , edward burns , tom sizemore and matt damon directed by steven spielberg already being hailed as the 'greatest war movie ever made , ' saving private ryan is an harrowing , saddening and riveting movie .  it may not be the greatest war movie in my opinion , but it's certainly one of the best war movies made , and one of the best of 1998 .  tom hanks stars as a captain who's troop has to find private ryan ( damon ) who has a ticket home because his three brothers have been killed in action .  action , drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him .  after the disappointing amistad ( 1997 ) spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie .  i'm not the war movie genre biggest fan , but i found this film to be gripping , and very scary , thanks to the excellent cast , direction and terrifying battle scenes .  tom hanks is superb , straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles , such as in forrest gump ( 1994 ) .  this time , he plays the role with gritty realism , and is much better for it .  occasionally he overacts the sentimentally , but he generally delivers a fine performance .  edward burns , looking a lot like armageddon's ben affleck , also delivers a top notch performance , moving away from his roles in films such as she's the one ( 1996 ) tom sizemore makes less of an impact , but is still watchable , and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today .  spielberg directs very well , putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes .  and what battle scenes they are !  they're truly terrifying , yet the audience cannot drag their eyes away from the screen .  the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand-held camera , and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique .  the gore and violence isn't spared either , which body parts flying , and blood spurting .  this film is certainly not for kids and sensitive adults .  other factors help saving private ryan be a masterpiece of 90's film making .  the cinematography is excellent , and the music score by john william's is also superb .  it is never intrusive , and adds to the drama on-screen .  but while they are thousands of good things great about private ryan , there's one major flaw that detracts the genius of the film : the writing .  it is unusually flat , with many of the speeches strangely weak .  the film never really makes any profound statements .  this is not a major gripe , as private ryan is a film of action , not words .  still , the script could of been a lot better .  thankfully , the actors help partly to rectify the situation with their great delivery of their lines .  saving private ryan , in the end , is an excellent film , but not the 'greatest war movie' due to it's weak acting .  this film should be viewed by everyone who has the stomach for it , as it's rewarding and extremely worthwhile .  it really shouldn't be missed , and dreamworks skg has finally found it's first hit movie .  |0.7000000000000001|0.8833333333333333|0.7666666666666666|The overall sentiment of the explanations is highly positive, as the reviews praise the film as one of the best war movies with an excellent cast, direction, and terrifying battle scenes, despite some criticism of the weak writing.
1|50's `aliens vs .  earth' idea revamped !  if you have been following the movie news over the net , you could not have escaped the hype over id4 .  it promises to be the summer film of the year and it has all the elements necessary .  id4 opened in the us on 2nd of july , and up till now , only after a week of release , it has nearly touched the us$100 million mark , a phenomenon last observed when jurassic park was released back in 1993 .  the premise of the movie is disgustingly simple : earth defends itself against the aliens , a typical and highly popular 50's hollywood theme which manifested itself in many films produced in that era .  the movie opens via star wars , however unoriginal it may be , it worked .  the aliens have sent a large mother ship ( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon ) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth .  the us president ( pullman ) does not know of the aliens' intention but soon finds out when david ( goldblum ) a scientist , discovers that the aliens are counting down to a synchronised attack on all the major cities .  capt . hiller ( smith ) , a hot-shot f-18 pilot are one of the hundreds assigned to take out the hovering alien attack ship over washington dc .  his squadron came under heavy alien fire after discovering that their weapons were useless against the invaders , he crash lands after a spectacular 1-on-1 chase over the grand canyon , one of the many highlights of the movie .  id4 features many characters and we are shown the impact on them as the story progresses .  acting on the whole was ok although i thought that bill pullman was a bit unsuitable for the president role but he did make a very rousing speech before sending his troops into battle ( do we smell a bit of braveheart here ? ? ) .  no prizes for guessing how id4 ends , its just plain obvious .  id4 borrows heavily from star wars , return of the jedi , alien and in some parts of the movie , i could even sense a bit of x-files on screen .  if i were to critically review this movie , id4 is full of plot holes , corny dialogue , and ridiculously dumb aliens .  however below that wafer-thin plot and on-screen flaws , id4 scored well in playing with the appealing idea of the entire world giving up their petty differences to unite themselves as one force against the alien invasion .  an idea which will have the audience strongly rooting for the united front throughout the movie , thus maintaining a screen-viewer interaction that virtually render any holes in the movie acceptable , no matter how ridiculous .  id4 was produced under a modest budget of us$68 million , a film of such magnitude would have easily been another waterworld but director roland emmerich ( universal soldier , stargate ) and producer dean devlin assembled a team which did their own special effects rather than commissioning it to ilm or any other special effects company .  some of the effects are not too good but most of it are very believable , especially the epic standoff between 150 f-18's and 250 alien saucers , reminiscence of the classic space battle featured in return of the jedi .  id4 is a movie for all .  though there are many explosions and implied deaths , there are no gory scenes of human destruction , thus young kids should be able to take it .  sit back and don't be too critical , chances are you will be absorbed into the movie just as i was .  if you are not planning to watch any movies this year , please , at least make time for this one .  this film is best watched on the big-screen .  |0.39999999999999997|0.7666666666666666|0.7666666666666666|"The overall sentiment is positive, with the reviewer praising the movie ""id4"" as a successful summer film that appeals to audiences, particularly highlighting the idea of the world uniting against the alien invasion.

1|"the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily .  three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making .  they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house .  from there , things become a little more complicated .  i can say , with absolute assurance , that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me .  although i know it was all a staged "" mockumentary "" , there's no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you .  i didn't feel much upon initially watching it .  i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts .  i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend .  i've gotten chills every time i've brought it up since then .  this is not a movie that hits you right away .  instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine , waits until you think everything is okay , then it slowly starts to creep it's way up into your mind .  this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch .  the film is comprised of home video and 16mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film , so don't expect any steadi-cam shots or fancy camera work .  this is as real as it gets folks .  i don't recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though , because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera .  the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real , you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not .  this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing , especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera .  the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape-to-film transfer done for the big screen .  word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras ( hours of deleted scenes , alternate endings , commentary , the sci-fi channel special , and others ) is being planned for release .  i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to rival all dvd's .  i know i'll be first in line to buy one .

1|"apocalypse now , based on the novel "" hearts of darkness "" , is an extremely striking , gripping , and horrifying depiction of the vietnam war from another angle .  a long debate has surrounded this movie as if it is actually an anti-war film .  in many ways , this debate could go either way .  apocalypse now is probably one of the most memorable vietnam war films ever made .  in addition , now film has gone to the extremes that this film does - a disturbing look at the corruption and terrifying effects of the most devastating war of recent years .  apocalypse now follows the mission captain benjamin l . willard , played by martin sheen , to seek out and eliminate colonel walter e . kurtz , a green beret who is thought to have gone insane and set up his own militant base in cambodia .  captain willard is ordered to assassinate kurtz with "" extreme prejudice "" because he has been deemed a murderer .  willard accepts his mission , but not while pondering the accusation .  accusing someone of murder in this situation is like "" handing out speeding tickets at the indy 500 "" , as he puts it .  it doesn't make too much sense .  escorting him on his mission are a group of men who operate a riverboat .  the men are chef ( frederic forrest ) , chief ( albert hall ) , lance johnson ( sam bottoms ) and mr . clean ( a fifteen year-old laurence fishburne ) .  willard is ordered not to let them know exactly what his mission is , but they all know it is something big .  the men encounter many exciting , dangerous and bizarre situations .  but no situation is more bizarre than the infamous napalm scene with a very eccentric robert duvall as lieutenant colonel kilgore .  kilgore decides to attack and overtake a certain beach area so that his men can surf .  surf .  this is all inspired when kilgore is able to meet the famed california surfer lance johnson .  duvall's portrayal as lieutenant colonel kilgore is terrific , and , he provides a number of memorable quotes .  eventually , captain willard encounters colonel kurtz's frightening community full of strange things everywhere you look , especially his followers .  one of his main followers is a freelance photographer ( dennis hopper ) who attempts to convey the situations to willard .  but willard cannot understand the madness that encompasses the colony .  kurtz is actually well aware of willard's mission , and refers to him as "" an errand boy sent by grocery clerks to collect a bill "" .  yet willard is intent on completing his mission , no matter what shocking things kurtz does .  apocalypse now , possibly one of the greatest films ever made , is a stunning vision into the madness that corresponds to the vietnam war .  a movie that will hypnotize you with it's brilliant cinematography , apocalypse now is an outstanding epic drama about the controversial and horrifying ravages of war .  definitely on the "" do not miss "" list .  be prepared for a very memorable film .

1|"sometimes i find 19th century british costume dramas a little hard to relate to .  it's not the time or the distance , it's the rules and conventions of a social class that deserves resentment rather than sympathy .  yet somehow , the movies are all well made and i always get caught up in the story .  the wings of the dove fits the pattern .  kate ( helena bonham carter ) and merton ( linus roache ) are in love .  merton , a newspaper writer , would like to marry kate .  but kate's "" job "" , if you will , is to be a member of the british upper class .  her father lost all of her family's money , but a wealthy aunt agreed to take care of her until she married a nice rich man .  naturally , a newspaper writer's wages don't count as "" rich . ""  kate leads him on , but she always ends up giving him the cold shoulder , ultimately because he's not marriageable .  kate's american friend millie ( alison elliot ) stops in for a visit on her way to venice .  at a party , millie catches a glimpse of merton and likes what she sees .  kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie , he might forget about her .  it appears that she is trying to spare him from the heartbreak of their inevitable breakup .  merton sees what kate is doing and resents her for it .  he is still in love with kate , and will accept no substitute .  the three of them , along with a fourth friend ( elizabeth mcgovern ) end up on holiday in venice together , where their interactions are quite complicated .  let's sum up : millie has fallen for merton .  merton has no feelings for millie because he is still in love with kate .  kate loves him but can't marry him , so on the one hand she's trying to match him up with someone who will make him happy , but on the other hand she's jealous of them as a couple .  a clear solution presents itself to kate when she realizes that millie is very sick - dying , in fact .  at this point she decides that merton should marry millie until she dies .  millie will leave her money to merton , who will then be rich enough to marry kate .  she lets merton know of her schemes and , since it will help him win kate , he reluctantly agrees .  kate leaves venice so that the two m's can be alone together .  merton finds that pretending to love millie is a lot like actually loving her .  he's not sure he can separate the two .  kate finds that she's not so sure she really wants her merton falling in love with and marrying anyone else .  the brilliant scheme proves to be painful to all involved .  without revealing the details , suffice it to say that the situation ends badly .  the title refers to the object of merton's vain hope that something might lift him from his predicament .  one is left with feelings of regret and despair .  what started as such a promising relationship was damaged by greed , anger , and jealousy .  an interesting thought struck me after the movie was over , and that is that the wings of the dove almost fits the story line of a film noir .  a couple conspires to cheat someone out of their money so they can live happily ever after .  their involvement in the deception makes each less attractive to the other , and after a few things go wrong , the whole idea seems like an awful life-ruining mistake .  i wouldn't call the wings of the dove a film noir , but the comparison is interesting .  as i have acknowledged before , i am not a wonderful judge of acting , but i liked the performances from roache and elliot .  roache successfully conveyed his character's ambivalence toward millie : near the end , he hugs her , at first staring into space , as if he's thinking about his plan with kate , then giving that up to fully embrace millie .  millie's part didn't require as much range , but elliot gave her the necessary bubbly personality that made her irresistible .  i will probably file away the wings of the dove in the same low-traffic corner of my mind as sense and sensibility and persuasion .  their settings are far removed from my personal experience - geographically , historically , and socially .  still , the movies are well made and the stories inevitably win me over .

1|earlier this year , the movie holy man opened to a meager box office receipt and to indifference from audiences and critics .  a real charmer of a movie , it's possible that the subject matter was too hip or trendy to attract any real audience .  now , at the end of 1998 , comes waking ned devine , a comedy which inspires the same vein of easygoing laughter .  there's no substantial difference between the two other than a more refined atmosphere -- they strike all the same chords -- but still , ned devine is a movie worth seeing .  the plot is interesting and robust : the latest lottery winner is ned devine ( jimmy keogh ) , of tullymore , ireland .  ned's prize is over six million pounds , but the shock of winning killed the poor old man , and the check remains unclaimed .  enter jackie o'shea ( ian bannen ) and michael o'sullivan ( david kelly ) , the only two residents who are aware the winner is in their village .  the two men eventually find the ticket , and decide that if michael can convince the lotto authorities that he's actually ned , the entire town can reap the benefits ; their only adversary is an ancient old woman ( eileen dromey ) who sees more profit in reporting the fraud .  ian bannen and david kelly truly shine as jackie and michael .  jackie , stocky and large , is the brains behind the operation ; michael , scrawny and short , is the method man .  the two contrast each other delightfully , and at the same time remain sympathetic to the audience .  every viewer is sure to like both of them .  there are other minor subplots included as well , such as an unlikely romance between a local girl and the town pig farmer .  this appears quite inconsequential until the end , and even with a startling revelation it's a tad bit unnecessary .  overall , waking ned devine has a predictable outcome , and plot twists are never really taken seriously .  the ending , a very hilarious and very ironic twist of fate , somehow fits with the twisted sense of humor the movie exhibits throughout .  the kirk jones script is indeed off-the-cuff .  in a way , waking ned devine is exactly like the class of people it presents : warm , friendly , outgoing , and jovial .  it's the perfect kind of comedy , a real gem of a tale that sets up a trivial plot outline by which to introduce a sympathetic cast of characters and a string of jokes .  there's nothing remotely serious or grounded for more than a moment or two , because the spirit of ned devine is a lighthearted one .  indeed , it's one of the year's best feel-good movies -- 91 minutes of unrestrained joy that no one should miss .  |0.7513333333333335|0.8966666666666666|0.8766666666666666|"The overall consensus is that the movie ""Waking Ned Devine"" is a positive, charming, and funny film with great performances, an interesting plot, and a warm, friendly, and upbeat tone.

1|"just in time for halloween and christmas , the reissue of the nightmare before christmas couldn't be more appropriate .  with all of the attention thrown to "" family films "" in recent years , namely those starring pocket monsters and nickelodeon characters , it's high time we raised the intellectual level of children's fare as well as the animation achievements of the movie studios .  with that in mind , it was refreshing to revisit an animation classic on the big screen that still retains the originality and freshness it had seven years ago .  nightmare is the story of one man's quest to discover his true purpose in life -- to look beyond the accolades of his peers , the achievements of his years , and the praise of his ego .  jack skellington , the pumpkin king of halloweentown , is the main dude behind the halloween holiday for kids everywhere .  but during his reign as pumpkin king , jack has somehow lost his understanding of his place in the world and the magic he creates with his halloween holiday .  after the completion of one particular halloween season , jack walks with a heavy heart and ends up discovering in the woods outside halloweentown a grove of trees with doors to all of the other holidays in the world .  imagine his surprise to discover christmastown , a far more impressive and uplifting holiday than halloween , surrounded by happy elves making toys , and with good cheer all around .  upon his return to halloweentown , jack decides to combine halloween and christmas together by kidnapping "" sandy claws , "" employing all the residents of halloweentown to build toys for children .  he then aims to take over the role as primary joy-provider and gift-bearer to the children of the world , in the hopes of rediscovering the zest for life he once had .  alas , the co-mingling of halloween and christmas creates disastrous results involving shrunken heads , psychotic wooden ducks , a sleigh pulled by a phantom dog with a lighted nose , and a large , sinister , singing bag named oogie boogie  tim burton -- the man behind such great films as ed wood , beetlejuice , pee-wee's big adventure , and edward scissorhands -- is the creative force behind nightmare .  originally , burton authored a poem that became the basis of the storyline , and he was jointly involved in the production design of the film ( though many mistakenly assume he directed the picture ) .  the stamp of burton is clearly everywhere in the film -- with bold colors , imaginative character design , and it's simple yet compelling story .  the direction of harry selick , who also directed james and the giant peach , is strong , offering intimate views of the strange collection of characters .  also memorable are the songs in the film , written by former oingo boingo lead singer danny elfman , the next john williams of film composing .  the nightmare before christmas is intended for both the kid and adult in everyone .  it's not just child's play for the holidays ; it's a movie about how to be truly happy in a tough world , saying that all you need to do is just be exactly who you are , without compromise .  what better message is there for christmas ?

1|in the grand scheme of mel gibson movies , payback was better than conspiracy theory , but not as good as braveheart or lethal weapon .  in other words , it's a decent couple of hours of entertainment , but 20 years from now if a they compile a list of mel gibson's greatest hits , payback probably won't be on it .  gibson plays a crook who gets double crossed by his partner after they heist a payroll .  mel's partner needed the money to pay off a mob debt .  so he puts a couple of bullets in mel , leaving him for dead , and goes on to pay off his creditors .  but , mel isn't dead ( it would be a real short movie if he was ) and he certainly isn't happy .  to make matters worse , he wants his money back and is willing to go to any lengths to accomplish this feat .  his ex partner has already used it to pay off the mobsters , so mel goes after the mob to get it back .  payback is often a very violent film .  to its credit , there are a few scenes that could have been very graphic , but the director ( i'm not sure which one -- more about that in a second ) made the choice to let the audience use their imagination instead of subjecting us to the usual gratuitous gore found in many films .  the film appears a bit disjointed in places , which is understandable considering producer / star gibson wasn't thrilled with how the film turned out and wanted parts of it re-shot .  when the director refused , another one was brought in to do the re-shoot .  so as a result while the final product is apparently better than the original ( although personally i would love to see the original version for comparisons sake ) it does get a bit of a choppy feel to it towards the end .  it's always tough to make a film where the main character is a villain , unless that person has some redeeming qualities .  in this case , gibson's character has few redeeming qualities .  but hey , its mel , so even when he is killing people in cold blood we are still rooting for him .  my guess is that if that you put some other johnny bananas actor in this role , the audience would not be quite as responsive .  gibson is gibson , whether he is playing a suicidal cop or a stone cold killer , he does a good job .  he almost guarantees that no matter what else happens in the rest of the movie at least the audience is going to get one good performance .  this time out mel is surrounded by a good supporting cast , including maria bello ( as his love interest ) , william devane and kris kristofferson ( as mod bosses ) .  the man who steals the show and unfortunately doesn't have a real big part is james coburn ( as yet another mobster ) .  if i had one big disappointment in this film , it would be that coburn didn't have a bigger role .  in the end , payback is a fairly solid action thriller , just not in quite the same league as some of mel gibson's other work .  |0.2333333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.7666666666666666|"Overall, the explanations provide a slightly positive sentiment towards the movie ""Payback,"" praising Mel Gibson's performance and acknowledging it as a decent source of entertainment.

1|"the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of "" leila , "" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features .  although unfamiliar with mehrjui's previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers .  set in modern-day iran , "" leila "" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) .  as leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn't quite as sweet .  earlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child .  when all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn't care at all about having children .  nonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) .  bluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with .  leila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn't give her full blessing .  there are no easy answers to be found within "" leila , "" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character's unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration .  almost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law's requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman .  maybe because "" leila "" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence .  leila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances .  one of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply .  it is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible .  although seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another .  ditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her .  these "" small "" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman .  left there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer .  refusing to stay over at her parent's house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below .  despite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him .  sure , the whole second marriage was his mother's idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn't he ?  in the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair .  unlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words .  every bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else .  for all of its strong aspects , "" leila "" isn't a perfect film .  on a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed .  and concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before .  mehrjui's decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi .  despite these minor missteps , "" leila "" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york's cinema village , and then on may 21 in la .  the thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila's self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return .  it's difficult to not consider how leila's culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through .

1|"it's an interesting premise .  our reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real .  in truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains .  what we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence .  our bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet .  the sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along .  the matrix isn't it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one's brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) .  what is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking .  keanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines .  the group's leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is "" the one "" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence .  >from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out .  this , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun .  what is reality ?  what is a sham ?  the film turns our very perception of life on its side .  more than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings .  as viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo .  and who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ?  reeves , whom i've never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety .  he was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds .  neo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught .  in a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski .  i mean , since bill and ted's excellent adventure , what movie could you say really "" utilized "" keanu reeves ?  more interesting than reeves is fishburne , who's morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so .  very surprising for a sci-fi movie .  fishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect .  this helps to further the aura of his character's proficiency and extensive knowledge .  hugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence's anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time .  unfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character's speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive .  carrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus's number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo .  although her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn't in the picture .  there were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects .  many methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics .  of special note is the use of the "" freeze and turn "" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle .  this is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends .  the motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once .  place each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second .  pretty slick .  the matrix drips with style .  from the clothing to the music to the action , we're watching an exaggerated version of what we're used to .  much of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there's a lot of kung fu , there's a lot of gunplay .  when a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion .  there's also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects .  combined , it's really like no live-action film i have ever seen .  the film is not without its faults .  some of the scenes and ideas are "" borrowed "" a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing .  some of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn't meant to be a joke .  however , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain .

1|"i want to correct what i wrote in a former retrospective of david lean's war picture .  i still think that it doesn't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute's list of the 100 greatest american movies .  and i think that lumet's "" 12 angry men "" , wilder's "" witness for the prosecution "" and kubrick's "" paths of glory "" would have been better choices for the best picture oscar in 1958 .  but i can't deny the importance of "" the bridge on the river kwai "" - cinematically and in its contents .  the film is set in burma in 1943 .  a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai .  but the british commanding officer , colonel nicholson ( alec guinness ) , insists - corresponding to the geneva conventions - that his officers needn't work as simple workmen .  struggling toughly , col . nicholson forces the japanese commandant , col . saito ( sessue hayakawa ) , to give way in this respect .  afterwards col . nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge .  he considers it an opportunity to raise his men's morale , and he wants to prove superior british capabilities to the japanese .  but the british high command sends a few soldiers who shall destroy the bridge , among them the american shears ( william holden ) - an escapee from the japanese prison camp - and the british major warden ( jack hawkins ) . . .  a flaw of the picture is the clich ? d characterization of the japanese people .  they are presented as if they were intellectually inferior to the british - as if the japanese were incapable of building a bridge .  and the film doesn't consistently question the military spirit as kubrick does in "" paths of glory "" .  lean seems rather fascinated by the military hierarchies .  this is also perceptible in the conversations between col . nicholson and col . saito .  in this regard it is symptomatic that shears , who doubts the military logic , is a somehow unpleasant person in the film .  the audience is supposed to applaud col . nicholson's perseverance concerning the question if his officers shall work on the bridge or not .  the spectators are supposed to neglect the risks col . nicholson takes for his men .   ( the plot by-passes these risks . )  that means , the picture isn't perfect .  but it has a lot of virtues as well .  it shows the "" madness "" of war and what war can produce in people's minds .  it shows how col . nicholson becomes possessed by the idea of being a hero and that others ( like shears ) get cynics .  and "" the bridge on the river kwai "" is an interesting study of characters with clashing interests .  these points and the sometimes ironic dialogue make this film an anti-war film ( despite the inconsistencies in the treatment of this theme ) .  david lean's effective and atmospherically perfect direction creates a high suspense , especially in the dramatic ( though not wholly plausible ) showdown .  alec guinness does a magnificent job of bringing col . nicholson to life and making him such an interesting character .  the other actors deliver very good performances as well .  jack hildyard's fine color cinematography and the apt score are also helpful .  i like this extraordinary film despite its weaknesses .

1|of the major horror sub-genres , vampire movies are easily the most adaptable .  think about it .  frankenstein movies haven't changed all that much because they still need that mad-scientist-in-bavarian-castle setting .  if you made a frankenstein movie today , you'd have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j . fox , there aren't any actors that could play a virus convincingly .  movies about mummies would still have to be set in egypt .  there's not much you can do with werewolves except take them to london or paris , unless you want to have a teenage werewolf or something .   ( and there's that michael j . fox thing again . )  but you can have vampires do anything , and you can place them in any genre you want , just about .  you can have traditional vampire movies ( bram stoker's dracula ) or have the anne rice version ( interview with the vampire ) , or play it for laughs ( vampire in brooklyn ) .  you can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california ( the lost boys ) to squalid mexican dives ( from dusk till dawn ) to your local high school ( buffy , the vampire slayer ) .  were it not redundant , you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires .  any day now , i expect we'll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record .  or , you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that , you get blade .  wesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent , expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path .  in this case , the everything happens to be vampires that explode into cgi shards instead of dead , bleeding corpses .  snipes has less to say here than as the fugitive in u . s . marshals , but does a demonstrably better job here as a half-vampire wreaking vengeance on the bloodsuckers .  blade is a silent , brooding presence , laying waste to vampires without a shred of remorse .  he is as cold as his silver-bladed sword , as single minded as his garlic-filled bullets .  yet , he's not without quirks : blade drives a battered muscle car and has to glean rolex watches from his vampire victims in order to stay solvent .  like any good hong kong movie , blade is heavy on the chopsocky action .  for some reason , blade spends a lot more time using his kung fu artistry than using the traditional anti-vampire weapons of garlic and silver .   ( blade dismisses a man-portable arc lamp as being too heavy , although it looks to be a more efficient tool to dispatch vampires . )  unfortunately , the guiding hand of john woo is absent from this film , relegating blade to the status of the replacement killers , which it most strongly resembles .  the replacement killers is the last movie i saw that i didn't review -- mostly because it made no impression on me , and i couldn't remember anything other than noise , violence , and the intensity of fat's performance .  blade has a little more going for it , and has the vampire myth to draw from -- but other than that , it's the same kind of movie -- exciting , with well choreographed action scenes , but with no resonance .  with a stronger villain ( stephen dorff is ( pardon the pun ) curiously bloodless as the head vampire , leaving us to wonder what denis leary might have done with the role ) , a wittier script , and a strong supporting cast , blade might have been able to rise beyond the level of commonplace summer entertainment .  as it is , blade is an average action movie that serves to do nothing but remind us that the summer movies just keep getting dumber and the vampire movies just keep multiplying .  |0.016666666666666663|0.8333333333333334|0.7833333333333333|The overall sentiment of the text is slightly negative, as it mentions the redundancy and lack of resonance in vampire movies, as well as disappointment in certain aspects of the movie.
1|"when quentin tarantino made "" pulp fiction "" , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time .  but before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to "" citizen kane "" , hear me out .  much like "" citizen kane "" , "" pulp fiction "" has changed movie making forever .  but i think the latter has had a tad more impact .   "" pulp fiction "" has actually ushered in a new era of film making .  it has altered the way films will be viewed .   "" fiction "" has spawned so many imitations , i've lost count .  sure , some have been excellent ( "" bound "" and "" the usual suspects "" spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie-goer recognizes "" pulp fiction "" as the original neo-noir of the 90s .  in this review , i hope to change all the people's minds who have criticized it for it's excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , isn't really that graphic ) .  the most brilliant aspect of tarantino's masterpiece is the screenplay .  it is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the "" quarter pounder with cheese "" speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it isn't already .  the story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine .  the first , titled "" vincent vega and marcellus wallace's wife "" , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star-making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim's .  they talk for a while ( with the occasional "" uncomfortable silence "" ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror .  after giving marcellus' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a "" speech impediment "" .  they also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic "" you never can tell "" .  i won't reveal the rest of the story , but i'll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win .  the second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the "" die hard "" flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge .  previously in the film ( like i said , it's told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match .  as it turns out , he not only doesn't take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent .  he takes a cab to his half-witted girlfriend's apartment , and to make a long story short , ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch , sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash-back sequence .  on his way home , he bumps into ( literally ) marcellus .  the two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers , which results in the infamous "" gimp "" scene , which is very reminicent of the "" squeal like a pig ! ""  scene from "" deliverance "" .  the last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episodes features john travolta ( again ) and samuel l . jackson ( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever ) as two slightly off-kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car .  they seek help with a friend of jackson's ( played by the q-man himself ) , desperately in need of a stress ball .  they end up calling a "" cleaner "" of sorts , played by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out .  in the end , the story brilliantly loops around itself , actually ending where it began .  if you haven't already seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition .  it features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen .  earlier today , i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago .  what the pan-and-scan did to this movie is inexcusable .  that version cut out , like , half the movie .  what i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing .  for instance , when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end , the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses .  this might help explain the divine intervention that takes place .  just a theory . . .  one of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies ( i . e .   "" psycho "" "" kiss me deadly "" , "" deliverance "" , etc . ) .  but why shouldn't he ?  it's not like he out-right and blatantly stole .  give the guy a break .  in case you haven't already noticed , i believe "" pulp fiction "" is a supremely excellent film and one of the best of all time ( up there with such greats as "" casablanca "" and "" the godfather "" ) .  trust me , you will not see a better film come out of the 90s .  and besides , it's one hell of a ride .  note : if anyone knows how i could get a "" bad motherfucker "" wallet , please e-mail me .  any help would be greatly appreciated .

1|"there's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably shouldn't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did .   "" lucky numbers "" is a perfect example of this because it's such a blatant rip-off of "" fargo "" and every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet it somehow still works for me .  i know i'm in the minority here but let me explain .  the film takes place in harrisburg , pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter .  john travolta plays the local big-shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards .  russ is married to crystal ( lisa kudrow ) , a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema .  she's a selfish , nasty bitch full of lust and desire but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl - not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market .  crystal's cheating on russ with their collective boss dick ( ed o'neil ) , the tv station manager .  she doesn't seem to genuinely like either of them , but it's all she can do in this one-horse town .  much like "" fargo , "" this movie tells the story of a man who's going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick .  he enlists the help of his english friend gig ( tim roth ) , the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery .  along the way a subplot involving a two-bit thug named , accurately , "" dale the thug "" ( michael rappaport ) gets mixed up in the process .  there's also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down .  i'm not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you're not expecting .  this is a farce , which is basically a straightforward , adult-oriented comedy but doesn't go as far as a classic black comedy should .  where as "" fargo "" was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny , "" lucky numbers "" is just funny because you can't take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously .  it's all a big cartoon basically , but it's funny and i can respect that .  travolta is great in his role and even though he's not a really likable character , he's trying to be a nice guy despite the fact he's a creep .  he's like a gangster with morals who genuinely feels sorry for the guys he has to kill .  crystal is just the opposite , she's constantly arguing and using whatever brain cells she has left to look out for herself .  kudrow is perfect in this role since she's spent 8 years on tv as the dim-witted phoebe on "" friends . ""  here is character is basically a very evil incarnation of phoebe .  i have to admit i was honestly surprised and pleased by how the plot unraveled and the methods each of the main characters use to try to get their share of the money .  like "" jackie brown , "" ( an elmore leonard adaption ) , the story is about a circle of 10 characters all after the lottery money that has been won illegally .  the screenplay does a fine job in balancing the characters and slowly revealing their motivations and hidden agendas while at the same time keep russ richards the main focus .  more and more characters are introduced and since the film has such an iconic , cartoony atmosphere you can take on faith just what makes the minor characters do what they do .  the ending itself is great .  it's surprising and funny and makes you feel good .  you realize this film has packed in about 10 different movies' worth of stories into two hours' time and didn't fall apart ( although many other critics might beg to differ ) .  i liked it , and i could see it again - isn't that what makes a movie good ?

1|"this summer , one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham's series , a time to kill , was made into a major motion picture .  on january 3 of this year , director rob reiner basically re-released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi .  based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars' assassination , ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25-year legal battle faced by myrlie evars ( whoopi goldberg , sister act ) and her quest to have her husband's obvious assassin and racist byron de la beckwith ( james woods , casino ) jailed .  so she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter ( alec baldwin , heaven's prisoners ) to imprison the former kkk member .  ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from african-american history , from slave-ship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960's .  but all too soon , the white folks take over , intoning lines like "" what's america got to do with anything ?  this is mississippi !

1|"towards the middle of "" the sweet hereafter , "" a crowded school bus skids on an icy road surface as it rounds a bend , careens through the steel guard rail , and disappears out of sight .  then , in long shot , we see the vehicle slowly sliding across what looks like a snow-covered field .  it pauses for a moment before the "" field "" cracks under the bus' weight and the bright yellow vehicle vanishes in an effortless moment , a single smooth second of time .  compare that scene , if you will , to the last eighty minutes of "" titanic , "" when the behemoth sinks slowly and spectacularly to its watery demise , and you'll appreciate the futility of comparing greatness in films .  the scene in "" the sweet hereafter "" epitomizes all that's right with independent canadian director atom egoyan's film .  it's not sensational .  we don't see the inside of the bus with its payload of screaming , terrified children being bloodied and battered about .  the bus doesn't explode or break into a thousand tiny pieces .  it simply leaves the road and silently slips beneath the surface of a frozen lake .  it's a horrifying sequence made all the more so by calm and distance .  using a non-linear approach to his narrative , egoyan shifts back and forward in time , connecting us with the inhabitants of the small british columbian town who have been severely affected by this tragedy .  fourteen children died in the accident , leaving their parents and the town itself paralyzed with grief .  the catalyst at the center of the film is ambulance chaser mitchell stephens ( a wonderfully moving performance by ian holm ) , who comes to sam dent to persuade the townsfolk to engage in a class action suit .  stephens , who "" doesn't believe in accidents , "" functions as a concerned , involved observer , scribbling details in his notebook and providing the parents with an opportunity to reach some kind of closure in the harrowing aftermath .  while stephens' initial drive may be financial ( one third of the total settlement if he wins ) , his involvement provides him more with an outlet to come to grips with his own loss .  his self-destructive , drug-addicted daughter has been in and out of clinics , halfway houses and detox units for years .  egoyan's attention to detail and ability to establish mood are so impeccable that even the sound of a kettle boiling resonates like a plaintive cry .  mychael danna , who composed the shimmering music for "" the ice storm , "" contributes another memorable score that shivers and tingles .  equally impressive is paul sarossy's cinematography , capturing the imposing canadian mountainsides and low-hanging fogs as splendidly as his shadowy interiors--in one scene a bright wall calendar serves to illuminate portions of a room .   "" the sweet hereafter , "" while undeniably grim , urges the viewer to grab onto life with both hands and not let go .  it's a film of generous subtlety and emotion .
