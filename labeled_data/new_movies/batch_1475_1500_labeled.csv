0|"miramax "" disinvited "" on-line media from press screenings of scream 3 .  they ostensibly feared that folks like me would write spoiler-filled reviews and post them prior to the film's february 4th release date-unsound reasoning .  you see , 'net critics established enough to be on any sort of vip list are professionals-miramax surely knows the difference between a member of the on-line film critics society ( ofcs ) and the type of fanboy who posts spy reports at ain't it cool news .  no , the ? mini major' was afraid we'd let a bigger cat out of the bag than whodunit , that scream 3 is a dismal conclusion to the beloved ( by this writer , at least ) franchise .  something smells rotten in the state of california right from the get-go : cotton weary ( liev schrieber ) , the former lover and would-be killer of maureen prescott , sidney's mother , is juggling phone calls in his luxury car .   ( once considered a danger to society , weary now hosts his own talk show , "" 100% cotton "" , a clever , if dated , jab at american pop culture . )  of course , a new ghostface dials him up , and , with memories of scream's unbearably suspenseful prologue in mind , we immediately wonder , where is the killer ?  the backseat ?  the next car ?  thrilling prospects , to be sure , but actually , ghostface is at the weary residence , waiting for cotton's girlfriend ( kelly rutheford ) to finishing showering .  what's missing from this sequence , and indeed scream 3's remaining frights ( most disappointingly , the moment when an ingenue is forced to hide in a wardrobe room filled with ghostface costumes , one of which might spring to life ) , is an elaborate and attenuated payoff .  our other surviving regulars have become estranged .  sidney ( campbell ) is living a paranoid existence of electronic gates and password-protected locks , while dewey ( arquette ) acts as technical advisor on the second sequel to scream 2's movie-within-a-movie , "" stab 3 "" , and gale weathers ( cox arquette ) headlines a gossipy news program .  murder reunites them , as knife-wielding ghostface stalks the set of "" stab 3 "" , imitating its sadistic screenplay-and his/her/their own personal draft climaxes with sidney's death .  the appeal of ghostface's villainy is that he/she/they could be your boyfriend , your classmate , your next door neighbour . . . or a combination of people .  scream was the first of its kind : a slasher mystery , with the guessing game not only entailing who will be next , but also who is/are the perpetrator ( s ) and what is/are his/her/their motive .  ironic self-reflection aside , parts one and two stand out in a crowd that includes umpteen friday the 13th and halloween flicks because there's at last articulate human beings behind the iconic costume .  with scream 3 , the novelty of ghostface's ever-mutating identity has worn off some , but the character remains conceptually potent .  conceptually . the execution of ghostface's master plan this time around is creaky , because screenwriter ehren kruger has invented a new mythology for the world of sidney prescott far afield from what we'd come to understand in scream and scream 2 . the movie gets in the silly habit of saying "" all bets are off ! ""  in reference to the "" rules "" of a trilogy's third act , but there's a difference between rule breaking and cheating .  with the departure of kevin williamson , who authored the previous screams as well as a tidy outline for scream 3 ( that , for reasons incomprehensible to me , was ignored , save the notion of "" stab 3 "" ) , kruger needed to be reined in tighter , and by wes craven .  craven's direction of scream 3 is lazy in most respects .  how else to explain the jay and silent bob cameo ( the slacker duo of kevin smith movies ) , akin to seeing mickey mouse pop up in mulan and more distracting than funny .  it pains me to write this , but scream 3's comedy is generally laughless , with the exception of well-timed performances by josh pais ( as a police detective possessed of the same personality he had as a persnickety teacher in craven's music of the heart ) , jamie kennedy ( resurrecting film geek randy for the sendoff he was denied in scream 2 ) , and parker posey ( through sheer force of will as a b-actress ) .  the visuals are much weaker in part three , as well-the occasional sweeping gesture of peter deming's camera is a pale imitation of the stalking steadicam craven gave us twice before .   ( aside : in the wake of columbine , craven toned down the violence significantly for scream 3-why the sanctimony , when scream and scream 2 are still readily available on video store shelves ? )  finally , marco beltrami's music cues the suspense too blatantly-do you recall the tense chase at the college radio station in scream 2 ? it's mostly silent .  sting notes are a whole lot more effective if they spring from nowhere ; here , they act as the crescendos of an incessantly nerve-jangling score .  i look at scream 3 as coming from an alternative universe , the same place that birthed the godfather part iii and superman iii-woefully out of synch with its prequels , scream 3 is a nightmare instead of nightmarish , and will likely put the horror genre back in mothballs .  the film unintentionally follows the unspoken rule of a trilogy to a t : ? part three must disappoint' .

0|"a backdrop of new year's eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a great party movie .  the decor possibilities are endless - disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic , big hair was worth its weight in aquanet , and the louder the fashion , the better the look .  but despite this setting , these details and a soundtrack that includes some 40-plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade , something is inherently wrong with "" 200 cigarettes .

0|"there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors .  when i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture .  you see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries .  i hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories .  i hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac's shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey .  the badness of patch adams is stupefying .  it's confounding .  i can't believe a film can be this bad .  and yet , it's based on a real man who probably has a good point to make .  in the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human .  in the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn't want to kill himself .  while there , he notices that the doctors don't care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings .  so , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients .  he goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it's good to help people .  he also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor .  naturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams .  so patch decides that he's going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have .  and that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 .  on a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn't say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter's performance , even if she is wasted ) .  but the film fails fundamentally in execution .  every scene swells with grand , "" emotional "" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard .  take , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus .  we don't know patch yet , but there's sad music , and it's supposed to make us really sad that he's sad .  later on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively .  and when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad .  but the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions .  real drama is character-based .  you grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it .  we don't ever grow to know the dying patient ; he's simply a vehicle for patch's greatness .  real drama doesn't seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry .  that's why patch adams is not real drama .  it goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene .  even scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman's sickening musical score .  sentimentality like this is indeed bad .  but it's not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes .  you see , patch is a really great student .  he aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he's cheating .  but patch doesn't think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor .   "" why don't we see patients until the third year ? "" he bursts out every three seconds .  well , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients .  not everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort .  most of us have to study .  and a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn't know a toe from a finger , probably won't be too successful in preventing death .  oh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to "" prevent death , "" but to "" improve the quality of life ! ""  yes !  that is true !  and you can not do that without studying .  you can not do that without going to medical school .  what patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later .  follow the rules ?  bah !  who needs the rules !  only uptight doctors follow the rules .  the real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants .  and then there's the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic .  a free clinic .  in the middle of the forest .  where patients can be taken to be helped .  for free .  how will patients be transported to the free clinic ?  will it have an emergency room ?  or is it just for mental patients ?  and who , may i ask , will pay for it ?  the film does give some token attempts to question patch's motives ( i think another character asks him how he's going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don't explore or challenge patch's ideas to any meaningful extent .  reader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams .  i know nothing about him .  if his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them .  but regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony .  and in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting .  actually , robin williams does a lot of shouting .  he shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words .  i won't tell you that you can't be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words .  i was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be .  patch adams is the cheapest of them all .

0|"i have a great idea for a movie , one that can't miss .  see , i've got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack , and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances .  it's about professional basketball , so i'll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity .  as for what the movie is actually about . . . well , that will all sort itself out eventually .  i figure it will be a comedy , so i'll throw a half-dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with .  maybe we'll put a gender spin on it , see if we can get some women out to see it , too .  eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind .  twister , as inane as the script might have been , at least required some creative technicians ; mission : impossible , overwrought plot and all , at least involved genuine effort .  eddie just sits there , hawking up a formula story without any laughs , and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required .  whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin , a new york limo driver and die-hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team .  coach john bailey ( dennis farina ) has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas , and the losses are beginning to mount .  the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess ( frank langella ) to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team .  the winner ( surprise , surprise ) is eddie , who becomes a fan favorite , and eventually the actual coach .  the knicks continue to lose , but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops .  incidentally , the knicks eventually start winning .  please raise your hand if that comes as a shock , and i will invite you to my all-night marathon of the bad news bears , major league , angels in the outfield , the mighty ducks , the big green , cool runnings and little giants .  awful teams in sports comedies make miraculous turnarounds ; it's what they do .  those teams usually involve kids , for a very sound comedic reason : it's funnier when they screw up , and they're more sympathetic .  those which _don't_ involve kids usually have actual actors in the lead roles , for another very sound comedic reason : they generally have developed some sort of comic timing .  eddie was cast under the misguided premise that it's easier to make basketball players look like actors than it is to make actors look like basketball players .  this finds nba players like greg ostertag , dwayne schintzius , rick fox and malik sealy delivering punch lines as though they were reading them for the first time off a bazooka wrapper ( though sacramento kings center olden polynice has a nice moment describing a black hole to fellow players ) .  perhaps that all didn't matter to anyone because there are so few punch lines , and because the whole film is one big casting gimmick .  steve rash directs the spiritless script as though waving a flag of surrender and screaming , "" don't blame me , i just work here . ""  perhaps it was patently obvious to him that eddie isn't a movie -- it's a cameo appearance that trips over a plot every once in a while .  among the notables who lend their faces to this travesty are donald trump , new york mayor rudolph giulianni , former new york mayor ed koch , david letterman , letterman regulars mujibur rahman and sirajul islam , espn broadcaster chris berman and knicks announcer marv albert , as well as dozens of nba players and several nba arenas .  and those are the real jokes in eddie .  nothing these individuals say or do is funny ; you are supposed to be laughing simply because you notice , "" hey , it's donald trump ! ""  or "" hey , it's mujibur and sirajul ! ""  it's difficult to decide whether eddie is so bad because it was so shamelessly lacking in imagination or because it can't even get the cliches in a cliche-ridden genre script right .  the knicks coach who is eddie's antagonist early in the film reappears at the end , but he isn't given a chance to be the villain eddie desperately needs .  neither is frank langella , and none of the athlete-actors have the ability to give whoopi goldberg anything to play off of .  that leaves her to do her street-wise miss thang routine , but with no character , no sharp lines and no help .  eddie isn't just a bad movie with a formulaic premise .  it's a movie that makes you feel cheated and offended , because someone came up with a poster and a marketing plan to which they had to attach an actual movie , and you had the nerve to believe it was going to be a comedy .

0|as any reasonable human being would , i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things .  i am befuddled by fight club .  now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later , sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later .  perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time .  perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in do we truly appreciate and understand them .  fight club is either garbage or brilliant , but , at least right now , i must lean toward the former .  maybe i am subconsciously affected by word of mouth that has been slowly leaking throughout the media for weeks that this film is pure gold .  but if it is , i sure don ? t see it .  edward norton plays jack , a field examiner for a major automobile manufacturer .  his insomnia , coupled with his compulsive desires to fill his world with ikea furniture to ? complete ? himself , make him a loser at the game of life .  but when all of his worldly possessions are blown out his 15th story window , he seeks comfort in a stranger , tyler ( pitt ) whom he met on a flight home .  once jack is sucked into tyler ? s world , he can ? t get out , literally .  they begin fight club , an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging .  as the fight club grows , things get out of control and take on cult status , beginning with one future soldier who proves his worth by standing still outside tyler ? s house for three days .  i dare not even begin to bring up the last quarter of the film , since that contains the twist that ? explains ? the pointless journey .  suffice it to say i was truly disappointed in fincher , who ? s previous two films , se7en and the game put him in a very slim category of truly brilliant young filmmakers of the next generation .  this is not to imply by any means that he is no longer a genius or capable of bringing more masterpieces to the table .  but with fight club , he has allowed his unique talent for extraordinary vision to be distorted by silly digital experiments and self-referencing film elements , such as talking to the audience about what they are seeing , telling them that the little blips in the right hand corner are signifiers that the projectionist is changing reels and that a slightly altered recurring line is good ? flashback humor ? .  now , throughout the film ? s coarsely woven texture and over-extended plot lines , fight club is obviously trying to make various social comments about the state of the world today .  advertisements , inter-office politics , corporations , you name it , it ? s addressed .   ( though the media are suspiciously absent from the institutions that are referenced . )  all of them play an important role .  how so ?  well , i can kinda just tell .  i can ? t really put my finger on it .  to say that starbucks and barnes & noble are taking over their respective markets and kicking out the small business owner is no big news .  is that bad for the world ?  probably .  not much room for social commentary there .  we all know that inter-office politics are just that . . . politics .  so what was the point of all this ?  the film seems desperate to make a point , or a number of points , but i couldn ? t figure out what they were .  all i saw was a very bizarre social satire that was woven with strange film techniques , a bleak visual design and some fine acting .   ( pitt , carter , norton . . . all of them are good .  even meatloaf is good . )  when you get to the end , you will most likely be filled with questions , many of which the filmmakers wanted you to ask of yourself .  not them , because each of them would likely give you a different answer .  fight club means what you want it to mean , i think fincher just gives you the stuff to think about .  but it couldn ? t be more bizarre and unappealing .  sure , it had shock value , but so did se7en and the game , and they were significantly stronger films .  |-0.3333333333333333|0.7666666666666666|0.8000000000000002|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is that the text expresses disappointment and criticism towards the film ""Fight Club,"" particularly for its digital experiments and self-referencing elements, as well as its lack of a clear message.

0|"even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor , his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality .  like everyone else , dreyfuss has bills to pay , so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies .  consequently , while his career highlights include jaws , close encounters of the third kind , stakeout , and tin men , his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador , let it ride , and now krippendorf's tribe .  let me start out by saying that krippendorf's tribe is occasionally funny ( although never riotously so ) , but that's about its only asset .  the best word to describe this film is "" asinine . ""  the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes , which are aimed at someone going through puberty .  krippendorf's tribe tries to be a zany , off-the-wall comedy , but the film makers have forgotten three important rules .  the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist .  the second is that viewers should be able to identify with , or at least care about , a character or two .  finally , and most importantly , more than 5% of the jokes have to work .  once upon a time , james krippendorf ( dreyfuss ) was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college .  he and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a "" lost tribe "" somewhere in the wilds of new guinea , a goal which they never accomplished .  shortly after their return from the failed trip , krippendorf's wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children -- shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) , and edmund ( carl michael linder ) -- on his own .  now , over a year later , the college wants to see the results of the money they gave krippendorf ( which he has spent not on research , but on things for his family ) , so they send a new member of their faculty , professor veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , to inform him that he has been scheduled to give a lecture on his findings .  when he arrives at the college for the momentous event , rather than telling the truth and risking being sent to jail for misappropriating school funds , he fabricates a tale about a mythical lost tribe , the "" shelmikedmu "" .  to provide video footage , he films his children dressed in native garb .  soon , much to krippendorf's surprise , the shelmikedmu are a national phenomenon .  but one disaffected professor ( lily tomlin ) is determined to prove that the tribe is a fraud .  the only way krippendorf's tribe works is if you assume that all of the characters ( not to mention the viewers ) are dumber than dirt .  unfortunately , it's impossible to like or sympathize with a bunch of putzes like this .  director todd holland completely fails to develop any character into something more substantial than a device to implement various dubious gags .  meanwhile , attempts at satirizing the shallowness of american culture ( i . e . , how easily the public can be fooled into jumping on the bandwagon of the latest trend ) come across as feeble and derivative .  the acting in underwhelming .  dreyfuss has definitely not given his "" all "" to the role of james krippendorf .  alongside him , jenna elfman , the spunky co-star of tv's dharma and greg , radiates perkiness and little else .  this quality , while fine for a 22-minute television program , quickly becomes irritating in the arena of a feature-length movie .  no one in the supporting cast -- lily tomlin , david ogden stiers , natasha lyonne ( woody allen's daughter in everyone says i love you ) -- excels .  i know that a movie's in trouble when it's half the length of titanic , but seems much longer .  most of what comes on screen is generic sit-com level material -- the kind of slop that people will absorb while dozing off in their favorite easy chair in front of the television set .  if there's any upside , it's that i don't see much box-office support developing for this lame , ill-marketed miscue .  krippendorf's tribe will quickly become extinct .

0|"movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting , entertaining or convincing , because of one fundamental reason : movies are made by adults and not teenagers .  occasionally , however , films like say anything , dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called "" teenagers . ""  can't hardly wait , however , does not .  instead , the writing/directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich ? found in the teenage genre , strip it completely of perception , intelligence and wit - and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to .  can't hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation .  the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them : there's the average male protagonist preston ( ethan embry ) , prom queen and cheerleader amanda ( jennifer love-hewitt ) , football star mike ( peter facinelli ) , white rapper wannabe kenny ( seth green ) , computer geek william ( charlie korsmo ) , and brainy outsider denise ( lauren ambrose ) .  i couldn't stand any of those characters .  whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming "" yo , i gotta have sex tonight ! "" ,  all i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film .  apparently , can't hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy , but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it's not funny .  in all honesty , elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour .  and when i say "" forced "" , i mean it .  they should be strapped down to a chair and have their eyes wedged open in a similar fashion to alex in a clockwork orange .  this is how desperately they need to be educated about the concept of humour .  for instance , can't hardly wait features a foreign exchange student who is instructed to repeat absurd statements such as "" i am a sex machine . ""  for some reason , elfont and kaplan believe that if this character repeats it enough , eventually it will be funny .  if only elfont and kaplan could recognise the irony that they actually got paid for making this junk - now that's funny .

0|"way of the gun is brimming with surprises , some good , most bad .  one of the good ones is ryan phillippe's surprisingly halfway decent performance .  after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer , he hinted at a bit growth in last year's cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance , though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark , precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart ( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans ) and start bellyaching about how he'd fallen for his "" target "" .  it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film's director could negotiate .  but he seems to be trying and that shouldn't be overlooked ( or probably over praised ) seeing as how , at this point , he really isn't required to do much but look pretty .  here , phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard , his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his "" look here , see "" glory .  it's tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass , but his performance actually helps with the illusion .  unlike ben affleck's puppy dog approach in reindeer games , phillippe is believable and not too bad at that .  as for the plot , well , that's one of the bad surprises ; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic ( and not even remotely likeable ) criminals ( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people ) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother ( juliette lewis ) after overhearing that she's carrying the baby of painter ( scott wilson ) , a very well connected wealthy man .  the kidnapping devolves into a laborious shoot out where much damage is done and many are killed .  but the anti-heroes escape with the woman while an aging hit man ( james caan ) and two scheming bodyguards ( taye diggs and nicky katt ) remain in pursuit .  directed by christopher mcquarrie , the screenwriter who won an oscar for his work on usual suspects , an overrated piece of crime noir in many circles ( this one included ) , way of the gun is a hodgepodge of crime thriller motifs that just oozes eye rolling familiarity .  unlike phillipe , mcquarrie doesn't seem to be growing at all ; he fills his flick with a sprawling labyrinth of plot all snatched from movies i know i've seen before and worse , it feels like it .  the film lacks even a fresh approach ( like what soderbergh did out of sight or the limey ) to its clich ? s , all of which are spewed before us in a picture that tries so desperately to be hip and gritty without bothering to notice how common it is .  it features characters living by a code they seemed to have picked up in sam peckinpah 101 rather than any thing resembling life .  even attempts at emotional weight feel strained like in preposterous scene where enemies james caan and benicio del torro stop in their tracks to have a cup of coffee and pontificate on life , philosophy , etc . i didn't like the bit much when it first appeared in heat , here , it's even more self consciously "" dramatic "" .  usual suspects , which also featured a bunch of low lives that seemed to live by a code they learned from the movies , worked to some degree because of that astonishing twist ending .  nowadays an astonishing twist per ending is de rigeur , never mind if it deems all that transpired before it completely inconsequential .  thus , nearly every character in way comes with at least one dirty little secret ( most amateurishly projected before they appear ) and it too has an ironic little twist at the end ( nothing earth shattering , like in the usual suspects ) but i admit , i didn't see it coming , and i smiled .  however most of the movie feels exactly like the interrogation scenes between palminteri and spacey in usual suspects : a lot of faux huffing and puffing with no rhythm or reason .  or substance .  it's just as overplotted as suspects , and often dull as any overplotted movie without interesting characters , a distinctive style , or a good script would be .  even the good stuff , most of which involves james caan ( doing a fine job ) , feels odd and out of place in a movie that thinks lines like "" karma is only justice with out the satisfaction "" are clever .  at one point caan laments "" need is the ultimate monkey "" a line so inexplicable he might as well have said "" love is like hippo ass "" .  i've seen porno with better dialogue .  and some with better plot lines too .  but rarely has porn offered up such a talented cast ( i mean , can you even compare james caan to ron jeremy ) .  caan slips into this role with seeming ease , he could do this kind of soft-spoken tough guy in a coma , but he manages to give his character depth and weariness .  benicio del torro is always welcome , though here he plays it fairly straight ( rather than another oddball character creation like the ones the actor gave us in usual suspects and excess baggage ) , adopting a brad pitt-esque quizzical pout to go along with his heavy swaggering .  speaking of pitt , his ex , juliette lewis , is a weak link , either shouting her lines with ear shattering shrillness , or waddling about like a silly goose .  nicky katt was brilliant in a brief role in the limey , here his role is just as brief only he seems wasted ; he's only kept around for his cold presence .  taye diggs has a similar function , cool as ever , but never a character , though the guy has one helluva death scene .  for the most part way is incessantly talky with no reason to give a hippo's ass about any thing that transpires since its characters are never more than simplistic pawns .  it's vaguely tarantino-ish , but in a bad truth and consequences nm way , with phillippe , in one scene , leaping into a stupid rant about "" faggots "" migrating to los angeles .  you know the routine .  the final shoot out is pure bargain basement john woo ( who himself seems to be doing bargain basement john woo ) with interchangeable bad guys lining up to be shot at .  but those gun shots sure crack like thunder .  just the other day i was watching an old dirty harry movie on cable and was stunned to hear the weak elephant grunt-like sound that emanated from harry's fetishized smith and wesson .  oh how far we've come .

0|"when critics attack seemingly well-intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do , their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e-mails , sometimes even mock death threats from those who ( i suppose ) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment .  even politicians ( ! )  tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good-hearted films while praising "" filth "" like pulp fiction .  these [fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic's job is to review the movie , not the message , however sweet and endearing that message may be .  thusly patch adams isn't a bad film because it's about a doctor who cares for his patients ; it's a bad film because it's a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation .  similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place ( though i even doubt that , stay tuned , an explanation is forthcoming ) , it's still an unpleasantly maudlin mess .  the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher ( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey ) , with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude , who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world .  12 year old trevor ( haley joel osmet ) , a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother ( helen hunt ) , comes up with the notion to pay it forward ; this entails a person doing one good deed ( call it an uber favor ) for three others , then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we're all living in a frank capra movie .  meanwhile in a parallel story , a weasely reporter ( jay mohr ) tracks the "" movement "" which has apparently begun to grow .  pay it forward has odd ideas about tone ; at certain points it hurls a smattering of unnecessary cynicism at us as if that would be the appropriate antidote to the unrelenting sappiness at its core .  it's as if director mimi leder didn't have the confidence to make pay it forward the way she intended , and compromised out of fear that her film wasn't "" gutsy "" enough to earn the acclaim it has clearly been made for .  so the picture adds grit ( a child molester propositions trevor , a homeless man returns to heroin after being "" saved "" , a character is knifed while doing a good deed , etc ) though it seems shallow , incorporated into the proceedings because the film itself isn't quite sure if it's ready to buy into its own utopian blather .  pay it forward offers "" crowd pleasing "" elements for general audiences ; jay mohr's umpteenth variation on the waspy sleazeball , angie dickinson's earthy alcoholic bag woman , and the jive-talking "" black hoodlum with a heart of gold "" ( coming on the heals of the black , god-like inmate embodied by gabriel casseus in bedazzled , this may just be the beginnings of a brand new guilty white liberal clich ? .  hurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a "" nigga "" and says things like "" can you feel me ? ""  leave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment .   ( maybe spike's flick wasn't so misguided after all ) .  these scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you'll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings .  while the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience .  it's a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns .  one scene in which a slightly de-glamed helen hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] , hunt's hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip .  spacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance .  maybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he's emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference .  the usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender .  in one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i'm not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol .  the scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow-ups ; it's all very theatrical , especially hunt's performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar .  pay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn't get academy awards .  the picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists .  even haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections .  his acting has become broader , less intimate ; it's as if we can make out the little munchkin's thoughts : "" boy this outta floor em "" .  naturally osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies children , a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher .  never mind that the two couldn't be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller-ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary .  nevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap-ish cornball antics .  but oh how we love bright , articulate , self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life .  they're so adorable .  of course the blame can't all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row .  the first being the peacemaker , a witless post-cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth's possible demise by a crazed meteorite .  the first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ? s , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) .  deep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it's a movie that treats earth's impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days .  the film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching .  in pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : "" see my movie isn't as na ? ve as you might think "" she seems to be saying .  no , it's just horribly confused .

0|"adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy , the wedding singer .  unfortunately , that also has the effect of softening his edge .  he's nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore , not that it was much of one .  he's certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot .  the year is 1985 , letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia .  adam sandler is nice guy robbie , the titular wedding singer , who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits .  robbie's life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee , linda ( angela featherstone ) , leaves him at the altar .  however , things are looking up when he meets julia ( drew barrymore ) , a waitress at the hall .  she's the perfect woman , but for one small flaw : she's engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king , glenn ( matthew glave ) .  so , most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love , and his attempts to stop the wedding .  as far as plots go , it's a pretty thin and tired one .  to fill the gaps , the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia .  from boy george to michael jackson , from miami vice to dallas , from the first cds to the last rubik's cubes , this film revels in all the minutiae .  and then there's the music . . .  learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank , and romy and michele's high school reunion , this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow .  as a result , most songs get maybe a lyric or a half , but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives' eyes : the wedding singer vols .  2 , 3 , and 4 !  while the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring , at least they distract you from the plot .  at least last year's my best friend's wedding stirred up the standard "" keep your true love from marrying someone else "" plot by making the rival a nice person .  here , glenn is such a lowly rat of a man that you never see what julia saw in him .  barrymore , on the other hand , is simply charming as julia .  which leaves us with adam sandler .  he's at his best in the film when his nice guy persona fades a little ( such as when he has a breakdown on stage during a wedding reception ) .  when he's in full nice-guy mode , he's more pathetic than endearing .  the film boasts several cameos ( most notably by steve buscemi and jon lovitz ) .  but none of them work well at all .  buscemi's role as a drunken best man simply fails to be humorous .  lovitz , on the other hand , as a rival wedding singer , makes you long for his good old days on saturday night live , where he was actually funny .  the only cameo which has some appeal is a guest appearance by a classic 80s rocker during the film's finale ( surprisingly , one of the only plot-related scenes which actually works . )  adam sandler still has some work to do before he can become a dependable leading man .  while he attempts to change his image in the wedding singer , the end result is no net gain .

0|arriving in a barrage of hype , the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year .  however , like the golden child , although blair witch has made a lot of money , it's not very good .  donahue , williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth .  the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded , which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles .  although events start of normal , they get weird pretty quickly , while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on .  although an interesting premise , the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity .  the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise .  most of the dialogue is ad-libbed , and still manages to sound like a poor b-movie .  the 'script' eventually degenerates into shouting matches , with the f-word included a lot to sound like students .  there are breaks in these arguments where some creepy events occur , but then it's back to the shouting and swearing , which gets very tiresome very quickly .  if i wanted to see three people get lost in the woods , shout a lot and swear , i'd go on scout camp .  but no , the audience is meant to get some entertainment factor out of this , but i'm not quite sure how .  the supernatural parts of the film are actually interesting , especially if close attention is paid to the story developing first twenty minutes .  with no music and no budget to work with , the film has to depend on natural , psychological scares , which are sometimes well delivered , sometimes not .  i never really felt truly scared during any part of the film , although there is a small sense of fear underlying throughout the film .  however , because the actors are so irritating , the scares are lost when it eventually reverts back to heather saying 'what the f * ck is that ? '  a lot , and mike giggling like a loony .  there's also the niggling fact that these student filmmakers do some really stupid things .  the main problem is the fact that even though these hapless bunch could be killed at any moment , and are hopelessly lost , heather still insists on filming it all .  the film gives a half hearted reason why she should want to do this , but it isn't very convincing .  also , the students have no idea how to survive in the woods , such as following a large river flowing through the woods to civilisation .  there are also some parts where the 'amateur' camcorder footage is obviously staged , heather's apology being a major one .  the blair witch project , in the end , just fails to deliver .  i suppose if you've been lost camping before , the film may deliver some chills , but this is no use for the other 99% of the paying audience who haven't been lost in the woods .  apart from the final minutes , the film is mind boggingly unscary , and the shouting matches get hideously dull .  the spook scenes are short and far between , and any other horror movie could probably achieve the same amount of fear that these scenes provide .  although a good idea , it's not executed well enough to be a fun , scary cinema experience .  it's a worrying fact when the website ( http : //www . blairwitch . com   ) is better than the film .  |-0.8000000000000002|0.9|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment of the explanations is negative as the reviewers criticize the film for its mediocre acting, ad-libbed dialogue, lack of scares, uninteresting/dull execution, and failure to deliver a satisfying horror experience.

0|"the u . s . army utilizes a number of books known as field manuals which stipulate the specific way in which almost every action imaginable must be done .  one particular field manual is known as the fm 22-5 , which among other things , covers the practice of saluting .  under the "" saluting "" section is a sub-section which covers how a salute is rendered by a military work detail in the presence of a superior officer .  the salute is rendered by the highest-ranking individual present when the superior officer comes within six paces of the detail , and is dropped when the officer passes six paces from the detail .  in any event , the salute is rendered only by the man ( or woman ) in charge , rather than by the whole group .  almost at the very beginning of the general's daughter , we see a general's motorcade passing a work detail .  everyone salutes .  it looked impressive , but it just wasn't right .  that little bit showed me that someone either didn't do the appropriate research , or made the conscious decision to go with style over substance for the scene .  in fact , this would serve as a metaphor for the rest of the picture , as it seems director simon west tried so hard to craft a film with atmosphere and flash that he forgot a coherent story and good characterization are also crucial to a good movie .  what results is a film that looks good , but like that one scene , just isn't right .  the first fifteen minutes of the film is a good example .  paul brenner ( john travolta ) is an agent for the army's criminal investigation division , undercover at a georgia army base to investigate an illegal arms sale .  prior to the transaction , the buyer gets a whiff that brenner isn't the unscrupulous supply sergeant he's supposed to be , and later that night attempts to kill him by shooting up the houseboat on which brenner is living .  so ensues a cat and mouse action sequence which ends like a certain scene in raiders of the lost ark ( we'll just say that it involves propellers ) .  brenner then receives new orders when the commanding general's daughter , captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , is found naked , bound , and dead on one of the base's training ranges .  he is teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) to uncover the truth about the peculiarly gruesome murder .  what i want to know is why the whole action scene with the arms buyer was even necessary .  it gives no insight into brenner , other than the fact that he's a little cocky .  does the arms subplot turn up later ?  no , so why add this extra running time to the film ?  the answer : it looked cool .  or how about the "" atmosphere "" ?  the beginning of the general's daughter presents us with imagery of the deep south - thick trees , dirt roads , sultry colors over water - all backed up with bayouesque music .  nice immersion in the setting , but it soon doesn't matter , for when the film's plot shifts over to the murder investigation , so does the entire mood .  no attention is paid to the location of the story , and the music is altered to fit a very generic thriller theme .  did the filmmakers start out thinking they were making a different movie ?  instead of creating a cohesive atmospheric theme for the entire film , we get the distraction of one of theme followed by another , just because the director thought he should show off some of the countryside .  the above examples also serve to illustrate that inconsistency is another problem with this movie .  as i've already mentioned , an entire section of the film doesn't jibe with the rest , and the characterization only adds to the difficulty .  brenner , who comes across as a man with little respect for authority , suddenly snaps to in the presence of general campbell ( james cromwell ) and utters some of the corniest "" yes , sir "" s i've ever heard .  he even delivers an emotion-charged monologue about why he will work so hard to catch the person who killed the general's daughter , even though he was totally flippant about the whole thing just a couple of minutes previous .  sunhill , who initially comes across as a professional investigator , utilizes a couple of blatantly illegal methods to obtain information , and even revels in her ingenuity .  both characters are protagonists , but it's hard to get behind them when their personalities are all over the place , and in some cases , simply unappealing .  i could imagine that during filming , west would shoot a scene , then take the actors aside and tell them , "" let's do it again , but this time , i want more . ""  i say this because although travolta and stowe are normally very good , in this film they overact in most of their scenes .  an even worse offender is clarence williams iii as the general's aide , colonel fowler .  i swear the guy says all of his lines from the position of attention .  a far cry from his days as linc in "" the mod squad "" , i can't help but think he was acting from west's direction .  a couple of side characters including a west point psychologist ( john beasly ) and a young female private ( ariyan a . johnson ) make their scenes nearly impossible to bear .  the only two actors who seem to have escaped west's influence are james woods , who provides a good performance as colonel moore , elisabeth's mentor at the psychological operations unit , and timothy hutton as colonel kent of the military police .  woods relishes the role of a man whose job is playing with people's minds , and does so without ever taking it over the top .  hutton just kind of hangs around , but at least he wasn't overacting .  i haven't read the nelson demille novel on which this movie was based , but i'll bet more than a few dollars that the story was better in book form .  the movie version has got characters which come and go with little or nothing to do except fill up space , or provide bits of information which seem to neither mean anything in terms of advancing the story nor reveal any significance once the whole story is finished .  every time we're presented with some new aspect to the case , west gives us more of that flash by playing it up like it's the most momentous discovery ever , but the information is not used by the investigators at all .  instead , when conclusions are drawn , they are such tremendous leaps of faith that you wonder if successful investigations are not based on facts , but lucky guesses instead .  the army should have saved time by bringing in brennan and sunhill , letting them play a game of twenty questions with the suspects , then letting them guess who the killer was .  would've been over in a half hour .  the film finishes with a sort of bookend , featuring the same style and southern scenery as the very beginning .  literally during the closing credits , we get to see brennan get in his car and drive off , then we get to see sunhill get in her car and drive off .  they both seem kind of happy .  maybe they were driving away from simon west .

0|i don't appreciate it when a thriller manipulates the viewer into thinking the plot is interesting , when in fact it's ludicrous .  in the case of the general's daughter , the plot is more than capable of intriguing you to a certain point .  but at this juncture in the story , the movie begins to fall apart like a crumbling cookie .  this predictable summer thriller is only sporadically involving , and that is unfortunately not enough to compensate for all of it's detailed flaws .  get past one moment early on where john travolta exercises his southern accent , and you're likely to survive this entire movie .  travolta plays criminal investigations divisions officer paul brenner , who's working undercover at a military base when another situation arises : the apparent rape and murder of a young female officer ( leslie stefanson ) .  it turns out that the victim is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) .  let the investigation begin .  with the assistance of fellow cid investigator sarah sunhill ( played rather on-the-sidelines by madeleine stowe ) , brenner uncovers what appears to be an intricate and bizarre homicide case .  things begin to get marginally engrossing when we meet colonel moore ( james woods ) , a former commanding officer of the deceased who has a few secrets up his sleeve .  woods submits another scene-stealing performance here as he oozes authority , surrounded by clouds of smoke emitted from his cigar .  with echoes of his supporting role in true crime , in which he duked it out with clint eastwood in enjoyably profane verbal exchanges , he makes every moment believable .  here though , the intense dialogue comes care of confrontations with travolta , as the two send mindful , knowing glares across the room .  there are many scenes such as this in the general's daughter , in which the veteran cast performs splendidly under pressure , but the circumstances that tie these meetings together are difficult to absorb .  director simon west ( con air ) , shows a watchful eye of delivering a stylish looking thriller , but he fails miserably when it comes to the intellectual part of it .  the general's daughter is , more often than not , a predictable and unexciting mess .  it does not help matters that the plot is virtually actionless , dragging it's heels all the way at a mind-numbing snails pace .  a few brief action scenes , marvelously handled in the editing department , show that the movie could have delivered such a more proficient package .  from a director who does such a great job of staging explosions and miraculous stunts , i suggest west should stick with mindless , rip-roaring action features and attempt to avoid future projects like this .  still , the movie is certainly not without it's merits .  the acting is very good from the majority of the experienced cast .  the performances range from commanding ( travolta ) to electric ( woods ) to stiff-as-a-board ( cromwell , who doesn't show off his real talents here ) .  madeleine stowe manages to hold her own for a while , but as the female lead in an action-thriller , she doesn't pull through sufficiently .  one of the problems with the execution is that it's very predictable .  >from minute one , i had few doubts about the identity of the killer in question .  the script even unwillingly points him out for us , using familiar techniques to hide his guilt until the unmasking toward the end .  in all fairness , we've seen many of the devices used in the general's daughter put to greater effect in other films .  the secrets behind the girl's mysterious death are explained gradually , but by the resolution we have tunneled through so much malarkey that it feels unnecessary and surprisingly silly .  the general's daughter is not a terrible movie , and it is involving enough to sustain a viewer's attention span for a certain period of time .  but it just could have been so much better .  |-0.3566666666666667|0.8333333333333334|0.9|The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly negative, with criticism towards the predictable and unexciting plot and execution of the movie.

0|"you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man .  while watching instinct , i couldn't help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies .  even beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn't a very good film .  it's painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly .  i didn't hate it -- it's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good .  but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved .  i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it's pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams .  things start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) .  caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous .  the subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years .  powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it's now caulder's job to find out of he's mentally competent enough to stand trial .  through a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell .  even though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting .  as i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he's on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he's not acting , that he's actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas .  the character himself isn't very interesting -- he's just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action .  gooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual .  the screenplay , written by gerald di pego and "" suggested by "" a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he's obsessed with his work ) .  nonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct .  unfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting .  turtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct's artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots .  first , we have the prison warden subplot .  the prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder's progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that's fine .  there's also the prison guard subplot .  the prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he's instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion .  then there's the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man .  if some of this stuff sounds familiar , that's because they're all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films .  the evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here .  the offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo's nest had .  ashton's evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown's in the shawshank redemption .  hopkins' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs .  and then there's the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film .  perhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth .  the message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are "" takers , "" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas .  i can sympathize with that , but only when it's in a compelling film .  this is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards .  what does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ?  if all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today .  if the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn't rely on the strength of its actors .

0|"this film is worth seeing for those who want to see what mick jagger looks like when sporting an abe lincoln beard .  the rock and roller is asked to carry the film as the action antihero of australian legend . . . ned  kelly , the so-called robin hood of the aussies .  but he fails to be convincing , in my opinion he is better suited to play gene kelly than ned kelly .  the film opens to a b/w prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution .  then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback , coming home from jail after a 3-year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family .  this scene is set in 1871 .  in the background we hear the booming voice of waylon jennings , as he sings shel silverstein's lyrics , which tells -- of ned's hatred for the british rule and hope for ireland to be a republic .  ned says a debt must be paid . . .  as he hears voices from his dead father , his class-divided country , and his conscience , all telling him to get revenge .  so begins ned's romp through australia's outback , seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered .  he begins by stealing horses , after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray , which favors the rich landowners .  when he's only 20 he forms a gang , causing him to hide the rest of his life from the police , who put a price on his head of two thousand pounds .  when ned's mother ( clarissa kaye ) is jailed on a false charge of abetting criminals and sentenced to 3-5 years , ned offers to surrender in exchange for his mother's freedom .  when the authorities refuse , the kelly brothers go on a robbing rampage , burning mortgages of the poor found in postal vaults and murdering some soldiers .  rampaging through the outback , they gather sympathy among the poor and lower classes , who don't trust the traps ( police ) .  spoiler to follow in the next paragraph .  in the climax , kelly and his gang plan to ambush a train with british police , but someone kelly trusted tips the police on the train and kelly is trapped in a saloon and captured .  ned's brothers commit suicide rather than be taken alive .  but kelly's gang escapes , as ned heroically has the police go after only him and his brothers , as they become decoys .  this was a flat presentation , hardly touching an emotional button on what all the fuss was about over ned kelly's call for justice .  jagger didn't have a prayer in succeeding in this dry script offered by ian jones and tony richardson .  the story failed to focus on australia , seemingly a more british film than australian .  under richardson's lackluster direction , all jagger seemed to do , was proclaim his innocence and vow revenge , which soon became a shrill cry .  if you want to see a better film about ned kelly , catch "" mad dog morgan "" ( 76 ) , a much truer and more daring version , with dennis hopper giving a much better characterization of ned kelly's madness , something this film could only do in a ho-hum manner .

0|"the best thing -- in fact , the only good thing -- i can say about dark city is that it made me want to go see l . a . confidential again .  or go rent body heat , to see william hurt do some real noir .  or even -- god help me -- palmetto .  alex proyas's new movie screams atmosphere .  i screamed , too , "" get me out of this theater ! ""  new line cinema spent millions of dollars creating the expressionistic film noir visuals and paying the actors , and doesn't have any way to get it back .  i paid $4 . 25 for a matinee screening and don't have any way to get my money back , either .  you'll hear a lot from other critics about the look and feel of this movie .  i will admit that the cinematographers and costume designers and set artists and cgi graphics geeks all worked hard to create a stunning , nightmarish future world where it's always a late night in 1948 , complete with rotary phones and automats and fedoras .  i've got news for you fellows -- i don't care how hard you worked , or how visually stunning this movie looks -- you wasted your time and mine , working on a movie without a plot , without a clear sense of direction of where it wanted to go , without a soul or a reason to care .  the movie starts out oh-so-promising .  john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) is lying in a bathtub in the sort of seedy hotel that in real life , would have been boarded up long ago .  there is a dead , mutilated prostitute in the other room -- a surprise , as he has lost his memory .  the phone rings : it's a sinister-sounding man , claiming to be his doctor , telling him to flee for his life .  all well and good , right ?  wrong .  apparently , someone decided that the audience was just a bit too dim to figure out the intricacies of the plot .   ( this is getting to be a popular assumption in hollywood . )  so , the actual beginning of the movie is not sewell running for his life , rather , it's a voice-over narration by the aforementioned doctor ( keifer sutherland ) explaining exactly what is going on and who is responsible .  it's as though sam the piano player had told us that rick and ilsa had been getting it on in paris in the first three minutes of casablanca .  no , wait , that's not fair to casablanca .  it's more like watching a new plotline at the first of the show -- or if you want to know how i really feel , having an off-screen narrator explain that gilligan won't be getting off the island in this episode .  >from here , the coherence of the plot goes down faster than ( insert monica lewinsky joke here ) .  the characters just wander around the city aimlessly and bump into each other for no apparent reason , and that's what moves the plot .  what we're left with is a string of unanswered questions that don't make any sense .  we're given aliens with unlimited omnipotent powers , yet they forget to use them at critical moments and get themselves killed .  we're given a hero who can "" tune "" into these same powers , yet he only uses them when it's convenient to the plot .  we're given a whole long list of loose ends that go nowhere  usually , critics will say that an actor playing an underwritten part "" isn't given much to do . ""  in this movie , no one is given anything to do .  sewell is given the impossible role of a man who doesn't remember anything , and plays it like . . .  um . . .  a man who doesn't remember anything .  the aliens are tall , pasty-faced , and bald , and wear long black cloaks and fedoras to remind us that they're evil -- and there's a child alien as well , straight out of an anne rice novel .  sutherland is saddled with a limp , a twitchy eye , and a breathy accent to remind us that he's in league with the aliens .  to its credit , dark city boasts two impressive bits of casting .  william hurt is perfectly cast as the world-weary inspector charged with catching the man who is murdering prostitutes all over the city .  jennifer connelly , playing sewell's love interest , is given two all-too-brief moments on screen as a lounge singer -- and turns in the sexiest performace this side of jessica rabbit .  but instead of the dogged policeman and the femme fatale given central treatment in the script ( the way they would be in any self-respecting noir movie ) they're almost tangiential to the plot , such as it is .  the problem with dark city is this : it's a bad science fiction movie pretending to be film noir .  the essence of film noir isn't , as proyas seems to beleive , breathy dialogue or snap-brim fedoras or tall , bald evil villains who would make peter lorre curl up in a corner .  dark city has not one bit of intrigue , moral ambiguity , suspense , or anything else that keeps us coming back to the noir classics .  dark city is like the intricately carved door that kate winslet floats on in titanic .  it's an exceptionlly well-made and intricately designed piece of flotsam , sailing around and around the middle of the ocean , going nowhere .
