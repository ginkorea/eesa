0|"it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable .  the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed .  it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers , james horner .  what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995 .  what drags braveheart down is its screenplay .  it abounds with high production values : john toll's award-winning cinematography ( which also graced edward zwick's 1994 legends of the fall ) , a gorgeous score by horner , and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names .  but this does not save a misguided script .  the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero , but the viewer's only response to his "" heroism "" is intellectual : william wallace ( producer-director mel gibson ) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny , so we have to root for him .  but wallace's actions paint a different story .  he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance .  though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side , the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait , in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king .  wallace speaks of freedom , but his acts point toward vengeance .  after kicking the english out of scotland , he decides to invade england .  this is evident of a "" spartacus complex "" , and this example applies both historically and cinematically .  the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities ; the film spartacus , like braveheart , has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay .  it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film .  horner's score tries to make emotional connection , but the performances and the script do not help .  gibson portrays wallace in such a way that the audience cannot relate to him or identify with him .  this drags down any emotional connection to the film's plot , and turns three hours into a total waste of time .

0|"susan granger's review of "" the watcher "" ( universal )  just what we need : another lurid , trashy serial killer saga .  this time , keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking-clock cat-and-mouse game with james spader , a burnt-out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd .  to taunt spader , who has relocated to chicago , reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too .  before long , he starts mailing photographs of the lonely , unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims , challenging spader , along with the chicago police department , to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again .  in the midst of this murderous frenzy , there's spader's psychologist , played by marisa tomei , who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in "" the cell . ""  writers david elliot , clay ayers and darcy meyers , along with first-time director joe charbanic ( helmer of music videos for reeves' band dogstar ) , dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase , revealing , early on , exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop "" need each other to give meaning to our lives . ""  plus , as reeves explains , "" we're all stacked right on top of each other , but we don't notice each other any more . ""  after that , it's all sound effects and tricky camera-work , along with a muddled , discordant soundtrack .  james spader's acting technique can be described as 'wooden deadpan' while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone 'dude' persona which sometimes works , sometimes doesn't .  chris ellis , as spader's self-important colleague , is the only cast member who manages to be convincing .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" the watcher "" is an appallingly awful , amateurish 2 . the real torture is watching it .

0|ahh yes .  the teenage romance .  an attractive young cast is pitted into an unlikely scenario that could only happen in the movies , and in the end , the guy always gets the girl .  and with the arrival of the breakout hit `she's all that' last year ( followed by a long catalogue of imitators including `10 things i hate about you' and `drive me crazy' ) , the genre previously on life support is once again a hot commodity .  along now comes `down to you' .  the folks at miramax are obviously trying to capitalize on the rabid `she's all that' craze with their latest project , which has the studdly freddie prinze jr . attached and all .  only `down to you' doesn't have the ? unlikely scenario' mentioned above .  it is an extraordinarily ordinary romance - a dull , unattractive teen comedy that sticks to the boring game plan that we're accustomed to .  this is the kind of romance that only giggly 12-year old girls will find convincing .  in strictly textbook fashion , college sophomore and aspiring chef al ( prinze jr . ) meets freshman artist imogen ( julia stiles ) .  they hit it off like a couple can only in the movies .  from here , it's the standard boy-meets-girl , boy-loses-girl , boy-drinks-entire-bottle-of-shampoo-and-may-or-may-not-get-girl-back story .  the plot is conveniently assembled to suit the requirements of the main characters , who are frequently taking part in activities that . . . .  well , only happen in the movies .  fortunately , the cast of `down to you' has a certain appeal .  freddie prinze jr . and julia stiles are an adorable couple , and when on screen together , they radiate the sort of warmth and charisma that the movie should have centered around .  zak orth , as the newly realized porn star monk , shows an unmistakable flair with handling all of the film's intelligent dialogue .  rounding out the impressive ensemble of young talent are shawn hatosy ( `the faculty' ) , selma blair ( `cruel intentions' ) and ashton kutcher ( tv's `that 70's shows' ) .  even the fonz himself - henry winkler , the epitome of teenage angst and nostalgia - has a welcome role as al's dad , the host of the popular cooking program `chef ray' .  maybe the concept of `down to you' looked good on paper to draw such a crowd .  as a feature film , however , the finished product is bland and tasteless fluff with only an occasional whiff of cuteness to keep the gears from stopping entirely .  perhaps worst of all , `down to you' is not funny .  the jokes are drawn from obvious sources and the resulting humor is banal and uninspired .  the characters on screen , often laughing at each other's goofy/embarrassing antics , seemed far more amused than the audience .  even the giggly 12-year old girls had grown restless toward the end as they waited impatiently for the formula to run it's course .  the one mildly clever segment featured winkler and prinze jr . in a fantasy sequence called `cooks' , a `cops' take-off in which the father and son would storm houses and cook a decent meal for ? needy' families ( with the assistance of a fully-armed swat team , of course ) .  when this is the highlight reel , you know the remaining film could leave something to be desired .  in order to make a teen comedy work , you've got to have characters that show something by way of depth and identity .  `10 things i hate about you' actually featured characters who were more than walking flashcards , and the result was refreshing .  no such luck with `down to you' .  it's just a textbook romance where , despite absurd circumstances , everything is bound to work out in the end .  and at the end of the whole clich ? d ordeal , the nicest thing you could possibly say would be ` . . . .  only in the movies' .  |-0.7333333333333334|0.8166666666666668|0.7666666666666666|"The sentiment of all the explanations is negative as the reviewers describe the movie ""Down to You"" as unimaginative, dull, filled with cliches, banal humor, lacking depth in characters, and having a predictable ending."
0|" "" virus "" is the type of cliched , vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it .  strangely enough , on the same mid-january weekend last year , another film was released like this , "" deep rising , "" about an ugly monster on a cruise liner .  prior movies with the almost exact same storyline include 1989's "" leviathan , "" 1989's "" deep star six , "" and all four "" alien "" pictures .   "" virus , "" in comparison , is a servicable thriller , well-made and produced , but since it doesn't include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence , it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on .  based on a series of comic books , "" virus "" concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat , which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon .  after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking , ( un ) lucky for them , a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen .  once the team reaches the russian ship , they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted .  after turning the power back on , however , there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship , and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself .  one survivor finally does turn up , nadia ( joanna pacula ) , who informs the suicidal and stern captain ( donald sutherland ) and one of the crew , kit foster ( jamie lee curtis ) , that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship , taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out .  if "" virus "" sounds like all of the previously mentioned movies , you're correct .  although the technical artistry is fairly impressive to bring the mechanical creature to life , the film itself doesn't appear to have a brain in its head .  the film sticks so close to the worn-out conventions of the "" creature "" genre that it is amazing anyone would spend the money and time filming it when they could be making an original film .  the actors are all very good and have all proven their acting abilities in the past , but they are sorely wasted here and do not really even have characters to play .  in her second return to horror in the last year , jamie lee curtis once again proves to be a strong and resourceful heroine , but that is about it .  although 1998's "" halloween : h20 "" was also a disappointment , at least she was given a few scenes to develop a character , unlike here .  donald sutherland has fallen on hard times recently by starring in thoroughly disposable films , such as 1994's "" the puppet masters , "" although i just watched him in the superb 1978 sci-fi classic "" invasion of the body snatchers , "" where he was fabulous .  the last of the three top-billers is william baldwin , but it is fairly hard to say if he is good or not in the picture , since he has nothing to do .  basically , "" virus "" is another one of those films where a group of people walk around and investigate a space ship/ocean liner/haunted house until the deadly and equally grotesque and slimy creature pops up and kills them one-by-one .  it is not the worst of its type , but it is far from one of the best , and when exactly are studios going to give up recycling such shameless and overdone plot gimmicks such as this ?  as long as some of them keep making money , i suspect the answer is never .

0|"over 40 years ago , a japanese production company called toho introduced the land of the rising sun to gojira , a reptilian creature of immense proportions created by mankind's nuclear testing .  partly flight of fancy , partly commentary on the exploitation of atomic power and weaponry , gojira emerged from the ocean to terrorize tokyo .  a year later , gojira was marketed to the united states by adding three things : a new name , a dubbed english track , and raymond burr .  as godzilla , the film took on the rest of the world .  thirty years later , toho remade the classic film and once again took it to the american market by adding the same three things ( yes , including raymond burr ) and called it godzilla 1985 .  now it's 14 years after toho's remake , and director roland emmerich has allowed the giant lizard to make an american first run .  in emmerich's godzilla , matthew broderick plays dr . niko tatopoulos , a biologist who is called in to join other scientists in the south pacific already studying the existence of a radiation-induced super mutant which leaves footprints the size of livingrooms .  when the mutant reptile suddenly appears out of the hudson river , tatopoulos and the rest of the team relocate themselves back to the states .  meanwhile , tatopoulos's college girlfriend , audrey timmonds ( maria pitillo ) , works in new york city as an assistant to a big-time news reporter .  she'd like to be a reporter herself , and when godzilla comes ashore , she figures this is her big break .  of course , with the big guy running amok in the city , niko and audrey are bound to cross paths , and are joined by victor "" animal "" palotti ( hank azaria ) , audrey's trusty cameraman friend , and phillipe roche ( jean reno ) , an operative for the french government , whose nuclear testing started the whole problem in the first place .  together they attempt to find and destroy the surprisingly elusive godzilla .  with the resources of the most cutting edge special effects houses and the clout of one of the nation's premiere movie production companies , one would think emmerich could make a film truly deserving of the name godzilla .  he didn't .  right up there with the lost world , godzilla is one of the biggest disappointments in recent cinematic history .  the plot is pretty much what we expect : the big dinosaur-like creature comes out of the water and starts smashing new york city , and it's up to our heroes to figure out why this thing is on its rampage and how it can be stopped , while the military makes futile attempts to bring the creature down .  the script , however , is painfully bad .  it's fraught with lines so corny , they don't even belong in b-movies , and includes many character actions which make you think , "" you idiot , "" or "" you stupid girl . ""  i suppose when you've got a movie with a giant lizard loose in new york , any other semblance of reality goes out the window as well .  why is it that godzilla topples some buildings by merely brushing against them , but is conveniently able to leap atop others ?  why do helicopters have to follow godzilla by flying dangerously between buildings where they can lose sight of him , when they could more easily keep track of him by flying a little higher and in a straight line ?  why do sidewinder missiles , which have small explosive warheads , blow up entire buildings when they miss godzilla ?  why is a mission to bomb madison square garden carried out by three f-18 fighter-bombers , when flights of such aircraft are always comprised of multiples of two ?  okay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll .  broderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he's weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way .  hank azaria does what he can , but don't expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage .  like broderick's , azaria's character is quite simply lacking in color .  what really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting .  casting must have been asleep on this one .  the one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we've seem him do in the past .  although his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable .  unfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities .  the entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it .  this results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess .  most of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously .  although emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ?  if we can't take the characters seriously , the threat they face is an empty one because we simply don't care what happens to them .  godzilla simply pulls too many punches in its attempt to be a film more light-hearted than it should be .  far be it from me to want to see more carnage in the theaters , but here's a behemoth running through the city !  there's bound to be a lot of casualties , but instead godzilla is afflicted with the after-school g . i .  joe cartoon syndrome , where almost everyone seems to get out of harm's way just in time .  in a couple of scenes , godzilla briefly breathes fire .  none of the characters even remark upon this ability , nor is it used to any particular advantage by the filmmakers .  it's as if the special effects people just wanted to show that yes , godzilla can do this , just like in the old movie .  consider another punch pulled .  through creative script writing , you can make a sequel out of just about any movie , but the final scene in this one doesn't just leave the door open , it opens into a hallway leading directly into a room where godzilla ii is waiting patiently .  it made me want to gag .  emmerich should have done away with 90% of the humor and in-jokes and played this one as a straight action film .  with an intelligently written screenplay , godzilla could have been so much more .  however , by confusing the viewer with a ton of add-ins and parodies , the movie ends up being something that just doesn't work .  now if they only had raymond burr . . . .

0|"before the remake of psycho appears , we've got to suffer through this remake of an earlier hitchcock film , dial m for murder .  as usual , hollywood has filled it with glitz and big name stars , and it all amounts to a loud sounding nothing .  the film opens with emily ( paltrow ) and david ( viggo mortensen ) 'having fun' in an loft apartment .  the problem is , paltrow is married to stephen ( douglas ) , who is not too happy when he discovers this affair .  if i was paltrow , though , i'd definitely go with mortensen .  less wrinkles .  anyhow , stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition : he'll pay him to kill his lovely wife .  mortensen agrees , but the murder goes awry , and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses .  unfortunately , the film dosen't progress very fast .  in fact , it moves like a tortoise with arthritis ( read : very , very s-l-o-w . )  the plot moves nowhere fast , and only becomes exciting in very short bursts .  not too good for a 'thriller . '  also , the performances , apart from douglas , are below par .  paltrow , showing immense talent in se7en ( 1995 ) and sliding doors ( 1997 ) is strangely stilted , even unconvincing , in this movie .  mortensen is a little bit better , coming across as a younger douglas , but his role isn't meaty enough to show all his talent .  which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film , which is does .  however , i doubt douglas finds it very hard to play a stogie smoking , drinking womanizer with a creepy underside .  also popping up in the film is david suchet , playing a shifty looking detective .  again , it's not a character we're seeing on the screen , it's david suchet .  the director , who bought us the fugitive , piles on all the flash techniques , such as zoom-in's , quick cuts , etc . the lighting is also interesting .  however , looks can't save this film from the depths of mediocre , and the film seemed to work better in a single set anyway .  the screenplay is o . k , but there's some hackneyed sub-plot about douglas being a ruthless player on wall street ( again ) and the ending is surprisingly stupid and cliched .  the characters also make incredibly dumb moves , especially paltrow , and stephen appears to lose all intelligence in the last reel .  with a combination of no tension , drama , or decent characters , a perfect murder is a failure all round , and an incredible disappointment .  there are a few bright moments , but they are far and few between .  the last thing a thriller should be is boring , and although the film just barely manages to keep your interest thanks to michael douglas , you wouldn't be missing anything if you decided not to watch a perfect murder .  overall rating=  review by david wilcock ? 1998   "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes  "|-0.7333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|"The remakes of ""Psycho,"" ""A Perfect Murder,"" and ""Dial M for Murder"" all receive negative reviews for various reasons such as slow pacing, mediocre performances, predictable plot, and lack of tension or interesting characters.

0|coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers , relentless , 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz , played by character actor leo rossi , spawned three more sequels .  relentless 3 , third in the row , features sam dietz again , but this time detective , who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case , doesn't want to deal with similar line of work .  divorced , demoralised and transferred , he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer , and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz's old cases .  to make things even more interesting , it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation .  fans of the british tv films and mini-series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies .  they both feature vicious psychopathic killers , yet also give a lot of , usually depressive , details about chief investigator's private lives .  this one isn't an exception , but similarities with british television are only in content .  the execution and style is different , which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best .  useless , gratuitous erotica also doesn't help either , obviously making this film longer than it should be .  the actors are good , though - leo rossi is fine as usual , and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career .  signy coleman as dietz's love interest , is , on the other hand , quite miscast .  but she won't have to worry about it in the future career , since relentless 3 wasn't supposed to be anybody's finest moment anyway .  |-0.26666666666666666|0.8000000000000002|0.8000000000000002|The overall sentiment of the review is negative, with criticism towards the mediocre execution, unnecessary erotica, and miscasting.

0|"i don't expect much from eddie murphy these days .  for the past four years , the gods of cinema--or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates--have allowed him to make one bad movie after another .  such films as metro , doctor dolittle , holy man , life , and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed-up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures .  the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film , nutty professor ii : the klumps .  the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump , an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places .  sherman has just invented a new "" youth drink "" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time .  janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor ( and for the most ridiculous reasons ) .  with love on his mind , sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego , buddy love from the first professor , who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers .  with some convoluted mumbo-jumbo about dna extraction , sherman extracts the "" buddy love "" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy-dandy lab beaker .  but one night , the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated . . .  because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy .  then the klump family , all played by eddie murphy , step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex , flabby breasts , a slew of fart and dick jokes , and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes .  and did i mention the part where larry miller gets anally raped by an overgrown hamster ?  the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can be in this world -- with enough soft lighting and people on the verge of tears in every scene .  pure and simple , the klumps is a failure .  its script was handled by not one but five screenwriters , and it really shows during the awkward transitions between scenes .  any sense of story and plot were lost in the rewrite process .  it's more discerning to learn that chris weitz and paul weitz , the team behind one of the funniest films of the last decade , american pie , have their names stamped to this trash .  hey guys - quick note - keep this movie off of your resumes .  the characterization of sherman's family , the klumps , is one of the most ignorant stereotypes of a black family i have ever seen in cinema .  everyone member of the family is a large person who wipes the bins clean at a local buffet restaurant like pigs at a trough .  the grandma is an oversexed fiend who constantly talks of ways to pleasure her man and her sagging breasts .  the father is gruff , is fired from a blue-collar job , is sexually inadequate , and cannot communicate with his family about his feelings .  the mother is ignorant of all the negativity around her and seems to hold no opinion about anything or anyone .  the brother is silent and brooding and resembles the ice cube gangster character from boyz in the hood .  sherman himself is terribly insecure and never conveys anything for the audience to become attached to .  but the main problem with the film is its inability to create any type of convincing conversational or situational comedy .  the family scenes from the first nutty professor worked so well because their conversations were short and direct .  and you got the feeling that these crass people couldn't act like this all the time .  the sequel does the reverse and drives the negatives of the klumps right in to the hilt , making the first five minutes of their interaction enjoyable and the last 55 or so unbearable and pathetic .  after a while , their conversations just become a barrage of frustrated anger tinged with indecency and overworked premises that end up drawing energy away from any type of empathy one might feel for the central themes of the story .  its also a damn shame that the makeup magic of rick baker -- who worked on the original nutty professor and won an academy award for his work on an american werewolf in london -- and amazing digital special effects that enabled murphy to interact with himself in such beautiful motions are built around such a lame story line .  even the best effects can't seem to save the most pathetic of movies these days .  now that i think about it , the worst thing about this film has to be all the money that it will make .  people will be lined up around the block for it .  the studios will concoct the a sequel for release in the summer of 2002 .  eddie murphy will be signed up to take not just one role or five roles , but he'll play every character in the movie .  i just can't wait to see eddie murphy in a love scene with himself .

0|lucas was wise to start his star wars trilogy with episode 4 : episode 1 is a boring , empty spectacle that features some nice special effects .  after the familiar 'a long time ago . . . . '  opening , the film starts with the opening yellow crawl that features in every star wars movie and computer game .  the plot is that the trade confederation are blocking off supplies to the peaceful planet of naboo , ruled by queen amidala ( portman ) jedi knights qui-gon ( neeson ) and obi wan ( mcgregor ) are sent to negotiate a deal with the confederation to stop the blockade .  however , this simple blockade is not all it seems , and the jedi knights soon have to deal with many more dangers , including facing the evil darth maul ( ray park . )  they also meet the future darth vadar , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd )  star wars is largely a failure in all the major areas of filmmaking : script , direction and characters .  the script desperately tries to make an thin and boring story into a two hour epic .  the trade confederation plot is just not as exciting as the death star , and as the film goes on the drama becomes more and more non-existent .  there's no underlying tension , and no urgent need to see what the outcome is .  the film also takes a leisurely pace in telling the boring story , which doesn't help .  there's no snap to make the film work , it moves at a plod .  the script is boring : all the characters speak in morals , especially anakins mother .  there's no group spirit evident here , and when all characters can speak only in profound statements or bark orders , it's evident that not much is going to happen .  the two leads are hideously boring , static characters given little to do and too much time to do it .  qui-gon and obi-wan hold no presence on film , and give little for the audience to root for .  the audience will probably warm more to bad guy darth maul , if he had been given more screen time .  maul is one of the most underused bad guys in film history , even if he does provide the only 'straight' plot line in the film ( all the other plots in this film are to be concluded throughout the trilogy . )  anakin is annoying and unlikeable . ,  instead of cute and huggable as lucas no doubt intended .  it's probably not surprising that his hateful little boy , unfortunately blessed 'ani' by everyone he knows , joins the dark side and kills everyone as quickly as possible .  the comedy relief is supposedly provided by the gangly jar jar brinks , although in the end none is provided in the film by him .  although his floppy features will no doubt be great for stuffed toys , the lines and actions he is given are painfully unfunny .  the only good laugh is when his tongue is burned by a 'pod' racer , because i knew he wouldn't be able to talk for a while .  queen amidala is a nothing in the film , she serves no real purpose apart from the fact that she must 'serve her people , ' and go goo-goo over anakin .  again , her role will become more important in the later episodes , and is given little to do here .  the actors don't help the movie much either .  liam neeson seems bored and embarrassed , and seems desperate to leave the movie as quickly as possible .  mcgregor comes across as a posh mothers boy , with little charm .  the casting director must have chose him because he's scottish like alec guinness : there's little other explanation for it .  natalie portman is plagued by hideous costumes and a poor script , but she delivers a spunky performance .  and jake lloyd looks at everyone with hateful eyes and delivers his lines in a bored voice .  there's very little talent evident with him , it's hard to see why lucas chose him when there are better child actors out there .  he's not even very 'cute . '  the main claim of the film , the special effects , are okay .  there's nothing impressive about them , yet they complement the story well .  the cgi takes away much of the human element , however .  the battle droids for example , the replacement for the stormtroopers , are characterless little computer graphics , lacking the humour and humanness that came from the stormtroopers .  episode 1 is just disappointing .  it's got high production values , but little else .  the music is meandering , except near the end .  the plot gives us no-one to root for , or even care for .  the effects are nice , but dull .  the plot goes on for half an hour longer than it should .  there's an air of manufacturing among the whole sorry affair , and many clich ? s are catered for throughout the film .  apart from a remotely exciting pod race sequence , episode 1 is a dry affair that serves little purpose , except to make money and to get us to watch episode 2 to see what happens to the many unfinished plot lines in the film .  disappointing is barely the word .  rating=  |-0.8300000000000001|0.8833333333333334|0.9|The overall sentiment of the explanations is that the film is negatively perceived.

0|"tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie .  the film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it's evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster .  enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious .  the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium .  tectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences .  it's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , "" look !  art ! "" ) ,  although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters .  because we're constantly made aware that we're watching a play or a movie , it's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer's ideas .  they're not real , sympathetic , or believable .  i'm willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success .  tectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) .  one day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself .  while preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision .  meanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host .  with settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else .  however , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers .  the tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn't take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious .  tectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point .  there are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren't bilingual ) .  the only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it's different , ( b ) it's not like anything they've seen before , and ( c ) it's pretentious .  for everyone else , it's not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage .

 add onto that set design that makes the cabinet of doctor caligari absolutely cheerful in comparison , and you have something to give the wee ones ( and some of the mentally unstable larger folk ) to keep them up at night .  some gore .  don't bring children to this one .  don't bring adults to this one , unless they're fascinated by puppetry and/or hate capitalism so badly they enjoy seeing wooden puppets raped .  blech .   . no fun whatsoever .  meier ( west germany , 1986 ) director/screenwriter : peter timm cast : rainier grenkowitz , nadja engelbrecht , alexander hauff , thomas besvater sub-titled  this film takes us back and forth over the east german/west german border with meier , an east german wallpaperer whose father in the west dies and leaves him a good deal of money .  his uncle ( also in the west ) sneaks meier out of the country , unknown to the east germans .  meier , however , is less than thrilled-- his girlfriend , his friends and his job ( which he likes ) all exist in east germany .  after a round-the-world trip ( his boss think's he's on leave in bulgaria ) , meier starts visiting east germany on day visas with a fake id , and uses his money and his connections to the west to buy his girlfriend presents and bring credit to his work crew's work--while everyone think's he's still living in east germany .  of course , something goes wrong--and the ending is very funny , but it takes the film too long to get there .  the humor is spread too thin , and much of the plot is too obvious ( as is the acting ) .  still , a good concept for the comedy , and the last five minutes are pretty funny .  c -- $2 . 50 .  the right hand man ( australia , 1986 ) director : di drew screenplay : helen hodgman cast : rupert everett , hugo weaving , arthur dignam , jennifer claire , catherine mcclements  after a lifetime of movie-going , and about four years of attending the seattle international film festival , i've learned several rules which , while not absolute , should certainly be given deference to :  1 ) be wary of french comedies .  these people like jerry lewis .  2 ) ken russell is never going to grow up , no matter how long you wait .  3 ) any film where siff associate director gary tucker refers to the lead as "" old pouty-lips "" is probably not worth watching .  4 ) when an australian film only awards credit is best cinematography , watch out !  australia has good cinematographers up the whazoo , but since weir and miller left for foreign shores , finding a good script or director seems to be a difficult ( not impossible--witness malcolm last year ) task .  well , i ignored rules 3 & 4 last night , and sat through a film that should be in the golden turkey awards .  it's as if the director was trying to do one of those classic romance stories that were done in the 30's about tragedy among the gentry , and falling in love with people below your station , and horses .  lots and lots of horses .  the film opens with a stallion mounting a mare under the direction of her ladyship , which i guess is some kind of foreshadowing , because the missus of the house wants to have her son produce an heir .  unfortunately , said son , a reckless idiot who faints at the very worst times , kills his father and loses an arm during a racing accident .  highlights include the amputation sequence ; the doctor's daughter , who has the hots for the son , tasting his urine for a diagnosis ; their tender kissing with a window between them ( while it's raining--you'd think a woman studying medicine would know better ) .  the photography is good , but i kept wishing for b&w--everything seems sepia-colored anyway .  actually , i wished i was watching swimming to cambodia instead , but that's life .  grade : z . avoid like the plague , unless you're looking for inadvertent yuks .

"" priests need nuns , '' yaps c-note , a san francisco pimp .   "" doctors need nurses .  so ho's need pimps . ''  as he tries to persuasively make the same case all the other pimps in the film make ; that the girls need them to show them the ropes , how to make money , to be their security blankets , protectors , and counselors .  the race issue was brought up right from the film's onset , as a number of white interviewees , regular citizens , note that their impression of a pimp , is that he's the lowest form of human .  while , we are told , in the black community , the pimp is looked upon as a successful entrepenaur , riding around in fancy cars , flashing wads of money , dressed in a flamboyant style , where his snake-gaiter shoes might cost him a grand , and where he boasts hollywood style status in the community .  we also see that the black pimps have a number of white girls in their stable and we see how they treat them like dirt , as the film implies that this could be payback for the days of slavery , of master and slave relations .  the film was all about pimp style and their projected image , as they run a hard-sell riff about the virtues of their work .  there are different styles of pimping , but the film mentions them only as being "" macks "" and "" players "" or "" real pimps "" and "" perpetrator pimps , "" but no further clarity is attempted .  it is also failed to get the women's side to this story of abuse , primarily taking the pimp at his word .  the film could never get to the core of what makes the pimp think in such a perverted way as he does , as the filmmakers were taking for a ride by the pimps , who were looking only to pose in front of the camera and say their thing , hungry for their 15-minutes of fame .  the only laughs i got out of this bleak look at an american subculture , was hearing how a few pimps retired and what they are now up to .  danny brown became a blues singer so he could keep his pimp's wardrobe .  while a hollywood pimp called rosebudd , married his ho and turned square , working to support his wife and daughter as a telemarketer .

0|"another formula 'feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles , much like "" waking ned devine , "" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line .  it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town , such as tolerant vicars and policemen , plenty of eccentrics , and of locals who stick together through thick and thin .  the strength of this film lies in its rational theme , that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol .  the film is tolerable until after its first hour , it then falls completely apart , becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but sitcom fluff gone completely bananas .  but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to , at least , be viewed as containing a pertinent message .  its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the 'war on drugs' is about to be escalated into colombia .  the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future , it has so far just ended up causing america's jails to be overcrowded with non-violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america's drug usage and drug supply .  billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war , by backing a corrupt government ( remember vietnam ! ) with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country .  everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam , with this scenario closer to home , so what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war .  the film's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public , something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago , is a theme long overdue for public acceptance , but one that is better received late than never .  there has to be some common sense in distinguishing what drugs should be legalized and how to educate the public on this , rather than making it a police matter altogether .  the film opens in a quaint cornish seaside village at the funeral of the husband of a middle-aged woman , grace ( brenda blethyn ) , who fell out of an airplane , evidently committing suicide .  the widow soon finds out her husband was a bigger bastard than she imagined .  he left her with a stack of enormous bills and put up , without her knowledge , their comfortable 300 year old house as collateral for a failed business venture by taking out a second mortgage .  the widow finds herself bankrupt and with no marketable skills to pay back her husband's enormous debts and prevent her from losing the house and becoming homeless .  she also knows that he was having an affair with a sophisticated woman from london , honey ( quick ) .  what makes the affair doubly unsatisfying , is that when conferring with honey , she finds out that he was a tiger with her in bed but refrained from having sex with her .  even though the locals try to help the bankrupt widow out as best they can , the creditors swoop down on her like vultures .  her gardener and handyman , matthew ( ferguson ) , decides to stay on with her , despite his last check bouncing .  since she is an expert amateur horticulturist , he convinces her to help him revive his hemp plants , which he grows for private use .  the two soon see this as a possibly big business opportunity , as grace works miracles with the plants which turn out to be high-quality stuff .  for grace , this is a way to save her house and get her out of debt ; for the scotsman , matthew , it offers a chance for him to continue to live in this beautiful village and earn enough money to marry his fisherman girlfriend nicky ( valerie ) .  the locals all let the illegal activities go on undisturbed : the police sergeant ( campbell ) pretends not to notice what the bright lights in grace's greenhouse is for , the friendly vicar ( phillips ) counsels about the wisdom of not taking action over something that you can't control , and the doctor ( clunes ) enjoys smoking the weed for recreation .  the story becomes incredulous when grace decides to go to london and score with a big-time drug dealer instead of having matthew go , because she finds out nicky is pregnant and doesn't want matthew to end up in jail .  it is interesting to note , that no one thinks smoking grass is bad for you , only that one can go to jail .  the scene with grace on portobello road in the notting hill section of london , trying to find a drug dealer , while dressed out of place , in a white dress and hat one would wear to a tea party in cornwall but not on the streets of notting hill while looking to make a drug deal , was completely hokey and the film descended into a huge black hole , whereby it never recovered its dignity .  the film moves into the formula mode , whereas grace beats the odds against her failing to survive , as she meets an international drug dealer , a frenchman ( tcheky karyo ) , who is first seen threatening to cut off her fingers but later becomes her business partner and husband as she becomes a millionaire and writes a best selling fiction book about her experiences , thereby becoming a celebrity .  things work out in a ridiculous way , where there is a total breakdown in the character development of grace , where this matronly figure suddenly becomes merely a cartoon figure instead of live flesh and blood .  there are a lot of silly giggles that come forth and the film has just enough of an acting performance by brenda blethyn to breathe air into it before it comes to its belated finale , as it drones on with its transparently gratuitous upbeat tone , until it makes the audience feel good that the sweet old lady succeeded .  this 'unhip' film leaves one with the impression that smoking and growing pot is silly , but should be tolerated as something naughty middle-aged widows screwed by their terrible former husbands must do in order not to remain destitute .  ummm !
