0|"one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself .  such was the case with boxing helena , 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch , daughter of the great david lynch .  made in the dying years of post-twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs , it was hyped as another , "" warped , twisted masterpiece "" of lynch clan .  kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract .  but , the result was extremely disappointing film , which quickly sank into well-deserved oblivion .  the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh ( played by julian sands ) , talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena ( sherilyn fenn ) , beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair .  cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re-establish the relationship .  during one of such occasions , helena is hit by a car , and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her .  after she wakes up , helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh's stylish residence , but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping .  she is still trying to escape , so cavanaugh takes off her arms .  apart from casting sherilyn fenn ( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart ) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies , this film by ms . lynch hasn't got anything in common with the works of director's more talented father .  despite rather bizarre subject , the style of this film is conventional and setting is light , characters are beautiful - but the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray .  jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic - its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos .  the actors aren't good either .  julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man - this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains ; being neurotic doesn't suit him .  bill paxton was better for this role , but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena's boyfriend .  sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks , but even the her greater effort in acting couldn't help this film .  the screenplay , on the other hand , is awful , at least for someone who had made best-seller with laura palmer's diary - the events in this movie are implausible , characters come and go without purpose and many unnecessary subplots only slow down the film and add to the total confusion .  one of those subplots involves character of cavanaugh's "" regular "" girlfriend , played by betsy clarke .  the twist at the end , although unpredictable , is unbelievable and the viewers , who had the stomach to endure entire film , would feel cheated .  all in all , boxing helena is disorganised quasi-artistic mess of a movie that should be remembered as nothing more than one of the wiser decisions in kim basinger's career .

0|"let's get this one over with as quickly as possible .  if there was a possibility to receive a refund , this review would not be forthcoming .  but as it is , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the loudest , longest , and ultimately most amateurishly written film ever released through a major studio .  producer dean devlin and director roland emmerich should be ashamed of themselves , and as penance be forced to return to film school to watch "" last year at merienbad "" until they can grasp the idea of content and plot .  no amount of hype , no amount of money can hide the fact that these filmmakers are the 90s equivalent to william beaudine ( billy the kid vs .  dracula ) .   "" godzilla "" opens with stock footage of the bikini atoll nuclear tests interspersed with footage of iguanas playfully swimming and nuzzling their eggs .  we are then introduced to the crew of a japanese fish canning ship ( a questionable enterprise considering that tuna processing is supposed to be supervised to eliminate the netting of dolphins ) .  well , the ship is attacked and sunk by an unseen creature .  later , a group of frenchmen led by philippe roache ( jean reno ) interview the sole survivor .  in a state of shock , the only thing the man can utter is the word "" gojira "" ( the japanese name of the famed beast ) .  we are then introduced to dr . nick tatopoulos ( matthew broderick , with a moniker obviously taken from the effects designer of the film ) .  he is currently studying the effects that the chernobyl disaster has had on the local earthworm population .  he is immediately drafted by the u . s . military and taken to panama where he is shown the huge footprints of a creature .  in a short amount of time , another fishing boat ( loaded with canned tuna from the u . s . and korea for some reason ) is found grounded in jamaica .  well , it seems that whatever is eating these ships is headed for new york .  when the beast finally appears , he tears up one building , stomps a couple of trucks and makes life hell for the incumbent mayor ebert ( thumbs up for new york ) .  the military , with dr . tatopoulos's help , have two tons of fresh fish dumped in the middle of new york to lure the beast out of its hiding place in the new york subway system .  it finally comes crashing through the city streets and has a cute face to face with dr . tatopoulos who snaps the beast's picture .  the monster eats the fish , the military starts shooting , and the chase is on , with the army causing 90% of the ensuing damage .  working from a hunch as to why godzilla has decided to come to the big apple , dr . totopoulos buys a few home pregnancy kits from a local drugstore that has chosen to remain open ( even though new york has been evacuated ) .  well the test proves that the monster is a hermaphrodite and is pregnant .  needless to say , no one believes the good doctor about his discovery , so he must join up with the renegade french secret service agents and find the monster's nesting site and destroy the eggs before the mayor starts letting the populous back into the city ( even though the monster isn't dead yet ) .  i sincerely hope that i've completely spoiled any interest anyone might have of seeing this film .  i gave away the relevant plot so that i could spare those of you courageous ( or foolish ) enough to drop down an hour's wage on this tripe .  everything about "" godzilla "" reeks almost as bad as the piles of rotting fish used to trap the beast .  the script ( and let's be clear here ) by devlin and emmerich is so full of plot holes and non characters as to be sure to be the recipient of next years "" razzie "" award .  the dialogue between maria pitillo ( as audrey timmonds , dr . tatopoulos' estranged girlfriend ) and mr . broderick is so adolescent , it makes teenagers giggle in disbelief ( as happened during the screening i witnessed ) .  the film could be enjoyably campy if it didn't take itself so damn seriously .  but to what end , as there is no commentary on humanities foibles against nature , nor is there any reference about godzilla being some sort of retaliation against mankind .  no . godzilla is just a big dummy that got knocked up by some french immigrants and decided to let the state of new york pay for it .  the film is bleak and ugly looking .  taking place at night during a rain storm , the movie has little or no depth .  everything is ugly and dark .  new york has never looked so inhospitable since "" death wish "" .  in an attempt to give the film some color , audrey timmonds carries a bright red umbrella which is unique in that everyone else in the film carries the standard gray issue .  the only moment of composition and color is during the brief scenes on jamaica , where dr . tatopoulos finds himself standing in a giant footprint .  the scene is nicely photographed but poorly set up .  you know from the outset that nick is standing in a footprint .  for a scientist , this is very poor observation .  let's look at some of the more interesting plot holes in the film ( this activity , is becoming almost as popular as the kevin bacon game ) :  1 . ) why does the french nuclear tests only affect one clutch of iguana eggs , and how do those eggs fuse into one beast ?  2 . ) why would a cold blooded creature choose a cold climate ( such as new york ) to nest ?  i don't think iguana's have a habit of migrating .  3 . ) how can godzilla crawl through the new york subway system , slice a submarine in half , yet be unable to extricate himself from some thin ( in comparison ) steel cable on the brooklyn bridge ?  4 . ) the brooklyn bridge is the only suspension bridge in existence that does not need it's suspension cables .  5 . ) did godzilla carry all two hundred eggs in her belly ?  if so , then radioactive mutations surely are wondrous creatures .   ( note : each egg is 10 feet tall and almost as wide .  godzilla would have to be over 1 , 000 feet tall to carry them all ) .  6 . ) godzilla can crush ships and eat helicopters , but new york cabs are made of stronger steel .  7 . ) godzilla can out maneuver helicopters , bullets , torpedoes and missiles , but can't catch you on foot .  8 . ) taxis can out maneuver godzilla .  9 . ) godzilla can burrow through the subway system but can't tear through the park avenue tunnel .  10 . ) why was nothing else mutated by the nuclear test as quickly as godzilla ?  maybe a giant hermit crab in the sequel .  11 . ) galapagos iguana's actually live in the french polynesian islands ?  12 . ) why was dr . tatopoulos brought in by the military if they were not going to listen to him anyway ?  13 . ) how did they evacuate new york island in less than a day , and how did they convince those new yorkers to go to new jersey ?  14 . ) new york television stations use vhs tape for both filming and broadcasting .  new yorkers hate beta cam .  i could go on and on , but that would only serve to make the film seem more enjoyable than it is .  don't be fooled , this film has less gray matter than any episode of "" america's funniest home videos "" .  the performances in the film are singularly bland .  not one performance belays any awe or fear in the face of this two hundred foot tall terror .  the characters , in the midst of the onslaught , have time to stop and discuss the lack of good coffee , failed relationships , career choices .  the only common occurrence that doesn't take place here is having one of the characters have a bowel movement , but then that would have made them believable .  godzilla for the most part is okay .  the design of the beast is funky , if not very memorable .  one thing that comes to mind-- the major redirection of godzilla in this film is to remove his most familiar trademark , namely his atomic breath .  now , i for one can't quite fathom how you can call this monster godzilla without that little trait .  a good comparison would be to make a superman film and eliminate his ability to fly .  there is so much wrong with this film that i can't really recall anything recently that has left me this cold hearted ( except for my divorce ) .  any film that can have a two ton lizard slipping on gum balls has got to be envisioned under the influence of prozac .  the addition of the baby raptors ( ah , i meant godzillas ) , are nothing but a direct rip off of 'jurassic park "" , but with none of that film's suspense or tension .  suffice to say that , "" godzilla "" is without a doubt the most brain dead motion picture of the decade .  this is a film that needed the hype .  with the current level of writing and directing , nothing else about the film succeeds .  if you've seen the trailers , you've seen the best parts .  my only suggestion for mr . d and mr . e . is that they could always go back to selling shoes .   . this film could be the next "" rocky horror "" .  only it's not funny !

0|woody allen is one of the most successful artist-directors in hollywood , but he is becoming less and less reliable as a filmmaker .  in his early years of film-making he mastered the simple comedy .  from there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles .  some of these work better than others .  zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist .  deconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back .  harry block ( allen ) has in his life only two drives .  he wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing .  the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments .  perhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harry's life by editing harry's scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out .  as a writer , harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises .  the film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harry's books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harry's life .  these fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion , but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters .  it is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person .  if that sounds complicated , it is .  then as another device in one of the stories , an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image .  harry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time .  as if these touches did not create sufficient confusion , the story is told out of chronological order .  if allen were giving the audience a story that was worth decoding , any and all of these stylistic touches could be excusable .  but allen puts the audience through all of this to give us a portrait of harry block who is a selfish manipulator who is not worth the effort to understand .  deconstructing harry is set at a time when harry's old college , the one that expelled him when he attended it , wants now to honor him for a lifetime of writing achievement .  harry is searching among his friends to find one who will go with him .  just why someone who is so unwilling to commit to a relationship with anyone suddenly needs the support of someone else is unclear .  harry tries his current girl friend fay ( elizabeth shue ) only to find that she is about to marry harry's old friend larry ( billy crystal ) .  block would like his son hilly ( eric lloyd ) to accompany him , but hilly's mother , previously first harry's psychiatrist and more recently his wife , refuses to let her son see his father .  another friend richard ( bob balaban ) would go but has health problems .  harry also considers bringing a prostitute cookie ( hazel goodman ) .  it is interesting that allen should introduce another likable prostitute so soon after mighty aphrodite , but cookie is considerably different--black and a lot brighter than mira sorvino's character in the previous film .  while the comedy sequences are never complete , a few are elaborate and some quite funny .  the centerpiece of the film is a journey into hell with allen playing a sort of orpheus rescuing fay from the clutches of the devil , who looks a lot like larry .  that story also is left uncompleted , perhaps to show harry's unwillingness to commit even to telling a story .  the linchpin that was needed to tie together the stylistic quirks of this film was a central character who changes and who gives us something about which to care .  that character is patently not the one allen creates in harry block and not the characters around harry as seen through his acerbic eyes .  allen can do much better than deconstructing harry .  i rate it a 3 on the 0 to 10 scale and a -1 on the -4 to +4 scale .  |-0.5666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|0.30000000000000004|"The author expresses a negative sentiment towards Woody Allen's work, criticizing him as a filmmaker and specifically disapproving of the movie ""Deconstructing Harry"".

0|here's a rarity : a children's film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject , is there a god ?  done well , it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children's cinema .  unfortunately , it isn't .  with jumbled messages , and an unclear audience , wide awake was better left asleep .  fifth grader joshua beal ( joseph cross ) is in the middle of a moral crisis .  his beloved grandfather ( robert loggia ) has died , and joshua has begun a quest .  he wants to find god , to discover why bad things happen .  this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents ( dana delany and denis leary ) , but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths .  at his catholic school , his favorite teacher , sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , tries to give him guidance , but this is a journey he must make on his own .  meanwhile , he is having the most momentous year of his life .  he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave ( timothy reifsnyder ) , he gets his first crush , and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey .  it is somewhat confusing as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be .  on its surface , it appears to be a kid's film .  however , it deals with serious issues , and is likely to be boring for today's instant-gratification kids .  and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience , wide awake asks serious questions , but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer .  if there were a bit more meat in the story , adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie .  the actors who might have created a great cast ( o'donnell , leary and delany ) are wasted in roles that amount to little more than cameos .  the nostalgic elements ( best friend , favorite teacher , first crush , etc . ) have been done much better in other movies , and actually seem more like filler here .  the film's strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua's relationship with his grandfather .  they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie .  maybe the film would have been better if , instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks , it were set entirely during joshua's last year with his grandpa .  it certainly would have been more entertaining .  wide awake can best be described as a failed experiment .  it starts out with noble aspirations , but never delivers on its promise .  parents who do take their children to see this one ought to be prepared to answer some tough questions . . . that is if their kids aren't bored to death first .  |-0.5666666666666668|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|The overall sentiment is negative as the film is criticized for being unsuccessful in tackling weighty subject matter, having jumbled messages, confusing target audience, wasting the actors' talent, and not delivering on its promise.
0|"there's no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based , as its opening credits proclaim , on a true story .  but if it's an accurate picture of life on america's mean streets , than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought .  for from the film's outset , when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles ( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading ) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction .  our eponymous hero ( johnny depp ) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be .  brasco is joseph pistone , an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming-up to lefty ( al pacino ) , a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a "" wiseguy "" .  regrettably , pistone learns his lessons all too well .  his concern for lefty , who is burdened with a heroin addicted son , exacerbates his own family troubles : his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband's gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing .  true , the focus on pistone's family life does deviate from the typical gangster-flick formula , but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins .  the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn-out domestic squabbles ? including an ill-advised marriage guidance routine ? that slow the film down unnecessarily .  the biggest problem with donnie brasco , however , is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors .  the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70's , but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style ? i loved those fluoro coloured suits ? of scorces' costume drama casino .  more importantly , pacino's presence triggers memories of his earlier movie triumphs in which similar territory was covered far more effectively .  donnie brasco's take on american values , for instance , is feeble and obvious .  lefty rambles out dreams of material betterment to the accompaniment of grating inspirational music .  inexplicably , lefty's horatio alger inspired gush is supposed to move us .  it doesn't any more than his family troubles do , which are dealt in the same saccharine and obvious manner as pistone's .  just think a minute on how these themes were explored in the godfather movies and scarface .  in these pictures pacino's dedication to a peculiar and bloody hyper-capitalism was twisted and confronting , while his dogged application of macho wiseguy procedure meant that his relations to friends and family was intriguingly dark ? neither were spared bloody retribution for breaching wiseguy regulations .  donnie brasco's tawdry little crime , therefore isn't so much its repetition of familiar gangster themes , but the shameless way in which it sanitises them .   ( oh and by the way , i forgot to mention that the script also sports a startling subplot : pipstone's superiors are obstructive incompetents who are infuriated by his constant insubordination ? is that a "" damn you mcbain ! ""  i hear from springfield way ? )  so the movie is cliched .  big deal , what do you expect from a gangster-flick ?  well you expect quality action sequences and bravado performances in abundance if its going to be a decent example of the genre .  donnie brasco fails on both counts .  the action scenes never rise above the ordinary and depp's woeful performance tends to smother the good-work of his comrades .  admittedly , pacino does nothing new and michael madsen ( sonny ) simply smirks his way through the picture like a slightly subdued mr . white , but both possess an unmistakable sly charm .  depp usually exhibits a bit of class himself , but regrettably , being in the presence of one of his betters must have left him star-struck , for he is completely hell-bent on mimicking pacino's well-earned high style .  the consequences are painful to watch .  its no exaggeration to say that the film's credibility is seriously strained by the sight of the pistone family's uncanny ability to keep a straight face in front of their breadwinner's phony brooklyn accent .  perhaps we should take pity on the makers of donnie brasco .  maybe a scrupulous adherence to pinpoint accuracy demanded tiered dialogue and scenarios weakly reminiscent of classic gangster flicks .  if this is indeed the case , surely the makers of donnie brasco could have explored the fascinating possibility that america's underworld is committed to emulating , albeit in heavily attenuated form , their movie namesakes .  depp could have poignantly played a simple cop who becomes a hideous parody once he is forced to mimic big-screen gangster greats .  who knows what insights into the criminal psyche could have arisen ?  but then again , perhaps donnie brasco isn't so true after all .

0|"these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes .  but , only a few years ago , before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice , sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers .  sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south .  the way to regain popularity and prestige , they thought , was the use the same formulas , characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place .  one of such celebrity was eddie murphy , black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade .  in order to return to the spotlight , he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film , beverly hills cop , 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987 .  seven years later , for the third instalment , he used the directorial service of john landis , another fading star , with whom he successfully collaborated twice - in trading places and coming to america .  this time , however , third time wasn't the charm and beverly hills iii was failure .  eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback .  eddie murphy here plays axel foley , fast-talking streetwise detroit policeman , who raids illegal chop shop .  the routine police action ends in tragedy , when the criminals kill foley's boss .  determined to bring the killers to justice , foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald ( timothy carhart ) .  when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles , foley goes back to los angeles .  there , with the help of his old friend , local policeman rosewood ( judge rheinhold ) , foley would clash with money counterfeit ring .  ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different .  in this decade , the contrast between blue collar detroit and yuppie beverly hills , which provided a lot of gags in 1984 film , simply doesn't work .  screenwriter steven e . de souza provides another conflict , this time between the childish sillyness of the good guys and business-like professionalism of the bad guys .  since foley belongs to the former , his character had to watch his language , and the tone of the film in general is more infantile .  unfortunately , this film still belongs to action movie genre , and there is too much violence for little children .  nice example is the humorous scene in the beginning , which turns into standard ramboesque bloodbath .  unlike donner with the lethal weapon series , landis simply can't balance the comedy with "" regular "" action , and the result is a film that fails in both aspects .  action scenes are sometimes interesting , but not too spectacular ( at the end , scenery of wonderland is more fascinating than the action itself ) ; humour , on the other hand , falls flat .  to make even worse , some minor characters from 1984 film gets unnecessary and sometimes irritating overexposure ( especially art expert turned into arms dealer , played by bronson pinchot ) .  in the end , although the film provided some entertainment , viewers , at least critical ones , would probably be happy to know that there aren't any plans for beverly hills iv .

0|"i have never been so confused after watching a movie .   "" meet joe black "" is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year , with a cinematography , music and cast that will dazzle most of us .  at the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season .  at first you marvel at the elegant direction , graceful cinematography and sensual musical score .  then you'll wait for something to happen for half an hour , but when you finally understand what's going on , you'll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins , brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this ?  the script is simply a silly and unresolved story , which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture .  it feels like an eternity .  most of the time it is a pompous soap opera , filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and "" meaningful "" winks .  the film is based on alberto caesella's play "" death takes a holiday "" .  the story concentrates around bill ( anthony hopkins ) who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man , but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying "" yes "" .  soon he meets a young elegant gentlemen ( brad pitt ) who introduces himself as "" death "" .  it is bill's time .  but death has other plans .  it has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive .  our bill is chosen to be death's guide and in exchange he gets time .  bill introduces death as joe black , who immediately becomes the center of everyone's attention .  bill's business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill's side , lives in his house and resides at his office .  that is not all , however .  bill's youngest daughter susan ( claire forlani ) falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her .  this relationship is bound to have some serious consequences .  it wouldn't be fair to say that this film didn't have some interesting moments , such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill's family for dinner .  when joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love , the experience is somewhat different .  it is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure .  it's one thing to say : "" wouldn't it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth . . ""  to create a motion picture out of this is another .  four screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic .  it is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film .  on the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest ( "" scent of a woman "" ) .  hopkins looks great in any role , and no matter how shallow or hollow it is , he will complete it .  his talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else , since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment .  but pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time .  how can you play death in human form ?  to me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters .  they are not creatures , but phenomenas .  saying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form .  handling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work .  speaking in a calm , soft voice , portraying death as a lonely , distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters .  he looks and acts more like an angel of death , rather than a demon or a red-eyed executioner .  claire forlani and others are also fine , stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits .  unfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery .  in other words this is not what i expected from the director of "" scent of a woman "" .  it could ( and should ) be better with such cast and crew .  in the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera .

0|keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival .  on the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater .  they need not have wasted their time .  the movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor .  there are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click .  i wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either .  keep cool just isn't very funny .  the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii .  although the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost .  too bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh .  qu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments .  however , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms . ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade .  it was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film .  you see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes .  at least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving .  cinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another .  although some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying .  headache , as i said .  the film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying ) .  they used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship .  the first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back .  of course the thing is , she doesn't want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit .  in the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost .  we later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced .  there is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses .  there is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character .  the bookseller would be better off without her .  although the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man .  while the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation .  his quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time .  a friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate .  although only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material .  the whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don't see her from the midpoint on .  a case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller's boring pursuit during the first half .  but of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour .  there are a few things that keep cool does right .  as mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good .  although it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations .  in one scene , for example , the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted , and that it means something entirely different .  also effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner .  the nightclub owner is counting out money , slapping each bundle of currency on the table .  with every shot of his hand , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge .  unfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film's shortcomings , and weren't enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater .  |-0.2333333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|The reviewer expresses disappointment with the lack of humor, finds the camera work distracting and annoying, criticizes the plot and character development, and mentions a headache after watching the film, emphasizing the negative sentiment.

0|"plunkett & macleane is a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions .  i have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking -- used properly it can save a movie ( see stigmata ) -- but it ruins this one , making a muddled , incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise .  there are certain genres that just don't go together .  the film opens with a sequence that i still don't understand .  it involves some sort of prison outbreak , a robbery , and a gem that keeps being eaten .  in any case , the caper ( whatever it may be ) brings together plunkett and macleane ( robert carlyle and johnny lee miller , respectively ) , two happy-go-lucky brits with no way to make a living .  they make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to america .  their first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca ( liv tyler ) ; a woman macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier .  his decorum when stripping her of her valuables earns our two crooks the name "" gentleman highwaymen . ""  lady rebecca also happens to be the niece of the lord chief justice , a glaringly arrogant man nearing the end of his political career .  he demands that the robbers be caught and punished immediately , leaving the job in the hands of the devious chance ( ken stott ) who has a few more things on his mind than catching criminals .  meanwhile , macleane falls in love with rebecca infuriating the businesslike plunkett , who doesn't want his plans to be foiled by his partner's mindless romantic travails .  director jake scott , son of ridley scott ( alien , blade runner ) , has his father's knack for setting up atmospheric shots but none of his skill in actually moving the camera .  most of the action scenes are filmed in such a rapid , jerky way that it's impossible to comprehend what's going on .  the camerawork is even more nauseating than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity .  instead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attention-deficit-disorder edits .  he barely ever holds a shot for more than ten seconds and during the faster scenes it seems more like a couple frames between each cut .  the weird , almost defiant lack of dialogue ( there are no -- no -- conversations lasting over , say , 20 seconds ) undermines character definition and our two protagonists come off as ciphers rather than characters .  the love affair between macleane and rebecca is no different , emotionless and unrealistic .  when the script calls for macleane to decide between going to america and going to meet his lover , there is no reason for us to believe it would be worth it for him to abandon his goal ; he and rebecca barely even speak to each other throughout the film .  plunkett and macleane wants desperately to be a triumph of style over substance but since its style , quite frankly , blows , the film has no hope of succeeding on any level .  i wanted to appreciate this movie on the basis of its admittedly kinetic pace but i couldn't -- it was so kinetic it gave me a headache .

0|" * this review contains spoilers * as with most of her films , director amy heckerling's latest , loser , seesaws between unpleasant and artificial , and is sometimes both at once .  when she tackles big issues , such as abortion in fast times at ridgemont high , it's impossible to tell whether she's being matter-of-fact or glib about them ( they carry an almost documentary starkness ) , but whatever the case , she continually refuses to comment politically .  such is the sitcom tendency of her work : to jeopardize the innocence of her characters and then hit the reset button .  this fear of drama soured me on fast times . . . , look who's talking , clueless , and now loser , in which ms . heckerling also demonstrates , for the first time , zero affinity for the milieu .  has anyone , for instance , ever met a girl in the stylistic vein of mena suvari's dora ?  attired in black thrift , her eye shadow smeared to racoon chic and her bangy red hair barely contained by girlish clips , she accepts the label of goth , but no self-respecting goth girl ever admitted to digging , as dora does , those geriatric rockers everclear , nor willingly went anywhere with a six-pack-wielding fratboy stranger .  the mechanics of loser's tired old introvert-boy-falls-for-extrovert-girl plot drive its protagonists into cultural non-specificity , so that they become even less than stereotypes .  they become walking wardrobes .  small-town transplant paul ( a strangely static jason biggs ) , our eponymous hero , always wears his woolly hunter's cap with flaps covering the ears , and beneath it rests a parted moptop that couldn't scream "" shemp "" ( the lame stooge ) wig louder .  he has three smug-looking roommates ( the one-dimensional trio is not supposed to be brothers , but they share similar facial features , including and especially mouths ) , and their fashion sense is incomprehensibly glam .  though they're not overtly transvestites , heckerling seems to be equating flamboyance with villainy ; how very cruising of her .   ( the dormies conspire to evict paul and regularly molest women they have drugged .  dora ignorantly downs one of their date rape potions .  unfortunately , either heckerling or the studio is too cowardly to admit if she was subsequently violated . )  when paul rescues dora from said narcotic scare , he learns that she is dating their unctuous european lit professor edward alcott ( superb greg kinnear ) .  although paul's already in love with dora by this point , as is bound to happen to losers when pretty girls address them by name , he gets altruistic and pretends the flowers he bought her are actually from alcott .  she's thrilled , but nevertheless spends a few days at paul's to recuperate ; the two bond over emergency kitten surgery and a broadway play ( "" cabaret "" ) , and just when paul's got in his head that she's starting to love him back in that non-friendly way , she decides to become alcott's live-in girlfriend .  cue precious hommage to the graduate , shots of paul drifting around berkeley--er . . .   ( aside : simon & garfunkel's "" parsley , sage , rosemary & thyme "" should never have been allowed in another motion picture . )  heckerling has a lot in common with nora "" you've got mail "" ephron , the only other prominent chick directing comedies today , in that neither has any use for strong-willed women .  men continue to trod on dora until the bitter end ( in the final scene , she gives paul a big smooch after he blurts out his feelings in what amounts to a creepy ultimatum ) , and dora ultimately shrugs off being drugged against her will--mere hours after paul hints to her that she was poisoned , she's cheerily redecorating his apartment .   ( heckerling is so laissez-faire about the issue in general that she reserves the comeuppance of the would-be rapists for jokey epilogue titles . )  goth veneer aside , there are an awful lot of girls out there who behave as erratically as dora , and enough angry young dude filmmakers to make movies about them .  heckerling misses her shot at having dora transform herself into a role model , and while such arcs may not be heckerling's social responsibility , it is a privilege i would have taken advantage of if i were in her shoes .   ( consider , too , that dora is the film's sole female principal . )  not that loser is worth contemplating this seriously--god knows heckerling didn't .  that is her hallmark .

0|fantastically over hyped , godzila finally lumbers onto the big screen .  the film opens with footage of nuclear testing on the french polynesian islands , then an attack on a boat from some beast , and finally we join dr . nick tatopoulos ( broderick looking about 17 years old ) doing some research in chernobyl .  some shady u . s government guys appear , and ask him to come to an island where they have massive footprints , from what looks like a giant lizard .  and what's more , this beast is heading for new york .  gulp !  although godzilla should be a non stop roller coaster ride , and at some points it is , there is something curiously uninvolving and unexciting about this movie .  the main faults lie with the acting and writing , common problems with 'summer blockbuster' movies .  broderick is pretty useless as the hero , with no humour or a 'tough guy' image .  while emmerich's previous summer flick , independence day ( 1996 ) had wisecracks and action from jeff goldblum and will smith , this has neither .  also , maria pitillo , as broderick's former girlfriend , is just as useless , with a chronic disability in acting .  she's incapable of showing emotion , speaks every line in the same way , and basically she's total crap .  it's up to french actor jean reno to save the day , and indeed he does , turning in a campy performance as a french secret agent .  shame he has such little screen time in such a overlong film .  hank azaria also turns up as a crazy cameraman named 'animal' , and he adds a little life to the picture .  also making an appearance is harry shearer ( probably best know for doing voices in the simpsons ) as a slimy news reporter .  o . k , so the acting is not up to par , but it never is in these movies .  but what about the script ?  well , that's not up to par either .  emmerich and screenwriting pal dean devlin seem so caught in the destruction of new york city that they forgot to write a script .  the dialogue is banal ( broderick looks at a lot of fish and utters 'that's a lot of fish . ' ) , and the character development is non existent ( reno plays the typical frenchman ( 'no croissant ? ' ) ,  broderick forever remains a geeky scientist . )  also , the film is seriously lacking a sense of humour .  the jokes that are uttered are pathetic , and there's an 'hilarious' running gag about siskel and ebert .   ( the mayor is mayor ebert , and is assistant is called gene !  ha ha ha ha ! . )  the plot is dire , and in the end just rips off jurassic park ( 1993 ) by having lots of baby godzilla's ( i . e .  velicorapters ) running around new york .  right , so the script and acting suck .  but what about the special effects ?  thankfully , they're are quite good .  godzilla is an impressive piece of cgi , although we don't see much of him because the movie is so dark .  the destruction of new york is pretty well done aswell .  but although they are impressive , they can't save godzilla from being an hugely disappointing and boring movie .  the movie goes on for far too long aswell , and it can't seem to decide on a ending .  and of course , the ending itself leaves possibility for a sequel .  let's just hope one never arrives .  |-0.8000000000000002|0.9|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment towards the movie ""Godzilla"" is negative, as the reviewers critique various aspects including the acting, writing, script, character development, humor, and express disappointment and boredom, concluding that the film is hugely disappointing, overhyped, and lacking in engagement."

0|"whether or not i would be considered a trekker probably depends on whom you would ask .  i have been a fan of both the original series and its recently retired follow-up , as well as the even- numbered entries in the film series .  however , i have never been one of those folks who store away trek minutiae and get into debates over the relative merits of spock vs . data .  somewhere along the line , the "" star trek "" film series began to seem more and more directed at those in the latter category , and star trek : generations may be the natural conclusion of this direction .  its production values may be high , but the writing is frequently appalling , and instead of a script has a collection of references , in-jokes and ill-defined characters .  generations opens in the late 23rd century , where members of the original enterprise crew , including captain james t . kirk ( william shatner ) , are present for the christening of the latest ship to bear that name .  no sooner is it out on its maiden voyage than a distress signal brings them to the nexus , a mysterious ribbon of energy .  among those rescued from the nexus is long-lived alien dr . soran ( malcolm mcdowell ) , but he is none-too-pleased at being back in the real world .  seventy-eight years later , soran is still trying to get back to the nexus , and again encounters an enterprise , this one led by captain jean-luc picard ( patrick stewart ) .  soran's plan involves destroying a star with an inhabited planet , and the only hope for saving 230 million people is the historic meeting of two enterprise captains .  i don't think it is an insult to fans of "" star trek "" to suggest that to a certain extent , the particulars of a plot are not really the most important elements in a "" trek "" film .  it's about a chance to visit with old friends , and if they are involved in a truly interesting story it can be considered gravy .  but even that interpretation assumes that characterization has to be consistent , and in generations that just doesn't happen .  data ( brent spiner ) is particularly victimized by this sloppy writing .  in the film's major sub-plot , data decides to use a chip which will give him human emotions , a chip he has had in his possession for over a year .  what is his motivation for taking this drastic and perhaps dangerous step ?  he doesn't get a joke .  once the chip is in place , spiner gets to have a lot of fun with data's new emotions , but the point is that he's no longer the data we know .  if the rest of the "" next generation "" cast fares any better , it's only because they're on the screen so little that they're simply window dressing .  but then again , this story isn't really about the new crew .  it's about kirk and picard , the cowboy and the politician , sharing the screen .  the huge surprise is that william shatner blows patrick stewart away .  perhaps because he knows this is his last go-round in the part that made him a legend , shatner looks like he's having the time of his life ; stewart , on the other hand , borders on the deferrential , and is saddled with the same lackluster motivations as everyone else in the cast .  stewart's edginess is indicative of what may be a very bad sign for paramount's hopes to turn the new cast into the same kind of franchise the original cast was : these are clearly the not ready for big screen players .  by contrast , the prologue which features scotty ( james doohan ) and chekhov ( walter koenig ) is the highlight of the film .  these characters have become part of the popular mythology , and when they take over the enterprise in a moment of distress , it's a moment of high energy .  only thirty years of history can create a moment like that , and that's time this new crew doesn't have .  it certainly doesn't help that the plot they are stuck in is so convoluted and badly constructed that you need to leave a trail of bread crumbs to find your way out again .  it's also loaded with little gags all aimed at those who are familiar enough with the series to turn to all their friends in a shared nudge of recognition .  i wonder whether anyone who is coming in cold to the "" trek "" universe at this point would be anything but baffled and bored by what is going on .  and what a waste of malcolm mcdowell , who could have been a great monomanical villain but should have been given a much more compelling reason for his obsession .  there are plenty of details both scientific and of continuity to pick at , but to do so would be to ignore generations' major flaws .  however , i would like to make one recommendation : seatbelts .  not just for the enterprise crew , although you'd think by the 24th century space travel wouldn't involve rolling around on the floor during a battle .  no , i think the audience might need them more .  this journey is one bumpy ride .

0|"they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie's poster : "" no sequel . ""  scary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor , and it is not because the wayans brothers , shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera , don't try .  what defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof .  the first movie - an outrageous , low-brow , savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream and i know what you did last summer - succeeded because of its take-no-prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue , familiar and popular .  in scary movie 2 , the filmmakers take on the haunted house-ghost story format which , if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill , did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series .  scary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist , featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn .  of course split pea soup is the punch line - an overabundant amount , which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive .  but this pre-credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action , which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project .  some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original , but they lack that take-no-prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque .  scary movie 2 merely lurches from one lame sendup to another , offering weak spoofs of that nike shoe ad in which everyone does acrobatics with a basketball , and the films what lies beneath and hannibal ( features that only faired adequately at the box office ) , john woo's mission : impossible 2 and charlie's angels .  it is as if the wayans and their team of writers - at least seven are credited - just threw ideas in a blender and hoped they'd coalesce .  they don't .  while the pace of the original left you breathless , the sequel moves with the speed of an 18-wheeler carrying two tons of concrete up a steep mountain road .  you can almost hear the reels panting .  scary movie 2 tries very hard to live up to its original , but it falls very short .  it's a dissatisfying spectacle , a very weak sister of a very good movie .  the really scary aspect of this sequel is how disappointing it really is .

0|"vikings v . bears ?  no , this isn't the lineup for monday night football .  rather , these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in "" the 13th warrior , "" a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory .  based on michael crichton's book , eaters of the dead , this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought .  their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword .  luckily for the vikings , however , their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film .  antonio bandaras is ahmed , a travelling ambassador .  accompanied by his friend ( omar shariff in a cameo ) , they eventually come across a small viking village .  we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude .  they laugh heartily , revel in their arrogance , and sing songs of battles won .  but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land .  help is needed quickly .  an elderly , fortune-telling witch arrives .  after a brief incantation , she proclaims that 12 warriors and one more "" not of norse blood "" are needed to ensure victory .  personally , i always wonder why people believe these oracles when they look so haggardly and on the brink of insanity .  nonetheless , 12 men eagerly accept their place while ahmed becomes the pivotal 13th .  the group then sets out to do the greatest battle of their lives .  of course during their ride , ahmed becomes the target of fun for the other 12 burly viking warriors .  but he ably shows that it's not the size of the dog in the fight but rather the size of the fight in the dog .  he is able to overcome the proud arrogance of the vikings , but will his skills ( and that of the group ) be enough to defeat whatever evil is menacing the countryside ?  it does not look promising .  these creatures , resembling bears , are strong and have high morale .  they are fearless and display a desire for decapitating the heads of their enemies .  they attack by the hundreds and the next strike will come soon .  the warriors prepare their defenses and pray to their gods .  they are ready to sacrifice their lives .   "" this is a good way to die , "" says one of the fallen warriors .  despite the larger-than-life battle sequences , i was unmoved by the entire experience .  at many points , i was even confused .  for example , somewhere in the middle of the film , a sub-plot creeps up involving the prince of the threatened land .  he seems to have an agenda to elevate himself to greater power during this crisis .  however , the sub-plot never fully materializes , and we are left scratching our heads as to the purpose of its inclusion .  there are other questions that i had , but the real problem was that the story ( little of it that there was ) offered no characters to love or hate .  the leader of the viking warriors had the most charisma .  however , banderas's role is completely underwritten and it is unclear why being the 13th warrior makes him so special .  an entire rewrite of the ahmed character is in order .  also , much of the action takes place during torrential downpours or at night , which made battles very difficult to follow .  i would have preferred more time looking at the viking culture and how their beliefs shaped their decision to do battle against the enemy .  as it stands , the film manages more confusion than intensity .  it would make thor cry .

0|"one of my favorite songs by the stranglers includes the lyric , "" you'd better watch out for the skin deep . ""  i'd like to extend the same warning : watch out for skin deep , but whatever you do don't watch skin deep .  skin deep is a tedious and uneven comedy written and directed by blake edwards .  john ritter stars as zach , a dried up writer and insatiable womanizer with a big-time drinking problem .  i never saw edwards' comedy the man who loved women , but i have to wonder whether skin deep is a remake .  you see , to put it mildly , zach goes to bed with just about each and every woman he meets .  as the movie opens , zach's wife , alex , catches him with not only his mistress but also his mistress' hairdresser .  like any sensible wife , alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him .  in response , zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking , womanizing , psychotherapy , and self-discovery .  if you're turned on by the idea of watching ritter drink , get arrested , have sex , drink , crash his mercedes , have more sex , drink , get arrested again , drink , and sing horrendously at the piano , then skin deep should be right up your alley .  skin deep makes the fatal mistake of inflicting on us unbelievable and unsympathetic characters .  zach is a rich , '80s l . a . version of ritter's jack tripper character from "" three's company . ""  like jack , zach is clumsy and inept ; he's the type of guy whose bad aim makes him accidently squirt breath freshener into his eye .  zach is supposed to be charming and charismatic , but i failed to see even one redeeming virtue in him .  consequently , i never felt the least bit of sympathy or pity for the philandering alcoholic during his moments of crisis .  in fact , when zach crashes his ex-wife's wedding in a desperate attempt to stop her from remarrying , i actually rooted for her to go through with the ceremony .  to add insult to injury , edwards gives his large supporting cast nothing but stereotypes with which to work .  for instance , vincent gardenia's talents are wasted in his role as the fatherly bartender .  of all the women in the film--and there are many--alyson reed , alone , stands out as zach's wife ; reed brings intelligence and sensitivity to the role .  because we don't care the slightest bit about anyone in skin deep , the film's few feeble attempts at drama inevitably fail .  the comedy in skin deep doesn't fare much better .  most of the jokes are dumb , predictable , and sitcomish .  about every ten minutes , however , edwards does manage to come up with a good line or a novel sight-gag , the most effective of which involves a pair of "" dueling "" condoms .  overall , the laughs in skin deep are just too infrequent and the characters just too shallow for the film to stay afloat .  my final criticism of the film lies in its glamorous depiction of alcohol and alcoholism .  zach's excessive drinking is clearly ruining his life , but nevertheless it seems to give him more pleasure than pain .  zach's drinking binges never have any truly serious or lasting consequences .  if he crashes his mercedes , he gets a new one .  if he gets arrested , his lawyer bails him out of jail .  if his wife leaves him , she will eventually decide to give him a second chance if he'll clean up his act .  the tone in skin deep is all wrong ; edwards treats a very serious issue far too lightly , making a joke out of a problem that is no joking matter .  perhaps edwards should have studied dudley moore in arthur or , better yet , michael keaton in clean and sober before making skin deep .

0|this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground , despite some good performances from a basically competent cast .  eddie ( sean penn ) and maureen ( robin wright penn ) are a not-so-happily married couple down on their luck .  living in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city , they spend what little income they have at the local bar , owned by shorty ( stanton ) , eddie's best friend , and his wife georgie ( mazar ) .  maureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie's frequent disappearances .  on his return , he promises her the world and professes his undying love .  their manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows , as eddie disappears again .  like a junky craving the next high , maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high .  their relationship is further complicated by maureen's pregnancy .  she wants the baby and the father , but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter .  during one of eddie's absences , maureen is attacked by kiefer , her neighbor , who gets her drunk ( with her cooperation ) and then insists on intimacy .  she leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do -- not to her , but to kiefer .  she lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage .  he lashes out as she expects , and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months -- but in reality is 10 years .  during this decade , maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual , joey ( travolta , in a small role ) .  her life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her .  joey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband ( and father of two children ) and stability ( joey makes a good living , drives a cadillac , and they live in a large house in the suburbs ) and the love of her previous life .  she chooses her past , and sacrifices not only her new life but her old ( by giving up her and eddie's daughter to joey ) .  but the eddie that she knew is gone , replaced by a mere shell of the man he was .  maureen is herself a mere shell , more an automaton than a woman -- as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him .  perhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness ( or maybe the lack of sadness ) together , but the movie's denouement was not convincing .  |-0.5333333333333333|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|The text consistently describes a dysfunctional and negative relationship, lacking resolution, which contributes to an overall negative sentiment.

0|"the general's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film .  it's confusing to a critic when so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction .  that , however , is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller .  the punched-up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general's daughter has a brain in its head , even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense .  our hero is warrant officer paul brenner , a brash investigator for the u . s . army's criminal investigation division .  his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) at a georgia base , the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation .  complicating the case is the fact that capt . campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) , a war hero and potential vice-presidential nominee .  general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press , which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in .  teamed with rape investigator sarah sunhill ( madeleine stowe ) -- who , coincidentally enough , once had a romantic relationship with brenner -- brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain's past that make the case ever more sordid .  if only the sordidness were the worst of the general's daughter's problems .  scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary , their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered-light sleaze .  director simon west likely thinks he's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers , but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches , which is the film's fatal flaw .  it's a trend he continues for two hours , taking the story's few virtues and slapping a coat of moron-proof obviousness over them .  characters who may ( wink wink ) turn out to be villains are photographed in ominous shadow ; cutaway inserts of the captain campbell's still-living face after the corpse is uncovered insure against five-minute attention spans .  west just can't help himself from overdirecting every minute of the general's daughter .  he even turns a scene of footage shown on cnn into an excuse for slow-fade edits .  bubbling up from this overcooked stew are enough tasty lines to distract you from its smell .  the slickest scene finds brenner squaring off with captain campbell's mentor , a psychological warfare expert named moore ( james woods ) .  there's something invigorating about watching two smart actors playing smart characters firing honesty at one another .  indeed , travolta gets to sink his teeth into dozens of choice lines based on his delight at provoking authority figures ( to the local sheriff of the georgia county : "" shouldn't you be out night-sticking the colored folk ? "" ) .  even the lame device of brenner and sunhill's sexual history provides a few winning zingers .  goldman's dialogue can serve up a bigger laugh than you'll find in most so-called comedies .  dialogue , unfortunately , just isn't enough to make a quality script .  it's difficult to take a movie about a criminal investigation seriously when the investigators are both too stupid to solve it sooner ( an idiotic inability to recognize the nature of the crime scene ) and too lucky for it to last any longer ( not one but two occasions where brenner catches a vital piece of evidence out of the corner of his eye ) .  by the time the general's daughter wanders towards its over-wrought , psycho-in-the-rain finale , west's heavy hand has obliterated most of what made the film occasionally fun .  it's silly and pretentious film-making , but at least it provides a giggle or five .  goldman should tear the 15 decent pages out of this script and turn them into a stand-up routine .

0|"cradle will rock is the latest effort from director/actor tim robbins .  while he may have had an oscar worthy film back in 1995 ( dead man walking ) , he gets a little overconfident and sloppy here .  the story is confusing , and filled with many subplots , so i'll try my best and explain it as simply as possible .  the film is based on a "" mostly "" true story about a federal theater in the 1930s , that produced a play ( the cradle will rock ) that apparently was offensive to some , so the government shuts it down .  it's during the time of the depression , and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs , or are poor .  between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots , about those who work in theater , or those associated .  also along the way are some other messages mashed together to create an even more overwhelming experience .  tim robbin's just keeps piling on political views , and characters , that we just give up on the film , or in some cases walk out .  for robbin's it may be a nice achievement , but to me it seemed more like a friendly get together with slightly more sophisticated dialogue , and fancy outfits .  i thought the main reason for seeing the film would be for the outstanding cast , unfortunately are all uninteresting , except for a few .  let me recap what each important character does , so please bear with me ( it's the least you can do , especially if you were considering seeing this ) .  i'll begin with those involved with the play .  there's orson welles ( angus macfadyen ) who of course is the director of the play , the producer john houseman ( cary elwes ) , marc blitzstein ( hank azaria ) the writer of the play , emily watson , a woman who gets her break by playing the main part in cradle will rock .  outside the play there's the : ventriloquist ( bill murray ) who wants a relationship with a federal theater clerk ( joan cusack ) , another subplot involving a painter diego rivera ( ruben blades ) who's unhappy that his painting is too be destroyed by nelson rockefeller because he feels it to be an outrage ( john cusack ) .  there's a few other actresses and actors who have their own stories ( susan sarandon , philip baker hall too name a few ) but those that i mentioned , were the most significant to the story .  anyway , most of these talented hollywood stars were completely wasted , except for emily watson , who does another great job , and one of my personal favorite actors john cusack , who always delivers through thick and thin .  now although most of the film was weak to say the least , there were some nice moments and some involving subjects , but all this is overblown .  sure the free speech segment was a nice feature , but not when it becomes repetitive .  the whole film is like this , and it's basically nothing but a headache .  on the brighter side , tim robbin's direction was masterful .  his camera direction seemed reminiscent to the works of paul thomas anderson's latest magnolia , only smoother in my opinion , but even that can't make a movie that much better .  although it has it's moments ( not many of them , but they're there ) , cradle will rock stays true to it's title , because the cradle rocked too far and tipped over .
