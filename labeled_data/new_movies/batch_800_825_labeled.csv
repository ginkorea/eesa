1|those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables .  i don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel .  i haven't even seen that .  going into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical ) .  walking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material .  writer/director bille august's film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film .  liam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19-year prison sentence .  he is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior .  the priest's words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself .  nine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago .  conflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo .  valjean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict .  javert is hell-bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice .  along the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes ) .  les miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture .  the production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don't look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci's costumes are noticeably spectacular .  basil poledouris' soundtrack is thick and usually well-placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times ) .  many scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening .  augusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow .  he manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately .  i was also impressed that he didn't go overboard with flash and style , which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days ( such as baz luhrmann's vicious tragedy william shakespeare's romeo + juliet ) .  this film feels solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested .  liam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective .  thurman , in her small role , is very good , and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non-glamorous role such as this one .  rush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense .  i can't be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit .  les miserables is , as i've said , a solid , intelligent motion picture .  my only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged .  each scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be .  for the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture .  it's a good movie , and tells its story well , but august tends to hand-feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle .  however , in a film this exciting and well-produced , a few minor flaws are easily overlooked .  |0.41333333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|The film receives a slightly positive sentiment due to praise for Liam Neeson's performance, solid production design, and straightforward storytelling, but is criticized for lacking subtlety and feeling too easy. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the minor flaws.
1|"this is a stagy film adapted from roger rueff's play "" hospitality suite . ''its  about three travelling salesmen attending an industrial convention , whose chicago company has sent them to wichita , where the company has paid all their expenses for them to rent a hospitality suite on the 16th floor of the hotel , where they aim to score a substantial account from the big kahuna , someone named dick fuller , who is the head of a big industrial corporation .  he is someone they have never met before , but they want to sell him industrial lubricants and they want desperately to land this new account , it is their only reason for coming to the convention .   "" the big kahuna "" revels in salesmen-talk among the three white christian males , two of them , larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department .  these three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their interactions in the hospitality suite .  the three salesmen have different things on their mind that is troubling them and a different attitude to their job , and they are each going through internal changes that are profoundly altering their life .  the outstanding cast tries to figure out in their own way what they are doing and why .  what comes into question is their opinions on life and death , on god and morality , and on how they make a living .  these are tough questions and the truth seems to be somewhere in their sales pitch .  their dialogue is acerbic , witty , and analytical .  following in the long tradition of salesmen films -- from death of a salesman , the tin men , and glengarry glen ross , as this film tries to get you to see what there is about salesmanship that gets these men high .  in this case , it is landing the big kahuna .  they each are trying to see why he's on top and why they are chasing after him .  what makes this film different than the others , is its blatant religious message , comparing orthodox religion to what they do , as both must sell their product .  and how after each one's psyche is stripped clean by the other , there is a pause and some lesson about life has sunk in that is pertinent to each .  the goal in the movie is not in literally landing the big kahuna , but in finding out what bill of goods they sold themselves that made them be salesmen .  larry and phil have one way of doing things and have no qualms of incorporating a sales pitch as part of their life .  bob thinks he is above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ .  his vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in .  bob is a baptist , who takes a very non-questioning and literal attitude about religion .  to just look at another woman and lust after her is a sin , according to the way he reads the bible .  when asked by larry why he married his wife , he seems puzzled and can't even say because he loves her , only that marriage is something sacred to him .  the contrast in their personalities is stark .  larry is all business , he simply wants to close the sale .  he comes into the room pumped for the convention , using his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman .  he criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out .  he tells him to go on a vacation .  get a woman .  while phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and is contemplating a career change , now that he is 52 and is painfully divorcing his wife , after having lived too lonely a life on the road for too long .  he now finds himself suffering from some troubling dreams and questioning what he believes in .  he has always been a charmer , shaking everyone's hand , trying to please his clients while trying to make the sale .  larry is more aggressive as a salesman , he is always a heart attack away from every big sale .  in contrast , bob is only in his twenties and everything seems fresh to him .  this is his first time for him on the road .  when dick fuller doesn't arrive at the party the salesmen throw , larry becomes confrontational and asks phil if he spoke to the man himself about the gathering .  when told that he spoke to the secretary , larry throws a tantrum and is resigned to going back to their home office without the new account .  but when they start talking to bob , whom they forced to act as the bartender , they are surprised to learn that fuller did indeed come but was wearing another man's name tag and that bob spent the entire evening consoling the tycoon over his recently deceased dog and then talking to him about jesus .  bob then tells the boys about a private party fuller is attending afterwards , and that he invited bob to attend .  larry and phil can't fathom how bob didn't make a sales pitch .  but they soon take another tact and decide to prep bob on how to get fuller's attention about their company's product as they sent him off to meet fuller , and will await his return in the hotel room .  these two sharp salesmen are reduced to waiting for this smug kid to come back and tell them he saved their ass .  the irony of their situation is played out in the darkness of the hotel room , as they stay up late into the night trying to make sense out of their lives .  these three performers were outstanding , each understanding what their role called for , each coming through with a marvelous performance .  the only problem with the film , is that its more of a play than a cinematic experience .  but the insightful dialogue and refreshing dramatics , give it an intelligent selling point and make it a good product to see .

1|"the coen brothers are back again , this time with homer's "" odyssey "" as the backdrop in their tale of three fugitives from a mississippi chain gang who trek across the south to find a secret treasure in "" o brother , where art thou ? ""  right for the beginning of "" o brother "" the coens grab your attention with a chain gang of prison inmates breaking rocks along the road in unison to a work song .  the camera flows around the hard toiling men , giving a visually exciting symmetry to the scene that ends with our three heroes - ulysses everett mcgill ( george clooney ) , delmar ( tim blake nelson ) and pete ( john turturro ) - escaping across a cotton field .  it is the beginning of a journey that takes on different meanings and urgencies to each member of the trio .  a strong suite , as always with the coen brothers , is the depth of character of the folks they create in their films .  their characters are goofy and comical , like nicolas cage in "" raising arizona "" ; or , dramatic , as albert finney and john turturro in "" miller's crossing "" ; and , even a mix of the two with frances mcdormand in "" fargo . ""  in all cases , and in "" o brother , "" too , the characters populating their films are three-dimensional people .  ulysses everett is a handsome , hair-obsessed petty criminal with a silver tongue and not a lot in the brains department .  but , he seems like a genius when compared to the simple , sweet delmar and the maladjusted pete , who follow their self appointed leader to a promised treasure of $1 . 2 million .  their odyssey takes on the mystical proportions of homer's original material as they meet all manner of people along the way , including those dangerous sirens who beckon them onto symbolically rocky shoals and a cyclops who beats them and takes all their money .  there is magic , too , when delmar believes that pete was turned into a horny toad by the sirens .  the story meanders through the different vignettes of the boys' adventures , giving the flick a choppy , episodic feel that disrupts the overall flow .  some of the interludes are an epiphany , though .  the trio becomes a quartet when they pick up guitar-playing tommy johnson ( chris thomas king ) and visit a radio station in the middle of nowhere , run by its blind owner ( stephen root ) .  they become the soggy bottom boys for the sightless radio station man and , without their knowledge , are recorded as they sing the traditional tune , "" i am a man of constant sorrow . ""  it is a wonderful moment of moviemaking and gives us , in my mind , the best movie song of the year .  contrasting this and other wonderful moments ( the sexy seduction by the sirens comes to mind ) are some pretentious bits that detract from the overall quality of "" o brother . ""  in particular , near the end , is a scene where ulysses , delmar and pete crash a ku klux klan rally to save tommy from being lynched .  the scene is overblown and flashy and reeks of "" the wizard of oz . ""  they don't say "" lions and tigers and bears , oh my ! ""  and there's no dorothy , but it is the land of oz we're seeing here .  the highs and lows of the story flow are tempered by fine acting on several levels .  george clooney is funny , charming , a little dumb and one of the handsomest actors in the business today .  he has the charm of a 30's movie idol and is able to put himself into silly situations with dignity .  ulysses has an ongoing obsession with his hair , risking life and limb to get a particular brand of pomade and a supply of hairnets .  his vanity will come to plague him as it would any mystical hero-wanderer .  while clooney is the name draw for "" o brother , "" the show stealer is tim blake nelson as delmar .  the heretofore unknown nelson is terrific as the simple convict who , at one point , hears the word of the lord and joins members of a church congregation in their mass baptism .  delmar is saved and dedicates his life to doing good and provides a richness to his simple character that makes him shine .  the taciturn pete , as played by longtime coen collaborator turturro , is the sullen member of the trio and gives them the necessary angst .  all together , the tuneful triumvirate is a mix of the three stooges and the three musketeers as they prove to be buffoons , albeit brave ones .  the colorful supporting cast is rampant with homerian characters to meet and get to know along the way of the boys' odyssey .  charles durning appears as incumbent governor pappy o'daniel , who keeps crossing paths with them in his bid for re-election .  john goodman is wicked as the one-eyed bible salesman and con artist , big dan teague .  michael badalucco is manic and outrageous as outlaw and bank robber extraordinary , george "" babyface "" nelson .  stephen root is amusing as the blind dj , rep'ing one of the many references to the sightless that abound in the film in mystical ways .  holly hunter is wasted in the small role as ulysses' estranged wife , penny ( and the real reason for this adventure , not secret treasure ) .  techs are , as expected in a coen brothers venture , first class .  cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked on five previous coen films , captures the sultry atmosphere of the south .  the photography complements the lush period production and costume provided by dennis gassner and mary zophres , respectively .  once again , roderick jaynes - the alter ego of ethan and joel coen - is on board as editor .  the high points outweigh the low through most of "" o brother , where art thou ? ""  with particular praise for the wonderful selection of period and traditional music .  i give it a b .

1|"contact ( pg ) there's a moment late in robert zemeckis's contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place .  we see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops .  anticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead .  it is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment .  jodie foster stars as dr . ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals .  and i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie's world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth .  after dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport .  from this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook .  the alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power .  the irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right .  it would be easy for scripters james v . hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane .  in the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults .  the complex role of ellie is an actress's dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge .  she conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge .  we root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far .  contact is clearly foster's vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles .  matthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film's weakest subplot ) .  john hurt is effectively creepy as s . r .  hadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding .  angela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine .  most memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances .  zemeckis comes off of his three-year break in top shape .  always known as a director of effects-laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact's visual effects are quite stunning .  the central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis's voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick's yet more wondrously pure .  and zemeckis doesn't resist the urge to use the always-interesting incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump .  effects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump .  it says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it's not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised .  the thought-provoking , two-hour-plus contact is a much-welcome change of pace from summer no-brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn't entertaining .  for all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it's being sold as-- "" a journey to the heart of the universe . ""  and what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is .  "|0.6|0.8666666666666667|0.9|"The movie ""Contact"" is described positively, with a focus on its sense of discovery, character development, brilliant performances, and thought-provoking nature.

1|"satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e .   "" dr .  strangelove "" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e .   "" men in black "" ) .  what's unique about "" wag the dog "" is that it doesn't necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time .  the result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit .  if there's anything that affects americans the most it's politics and showbusiness .  in this age of information and technology , we've been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it's gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it .  we need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking .  this film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn't someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ?  that's the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president's good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election .  brean , along with the president's top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) .  they pitch him an idea to "" produce "" the image of a war with albania ( it's a country no one's heard of so they people will buy it ) .  soon the wheels are in motion and the film's riffing satire comes into play .  we're inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) .  the initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news .  the characters' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque .  for example , one scene shows motss and brean's production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee .  motss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs .  since it's all computer-enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later .  this demonstrates the film's ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise .  but then there's the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress's name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , "" this is nothing ! ""  by the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens .  the first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film .  every ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it's always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it .  the screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners .  however , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject .  as the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture .  what had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie .  still , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt .  willie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted .  truly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and "" wag the dog "" at least succeeds in this respect .  however , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes .  then again , it's a valiant effort .

1|"after sixteen years francis ford copolla has again returned to his favorite project , making the third installment in the godfather-trilogy .  this new film has been underrated for no reason .  it is as intellectual and majestically made as copolla's pervious films .  it is also more psychological , pessimistic and more tragic than the first two .  the only regret is the unconvincing performance by the newcomer sofia copolla and some "" unfinished "" developments of some characters .  the film elegantly begins with nino rota's recognizable musical score , the beautiful skyscrapers of new york and michael's voice as he is writing a letter to his children : "" the only wealth in this world is children .  more than all money and power on earth , you are my treasure "" .  the year is 1979 and michael corleone has used the time since the ending of "" part ii "" to make his father's dream come true - making the corleone family legitimate .  michael sold all his casinos and invests only in gambling .  constantly haunted by the past , his only reason to live is his children .  the family has amassed unimaginable wealth , and as the film opens michael corleone ( al pacino ) is being invested with a great honor by the church .  later that day , at a reception , his daughter announces a corleone family gift to the church and the charities of sicily , "" a check in the amount of $100 million . ""  but the corleones are about to find , as others have throughout history , that you cannot buy forgiveness .  sure , you can do business with evil men inside the church , for all men are fallible and capable of sin .  but god does not take payoffs .  the plot of the movie , concocted by coppola and mario puzo in a screenplay inspired by headlines , brings the corleone family into the inner circles of corruption in the vatican .  there is a moment in "" godfather iii "" where michael says : "" all my life i have been trying to go up in society , where everything was legal .  but the higher i go , the crookier it becomes . .

1|there must be some unwritten rule that states , one gets enlightenment not in the way one expects to get enlightenment but in the commitment given to seeking wisdom , even if it is a foolish road one is on and it seems to be leading nowhere .  in the exotic morocco of 1972 , a 25-year-old english hippie mother , julia ( winslet ) , of two sweet young girls , the 6-year-old lucy ( carrie ) and the 8-year-old bea ( bella ) , has arrived for a year's stay , with the self-absorbed mother oblivious to how her daughters might be adjusting to this foreign experience while she is searching for a change of life from her unfaithful poet husband ( she is not officially married to him ) and her cold one-room london flat , and is sort of looking for the eternal truth in the sunny climate of marrakech .  at least she says she is , as she is making some attempt to contact a sufi sheikh there who has all the answers .  she has not planned things out too carefully , having no money , and the trip doesn't seem like it's much fun , more like a misadventure , with some romance with a local moroccan thrown in .  drugs , a world-wide youthful phenomena during this period , where many westerners came to morocco to smoke the good hashish found there and to live the 'good life' cheaply , and to be in a spot where they did not have to worry about being hassled by the local authorities , even though drugs are illegal there .  but this is not shown as one of her reasons for being here .  in this film , the subject of drugs is never broached , only hinted at in an off-handed but slurring way , as the hippie commune is shown in a negative light , strumming on their guitars and bragging about the hits of acid they have taken .  even the ones coming here for spiritual reasons , to follow the mystical sufis , seem lost following a culture that is far different from where they were coming from .  the film is based on the novel that contained the autobiographical experiences of sigmund freud's grand-daughter , esther freud , who traveled here in the 1960s with her mother and sister .  it is written by the director's brother , who has previously directed regeneration , the playboys , and trojan eddie .  the title of the film comes from the squealing giggles that saying hideous kinky gives the little girls .  with julia strapped for cash and not receiving a needed check her husband often forgets to send her , she is prevented from seeing the greatest living sufi who is located in algeria ; so instead , she meets an acrobat street performer in the bazaar , bilal ( said taghmaoui ) .  he becomes her lover , taking the place of her husband as a father figure for the girls .  the girls readily accept him , and there is no big-to-do made about their openly sexual relationship , but the girls really don't know what to make of the relationship .  it especially bothers bea , who is embarrassed by her mother's loose attitude and wants to go home .  things go surprisingly sour when bilal takes them to stay in his small village .  it seems only that bilal's charm is matched by his shiftlessness , as he has a wife who still lives there .  this scene didn't make too much sense as to why he would take them there knowing the situation , unless the uneducated man was totally uneducated in the customs of his people , also .  but i doubt that .  the family is now stuck without money in a backward area trying to decide what to do next , as they hitch a ride away from there with a truck driver who nearly kills them when he falls asleep by the wheel .  lucy takes it all in stride and has a good disposition for travel , while bea just wants to go to a school and learn something and be a 'normal' girl .  the beauty of marrakech is matched by the terrific performance of kate winslet , as the film accurately encapsulates the timeless city and its bustling street scenes , expansive views , illustrious mosques , and grand sunsets .  kate enacts the feel of what it was like to be a westerner , living out the countercultural experiences while awaiting to gather her sensibilities again and was fortunate enough to be able to go home the better off for her experiences , as many a drop-out reluctantly had to do after their stay ran out of money and purpose .  the background music from groups like america and jefferson airplane , provided further nostalgia for this easy to look at and easy to grasp film .  the only hope was that the two innocent girls would not be permanently harmed while on this sojourn , a venture that should be reserved only for those of college age or older who choose to go there for themselves .  the family's travel , which is on the edge , has julia waking up screaming from dreams that are bleakly haunting ; but , when she gets up , all there is , is this splendid emptiness all around her and a vacuous life that is starting to bother her .  that marrakech is disarmingly gorgeous and that london is old hat to her , is starting to wear thin in her thoughts .  it will dawn on her , when bea takes ill , as she reflects on what the sufi guru tells her , whom she finally meets and is driven to tears in his presence .  he is the guru who replaced the one she wanted to see but who died before she got a chance to see him .  the new guru is grounded in reality , something she is not grounded in , and seems to tell her what she couldn't comprehend from anyone else , even comforting her , by telling her that her tears are memories- a gift from god .  the film's weakness was the empty feeling i got from watching the story unfold in its risk free tenor ( she was there basically to be just escaping from her situation ) and how unappealing the love affair seemed between bilal and julia .  the storyline about a helpless single parent , detracted from the vibrant experiences many others of her same baby-boom generation had during their trip to morocco , who were taken in by the mystical culture of sufism , a teaching that has a lot to offer its followers , contrary to the impression the film might give , seemed to pass her by .  her knowledge of that trip is only surface deep , at best .  she perhaps would have been better off not taking the kids along , smoking some hashish , and have been less assured of herself but to have behaved more like a hippie and she wouldn't have been so uptight all the time and had some fun on her journey .  after all , the mystical trip is the journey .  the film's strength is in how all the characters are shown for what they are , and no one is that good or that bad , or judged too harshly for their shortcomings .  bilal is unreliable but is capable of generosity .  the little girls are precocious but they are lovable .  julia , the cornerstone the film is built on , is a mother who cares about the children but doesn't know how to take care of them without unintentionally harming them .  she was trying to escape from reality and that by returning to london , she has another chance to see if she can find the key to this world or whatever world she is looking for and should no longer have nightmares about where she's at .  this is a very freudian way to look at things , as this sudden realization , that things are not right puts an an end to her eastern hippie odyssey , at least , for the time being .  and , after all is said and done , who's to say if the children are also not better off for surviving their experiences , just like she probably was !  |-0.24966666666666668|0.75|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment of the text is mixed, as it discusses Julia's journey of self-discovery in Morocco, highlighting both the struggles and the hopeful tone.

1|did claus von bulow try to kill his wife sunny in their newport mansion ?  that is the question reversal of fortune asks you to consider as it opens in a hospital ward , with a comatose sunny von bulow .  she is the main narrator of the film , in a narrative trick that was extraordinarily risky for schroeder .  the dramatic trick works , as sunny von bulow narrates a compelling story of murder , sex , unhappiness , and a lawyer's moral dilemma as he takes a case he thinks he cannot win .  jeremy irons is claus von bulow , in what is his finest role , and one of the most devastingly evil performances in history .  he is as hated as any man alive , as cold as a cucumber .  his remorse for his wife's comatose condition is nonexistant , and it is no wonder that even his children have difficulty accepting his version of what happened during christmas , 1980 .  the background to the case is such .  during christmas of 1979 , sunny von bulow fell into a deep coma from which she recovered and awoke .  the same situation occured in 1980 , only sunny never woke , and probably never will .  when examined , it was found that she had 14 times the normal amount of insulin within her blood .  claus von bulow is then accused of attempted murder by his stepson , convicted , and freed on bail .  he immediately hires alan dershowitz , the renowed harvard law professor , to acquit him .  ron silver is magnificent as a moral lawyer who cannot stand what has happened to him .  we follow him through two very different cases ; the case of the johnson case , where two innocent kids are standing on death row for a crime they didn't commit , and von bulow , who he still hasn't figured out .  dershowitz doesn't know what happened to sunny , and he is extremely hesitant to take the case .  nevertheless , he does , based on certain things which happen during the investigative process that deeply upset him .  together with a group of law students , dershowitz concocts a defense and ultimately get the verdict reversed .  silver's performance is one of a handful of solid roles in this deep film .  schroeder directs on many different levels , with multiple plot lines which blend in wonderfully in the mind of alan dershowitz .  there are flaws ; at times , the film gets overly theatrical .  yet , due to glenn close's troubled and brutally honest performance as sunny von bulow , the use of her comatose body as a narrator works here fairly well .  the flashbacks are good , but at times schroeder doesn't fill in the blanks .  the movie could have benefited with the increased attention of certain developments during the film , and it could have used a better ending .  the film progressed wonderfully before ending suddenly , without any intelligent conclusion .  the supporting characters are often neglected , and dershowitz's team should have been allowed to grow character wise , but schroeder over-simplifies the story and the characters .  yet , for all these flaws , the film is deeply engrossing because of irons .  as von bulow , he is brutally evil .  anti-semitic , prejudiced , arrogant , protective , he is a rotten , lying monster , whose conviction may have been wrong legally , but morally he was to blame .  irons plays him to a cold perfection , with pathetic attempts to gain moral support for his claims to innocence .  he is an adulterous liar and a cheat who in all likelihood committed the murder .  however , the genius of reversal of fortune comes in its distinction between moral culpability and legal responsibility .  there is no doubt von bulow is responsible for his wife's death by years of neglect and coldness .  however , legally , did he do the murder ?  schroeder dares the viewer to make up his own mind .  with all the character flaws , reversal of fortune is an engrossing puzzle because it is intelligent ; he wants the viewer to make up his own mind .  schroeder taunts the viewer with contradictory revelations , and then mentions that the answer to this compelling puzzle shall be revealed when we join sunny von bulow , in death .  for all the failed dramatic theatrics , this is one that works beautifully .  we don't know what happened .  that sense of legal ambiguousness , along with von bulow's obvious moral guilt , is why reversalf fortune works .  in the end , von bulow is as sadistic as ever .  irons is haunting , and that is why reversal of fortune is so good .  |-0.05000000000000001|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|The text has a slightly negative sentiment, with mentions of murder, evil performances, immoral behavior, flaws in direction, neglected supporting characters, and a lack of satisfying ending.

1|"driving miss daisy takes its sweet time to tell a small , intimate story .  it's a quiet film , a slow film , a deliberate film .  but if you're patient with it , the movie offers innumerable rewards , such as a pair of self-assured performances by morgan freeman and jessica tandy .  driving miss daisy is based on alfred uhry's pulitzer-prize winning play of the same name , which first opened in new york four years ago .  the play has garnered international acclaim with productions in chicago , los angeles , london , vienna , norway , and the soviet union .  uhry himself wrote the screenplay for the film adaptation of driving miss daisy ; he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza .  the film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur .  the movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action .  in fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn't present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together .  rather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on .  the film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta's history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city's oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr .  the story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway .  the insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur .  freeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke .  the film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger .  driving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it's about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon .  daisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur .  initially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere .  once she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver .  to make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand .  eventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke's good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him .  tandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace .  we've seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon .  nevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own .  freeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances .  there is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color .  hoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior .  both freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma .  they flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves .  they bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie's gentle humor .  at the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama .  in his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy's loving and patient son .  drama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) .  the only other significant characters in the film are daisy's housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( "" good times "" ) , and boolie's pretentious wife , played by patti lupone .  under the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again .  but fortunately , beresford never forgets he's shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes .  in adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety .  uhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say .  beresford wisely exercises restraint in the film's dramatic moments .  the movie tugs at your heart , but it never goes for the jugular .  the only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees .

1|"when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better .  nice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s .  for new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids .  for people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for .  feelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era .  martin scorsese's taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all .  the movie's protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can't sleep at nights .  the job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world .  the only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine's presidential campaign .  their date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre .  losing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street .  he purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict .  that conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi .  as many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations .  for some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times .  for others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade .  brilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides .  his travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence .  his pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain .  however , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen .  but despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against "" scum "" is something that average person wants , but doesn't have a stomach/lack of brains to do it .  while de niro's travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel .  wizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america's better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he "" knows stuff "" .  his obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade .  other characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age .  matthew "" sport "" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture .  porno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly "" liberated "" betsy .  even the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless "" messages "" that cover the lack of any serious program can't fool even such idiots like travis .  the past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can't be washed away even by ironic happy end .  travis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader's screenplay into the silver screen .  new york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere .  another important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture .  one of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason .  instead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie .  now , more than two decades later , when some other "" life imitating art "" incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory .

"" what does it take to play carnegie hall ?  practice . ""  it takes two hours for music of the heart to "" play carnegie hall , "" both figuratively and literally .  like the children it portrays , the movie starts from the dark realms of awful cinema and works its way up to a show-stopping performance at the legendary concert hall .  roberta guaspari ( academy award winner meryl streep ) has two kids , a husband who left her and 50 violins she bought from a small shop in the mediterranean .  her life desperately needs a jump start and gets one when she meets a man who introduces her to a job as a music teacher at an east harlem elementary school .  she soon finds her job is on the rocks as the men in her life continue to rotate through revolving doors .  that is the pattern-like plot of this production .  ultimately , the film chooses a zero-sum answer to these problems and finds her music career at an all-time high when the men in her life finally vanish .  the first hour of music of the heart is rather painful .  roberta's character lacks development and consequently seems to be flat .  also lacking depth is the film's "" bad guy , "" a narrow-minded music teacher ( josh pais ) who rejects roberta out of principle ( the movie never explains exactly which principle that is ) and conveniently comes and goes from the plot according to when it might be dramatic to have a villain around .  the next 15 minutes of the film are mediocre .  they are highlighted by one child's return to roberta's class ( coming after the great old hollywood scene where he explains be can't be around anymore because "" my mom said . . . "" ) and a glowing concert .  not knowing the running time , you may expect the credits to role at this point .  but they don't .  instead the film uses the next 45 minutes to finish its journey from bad to mediocre to excellent .  director wes craven , known for his works of horror , uses some old sentimental tricks to get the audience tearing .  one romantic break up scene is highlighted by the classic "" but . . .  last night . . . ""  and roberta's two children also have textbook conflicts with their single mother regarding their father's absence .  the city of harlem plays a strong role in the movie .  roberta's mother is initially reluctant to see her daughter move to that part of town and the film does nothing to combat that stereotype .  the noise tracks for these scenes are dominated by sirens ; predictably one of roberta's students is gunned down and killed off screen .  one thing the film does lack is subtlety .  the fact that a little boy was playing "" we shall overcome "" on his violin after the aforementioned shooting was a cute and discreet reference .  the fact that the entire orchestra begins to play it over and over soon after is an overdone reference that shows how little credit he gives the audience .   ( of course , in horror films the foreshadowing and between-the-line moments are meant to be overdone , so perhaps he too is just learning to play the game . )  even with all its flaws , music of the heart is a beautiful film .  that is not an excuse for the movie's poor beginning .  but as i watched the scenes in carnegie hall , i thought of some of the great acts that have taken that stage .  in december of 1979 a comedian named andy kaufman put on a show that will forever be remembered as one of the most original in theatre history .  the performance included a dead-on elvis impression , robin williams in disguise and a moment at the end when kaufman announced he would take the whole audience out for milk and cookies .  so , how did this comic genius choose to open the show of his life ?  he had a character named tony clifton take the stage for the sole purpose of irritating and angering the audience .  perhaps it is okay for music of the heart to start off rusty because just as kaufman had santa's favorite food , this movie has an amazing finale .

1|seen april 16 , 1999 at 10 p . m . at crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #15 , by myself for free using my hoyts' critic's pass .  [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good seats , sound and picture]  do you realize that every time you encounter a new person you've just become part of a story ?  everyone has their own life story , both past and present , and every time two or more interact , they become part of each others' story ( not necessarily an important or even significant part , but a part nevertheless ) .  that seems to be the basic theory behind `go , ' where several characters' chance encounters all effect each other in extreme ways .  in order to test this theory screenwriter john august and director doug liman assemble a cast of characters that wouldn't usually be the types to have an entire film revolve around them , such as a teenage supermarket cashier , a bottom-of-the-drug-food-chain dealer and two struggling soap opera actors .  these types of characters might not sound all that original , but consider that they will all be somehow effected by a strip club bouncer and his psychotic father , a mid-level drug dealer , a narc obsessed with multi-level-marketing , horny wedding guests , a zen lovemaker , two shrimp-scarfers and a cute normal teenage girl to round things out .  how they will all come together is the process the film deals with .  i'd imagine the concept to the film started out as the creators' testing themselves to see if they could actually pull it off and the outcome is a terrific achievement in filmmaking and the craft of fiction in general .  the film starts out as anything else , with little indication of what's to come .  we meet ronna ( polley ) , a depressed los angeles checkout girl who doesn't seem to have much desire to do anything except work just to pay her rent .  she's not very charming , especially to her customers , but this is played mostly for laughs rather than characterization and it works .  maybe this is because she's not a very afeminite character , but she's far from masculine - a creative character indeed .  things start to progress when ronna reluctantly agrees to take the hours of the goofy , hyperactive , yet likable simon ( askew ) , an english teen into vices for the sake of the experiences .  this agreement starts a three-pronged storyline as it allows simon to go to las vegas for the weekend with his friends and in turn drags ronna and her friends into buying and selling an experimental drug .  the process of which will not only bring ronna close to being arrested but also to death .  nearly the same can be said for two other characters , zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) , who we don't think much of when they first appear as supporting characters , but later will become major players to the film's makeup - another process used by the filmmakers to elaborate on the theory of how significant insignificant interaction might be .  once the pace is picked up the film really begins to show its mettle .  when the title screen `ronna' is flashed shortly after the aforementioned turning point scene , it's clear this film isn't going to employ the standard linear method of storytelling .  considering how good it is up until that point , it's a long overdue change of pace needed in movies today .  and so the film begins to take shape , first by following ronna and her friends on a one-night adventure that begins with a drug deal instigated by zack and adam ( who were actually looking for simon ) , which doesn't exactly go as planned , but that's what keeps it all so interesting .  the second storyline starts at the same moment as ronna's story , but this time the camera chooses to follow simon instead .  simon and his three friends head to ? vegas for a night on the town and in the process experience things they never would have imagined .  the third arc , about zack and adam , again overlaps with ronna's story telling much of the same story but from a completely different angle .  we're shown things we never would have expected were going on while following ronna .  and many of the events that do happen to ronna because of zack and adam aren't even their fault - they just happened to be where they were when they were .  i'd really like to dissect each of the three storylines and especially how the film wraps up in the end , but that would take up too much time and space and spoil everything for those who haven't seen the film .  perhaps the greatest element to the film is its constant surprises and unpredictability , and not due to plot twists or a confusing screenplay , just through great filmmaking .  still , i can list and analyze nearly everything the film does so well :   ? direction : trying to piece together such a complex story is no easy task and for a rookie filmmaker such as liman , it's a great accomplishment .  he doesn't just depict a story , he wraps us up in it all , pulling us into the fray so that we experience every high and low .   ? screenplay : besides being chiseled with detail and creative in general , it's clear the script has been inspired by many sources , with both obvious and subtle references , yet it never screams `rip-off . '   ? tone/mood : where other hollywood films have failed to bring the charm of the independents to the mainstream , this one is able to create its own sense of the macabre .  it's not overly-dark or twisted and the comedy isn't so satirical for it to be considered a black comedy , more like `macabre light . '   ? cinematography/art direction : able to photograph both the intense and the lighthearted in the same manner .   ? characterization : for nearly every character introduced , no matter what role they play in the big picture , we're able to get a sense of who they are , what they're thinking and how they came to be in their situations .  even when their actions are surprising , it never seems very out of synch .   ? performances : every actor nails their role ( see above ) .   ? theme/theory : the film doesn't seem to be concerned with conveying any kind of political or social messages , instead , it's more of a philosophical experiment .  in fact , it might not have meant to do that intentionally , but there definitely is something existential to it all .   . . . and to think that `go' is just a big comedy and adventure !

'  i was perhaps wrong to be so harsh , but after his insidious flirtation with a street hooker , i just could not picture him in any romantic lead .  what makes this movie a wonderful experience is not the fact it stars hugh , but because it stars julia and carries with it a brilliantly written script .  this writer richard curtis , whose exceptional first work ? four weddings and funeral' shows us that he is a master in the domain of the romantic comedy , with splashes of drama thrown in between .  hugh and his hair , is almost identical to the character that made him famous in ? four weddings' .  he plays an ordinary guy who is down and out on his luck .  unfortunately , he is type cast in this role , but fortunately it works well for him in this movie .  if only he would dither a little less .  julia knows this role well .  the glamorous movie star who is searching for true love .  there are moments in this movie , that you almost weep for her pain felt loneliness .  how sad it must be to be so wealthy and beautiful , but to have no one to share it with .  the writer deals with difficult issues of love and social class on various levels .  how differences in social standing can make it almost impossible for love to grow in such a harsh environment .  how the media can be as cruel as it can be attentive , and how fulfilment in life and love can be found in forgiveness and sacrifice .  |0.15|0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|The sentiment of the text is a slightly positive overall, with some reservations about Hugh Grant's involvement.

1|"you'd think it would be easy to spoof star trek , but try spoofing it without cruelly mocking it .  that's a bit more difficult .  the farfetched sci-fi series is , after all , enormously popular , what with its gigantic fan base and ongoing installments both on television and in movies .  if you're not nice to it , you lose .  galaxy quest is to star trek what mel brooks's spaceballs was to star wars , an affectionate , riotously funny parody that freely takes jabs at various elements of its subject but never seems mean-spirited or malintentioned .   "" the show's been cancelled , but the journey is far from over . ""  that is the current tagline of "" galaxy quest , "" a star trek - type show that's no longer produced but lives on forever in reruns .  it also lives on in conventions , gatherings of the show's obsessive fans who never fail to dress in "" galaxy quest "" costumes and ask absurdly logical questions about its delirious technobabble .  jason nesmith ( tim allen ) played "" commander peter quincy taggart "" on the show and is the only one of the cast who still gets excited about the gigs they have to do .  the attitudes of the rest -- tommy webber ( daryl mitchell , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) , fred kwan ( tony shalhoub ) and alexander dane ( alan rickman ) -- range from indifference to utter contempt .  dane , who played a spock-like alien , is especially disgusted , considering himself above his demeaning job and stubbornly refusing to recite his character's cheesy trademark line "" by grabthar's hammer , you shall be avenged "" ( or something like that ) for his die-hard fans .  one day , nesmith is greeted by an especially fanatical group of "" galaxy quest "" followers .  they are actually aliens from a planet known as thermia .  they have mistaken the "" galaxy quest "" episodes for historical documentation of actual heroic space travel .  the next day , the thermians whisk nesmith away to a spaceship to help them defeat the evil sarris ( named , in one of the film's only mean-spirited gags , after village voice film critic andrew sarris ) .  nesmith thinks it is only an elaborate gig , and sort of blows it off , but when he is transported -- or i should say shot -- back to earth in a rather celestial manner , he believes .  next thing the cast knows , they are being dragged by nesmith to this spaceship .  of course , they all think he is out of his mind and once he does convince them that there really is a spaceship , what they want to do is get out of there as fast as the transporters will take them .  but after some persuading , they stay on to fight the icky sarris and find a way to provide a peaceful existance for the flailing thermians .  i was quite surprised how well this comedy , which came off as utterly brainless from its marketing campaign , worked .  taking shots at both the obvious and not-so-obvious elements of star trek and its fandom , galaxy quest never goes for cheap laughs , opting instead for broad but smart parody .  nothing is safe -- not the cliches , not the fans , not the absurd taglines -- but on the other hand , everything is safe , since galaxy quest treats its subject with utter respect and sometimes even subtle admiration .  the highlight of the movie is tony shalhoub's fred a . k . a . tech sergeant chen who , when in character , is the complete opposite of scotty from the original star trek .  while scotty , who was the technician for the enterprise would constantly yell "" i need more power down here captain ! "" ,  chen's cry for help is more to the tune of "" the core , like , won't take it or something . ""  it's a hoot , but it doesn't stop there : weaver , whose character has the menial task of repeating everything the computer says and rickman , with his relentlessly holier-than-thou attitude aren't far behind .  galaxy quest succeeds as a funny parody of star trek and while it's not a masterpiece -- it tends to falter in its more serious moments -- it is immensely entertaining fluff and excellent counterprogramming to all the sober oscar contenders being released this holiday season .  by grabthar's hammer , this is a hell of a movie .

1|"in my review of there's something about mary , i said something to the effect of "" laughter isn't everything . ""  i now need to make a brief addendum to my postulate : laughter isn't everything , unless i'm watching a jim abrahams film .  see , spoofs are easy with me .  i love movies , and i love movies that make fun of movies that i love .  sometimes i'm the only one in the theater laughing .  sometimes i laugh so hard that i embarass myself because my laugh is so high-pitched in comparison to my speaking voice ( it cuts right through everyone else's laughter ) .  sometimes i laugh so much that my cheekbones are sore by the end of the film .  abraham's latest film , mafia ! , induced this kind of hysteria upon me .  it's gotten some mediocre reviews , but , hey , i'm the guy who laughs at everything .  there may be a lot of jokes that flop in this film , but there are far more that work , and i laughed so frequently that the failed jokes usually occurred as i was recovering from the previous bout of giddy madness .  i enjoy films like this because not one second of it is serious or thought-provoking .  most lighweight films that pose as comedies try to do other things , like develop characters , shape stories , and other such nonsense .  mafia !  has no pretentions about characters or story , and it exists for no other reason than to make people laugh .  the film begins on the perfect high note , with a mockery of the opening of casino .  our hero ( jay mohr ) is seen walking from a casino and getting into his car , which subsequently explodes and sends him flying through the air against a backdrop of flowing fire .  to describe the story of mafia !  is absurd and pointless , but i will mention that it basically follows the framework of the godfather films , with a lot of casino references inserted throughout .  along the way , the parodies seem arbitrary , and rarely victimize mob films : pictures like the english patient , forrest gump , and jaws undergo severe and hilarious bashing .  movies like this rely on just a few things , but the most important element is direction .  abrahams has been down this path many times before ( hot shots ! , top secret ! , airplane ! , and any other film with an exclamation point in the title ) , and so i hold most of the success of mafia !  to his experience .  he takes just the right attitude in each scene , and manages to wring at least a bit laughter out of even the most oddly placed references ( one inexplicable moment seems like it wants to make fun of titanic , but it never develops ) .  the actors are all energetic , which helps a lot with the tone of the film .  mohr ( suicide kings , paulie ) , who is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors , is so good here .  he looks like he's having so much fun that he's containing his laughter in every scene ( watch his face in the sequence by the swimming pool ) .  he's probably the only performer in the cast who manages to urge laughter without the help of the material .  lloyd bridges does a decent imitation of brando's godfather , while pamela gidley is dead-on in a full-blown mockery of sharon stone .  the hard thing about writing reviews for comedies is that i'm supposed to give examples of things and be specific .  unfortunately , i was so constantly blindsided by laughter during mafia !  that i can't remember a lot of what made me laugh .  but that's a good sign : mafia !  is so funny that i wasn't even given time to apply any of the scenes to memory .  i laughed so hard that it shut off my brain .  i know that doesn't sound particularly complimentary , but when watching a dumb comedy like this , the first thing i want to do is shut off my brain .  finally , a film that does this for me .

1|"showgirls is the second major outing for the production team of pual verhoeven , director , and joe eszterhas , writer .  their last effort , basic instinct , played like the most sumptuous of classic hitchcock , with a dash of raw sex and sensuality that made it come across with a hit like curry-spiced tabasco sauce ; a dish not to everyone's taste , but certainly a well-crafted movie .  possibly that movie's greatest strength was that the most important events happened offstage , prior to the movie , during the movie , and after the movie . . .  and that , after bringing all the plotlines together neatly , it left the viewer with full knowledge of what * would * happen in the characters' future , so there was no need to film it .  there was actually about four hours' worth of screen story there , but eszterhas found ways to get it all on-screen in two , by leading his audience into analyzing what was really going on ; and by still holding their interest with clever misdirection and false trails .  the major elements that made basic instinct work so well are present in showgirls .  we have attractive , sympathetic , but still highly repellent characters ; we have shows for the eyes and the ears , plotlines that play on several levels , we have beautifully delineated characters who are drawn from life and very believable , and we have a story of an innocent ( who may not be so innocent ) who's trying to play straight , trying to improve her station in life , who slips into behaving the way those around her do . . .  but recovers with a flourish , and quits a winner .  in this sense , the movie is a bit of a departure for verhoeven , who's not known for treating his characters well ; but nomi , the part played by elizabeth berkley , definitely opts out of the game in a positive way , and we're left feeling good about her future .  this is not one of the great movies , but it's far better than we'd been led to expect by all the negative pre-release publicity .  verhoeven got his first oscar nomination in 1971 , and in the last quarter-century has pushed farther and farther , experimenting with the socially-acceptable limits to movie-making .  his most recent three movies , robocop , total recall , and basic instinct , have been a progression of back-door access to american culture , moving from the fantastic through the merely psychotic to the underlying basic drives ; and now he's exploring the sleeze .  this movie may be the first movie ever made for which the director's contract contained a specific provision that he would not have to deliver an r rated movie .   ( verhoeven had to cut several parts of basic instinct to get an r rating , although his original version is available on video . )  many reviewers have taken the politically-correct stance that any movie which uses naked ladies as scenery is a bad thing ; but they miss the fact that this movie is not about naked ladies , it's about people in an environment where naked ladies are common , and why such an environment should exist .  it's about the scum who use other people as power-trip toys , and the need to escape their power .  it's about a world where sex is nothing and normal human values don't pertain ; and the lack of sexual excitement and passionate heat in even the most blatant scenes is something of an accomplishment .  an nc-17 movie which isn't sexually exciting says a great deal about the phoniness and emptiness of a social stratum where sex has been robbed of any kind of beauty , power , or value .  the one scene in the movie that * could * have been a good sex scene , berkley and maclachlan in a swimming pool , is not exciting , because by then we already know his character is a callous manipulator .  if anything , it's a rape scene with a victim who's been duped into cooperation .  you don't make a movie about the history of black people in america without using a few black actors ; you don't make a movie about world war ii without a few guns going off and a few people getting killed ; and you don't make a movie about las vegas showgirls without showing a few las vegas showgirls . . .  and in an awful lot of vegas shows , an awful lot of ladies wear very little clothing .  this is a legitimate portrayal of a rather seamy side of the entertainment industry , in a town where sex is simply a negotiable commodity .  showgirls de-glamorizes the las vegas show and sex industries with great effectiveness .  nomi is played , in a very good performance , by elizabeth berkley , who gives us a solid picture of a woman with limited talents who's at the end of her rope , desperate to live a life better than the one she's known .  she has nothing to market except her body and her limited dancing ability , and is trying desperately not to to be a hooker , trying to be something better than she seems destined to be .  when nomi realizes she's gone too far for too little , she catches herself just in time to save the most essential part of who she wants to be .  gina rivera plays molly , a dressmaker and costumer who befriends nomi , providing her with what may be the one solid , positive relationship in nomi's entire life .  molly is the one who makes the difference , and provides the role model and framework nomi needs to verify the value system she'll be using for the rest of her life , and nomi's feelings for molly are the spur that forces nomi's decision .  gina gershon plays cristal , an aging , but still very attractive starring dancer , a reflexively competitive manipulator who's become a villainess by internalizing the ethos of the crooks and scum around her .  gershon plays cristal as a cross between ava gardner and raquel welch ; a fading talent made bitter by self-awareness .  her character is very well drawn and performed ; in a major scene in a hospital room , she acknowledges what she is , and , in essence , passes the torch to nomi .  the relationship between the two of them is the most honest one in the movie , and provides part of the impetus nomi needs to follow a different path .  it is no accident that the three important parts in this movie are women of different stripe ; molly is an honest , hard-working person who means well , and nearly dies because she confuses the glitter and the image with reality .  cristal is a talented dancer who's compromised her ideals and sold herself to be a co-operating part of the system , exchanging self-respect for the species of stardom that can be had in las vegas .  nomi believes she can make it without selling herself , succumbs to a degree , and then realizes she can make it without selling herself , and doesn't need las vegas or its brand of "" stardom . ""  the male parts in this movie are simply props ; they exist only to demonstrate and explicate the cultural milieu against which showgirls exist .  kyle maclachlan , whose single best previous work was as an inhumanly emotionless cop in the hidden , gives us a nicely reptilian bit of pond scum on two legs , camouflaged as a nice guy .  glenn plummer plays a dancer who's working as a bellboy , and provides a bit of alternate perspective .  plummer's character is the only one in the movie who's maintaining an interest in dance as a performing art , but even he's succumbed to the cult of manipulation .  plummer's character is the closest thing to a sympathetic male character in the whole movie .  some of jost vacano's cinematography is fantastic , and one particular delineation of nomi's character alteration , a no-dialog scene using nothing but color changes in the lighting , is utterly terrifying .  this movie is rated nc-17 due to language , sexual situations , full frontal nudity , violence , and probably the costuming as well .  i don't see a way this particular story could have been told well without it , and i regard it as a legitimate exercise in movie-making .  but don't go see it if you're not in a tough mood ; the only person it's possible to like in this movie ends up in an i . c . u .  on life support , and there is probably not one character in this movie you'd enjoy meeting in person .

1|"it has been three long years since quentin tarantino stunned the cinema world by claiming the cannes film festival's palme d'or , a $100 million-plus box office gross , and an oscar nomination ? all for his sophomore outing , pulp fiction .  since then , the talented film maker has been virtually invisible , surfacing briefly as a co-director of the wildly uneven four rooms and the screenwriter of the gory vampire-fest , from dusk till dawn .  in between , he has moonlighted as an "" actor "" with several decidedly unmemorable performances .  now , with much fanfare and anticipation , tarantino has returned with his third directorial effort , jackie brown .  and , while this motion picture , adapted from elmore leonard's novel , rum punch , offers solid entertainment , those expecting another bravura outing from tarantino will leave theaters disappointed .  for the most part , jackie brown is a pretty ordinary crime movie .  the story , which starts out slowly , develops into a twisty affair , with double-crosses and triple-crosses .  and the movie is littered with occasional tarantino trademarks : witty dialogue , unexpected gunfire , '70s pop tunes , and close-ups of womens' bare feet .  yet , for all of that , the production is something of a letdown .  the sheer , in-your-face exuberance that marked reservoir dogs and especially pulp fiction is absent .  the mostly-straightforward chronology of jackie brown doesn't match up favorably to the non-linear style of tarantino's previous efforts ? an approach that added tension and edginess to the narratives .  and there aren't nearly as many deliciously offbeat conversations this time around .  there's a samuel l . jackson monologue about guns , a jackson/chris tucker argument regarding the merits of hiding in a car trunk , and a jackson/robert de niro exchange that recalls some of the jackson/travolta material from pulp fiction , but that's about it .  jackie brown's lone "" innovation "" is its presentation of a crucial sequence from three different perspectives .  this isn't exactly an original technique ? it has been done numerous times before , most famously in akira kurosawa's rashomon and most recently in edward zwick's courage under fire .  however , while in those two movies ( and others ) , there was a legitimate plot reason for the multiple points-of- view , tarantino's sole purpose for using it appears to be because it's unconventional .  had the scenes in question been shown from only one of the three vantages , nothing would have been lost .  as a result , this aspect of the film is little more than a curiosity .  for the second picture in a row , tarantino is attempting to revive the career of a '70s icon .  this time around , instead of john travolta , it's blaxploitation queen pam grier ( foxy brown has become jackie brown ) .  in one of many nods to the most famous segment of grier's career , tarantino uses a '70s song to accompany her first appearance during the opening credits .  there are also several instances during jackie brown when the director offers a sly wink towards certain conventions of the blaxploitation genre ( although grier never does any butt-kicking ) .  grier is jackie brown , a flight attendant who gets caught transporting drugs and money into the united states .  she's working for gun dealer ordell robbie ( samuel l . jackson ) , but she keeps her mouth shut under questioning , despite pressure from ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , a federal official .  no longer sure whether or not he can trust jackie , ordell arranges for a bail bondsman , max cherry ( robert forster , tv's "" banyon "" ) to post the necessary $10 , 000 , then plans to shoot jackie if she proves disloyal .  jackie passes ordell's test , however , and soon the two of them are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 of ordell's money into the united states without tipping off the feds .  soon , just about everyone is after that money , including jackie , max , ray , ordell's perpetually oversexed and drugged-out girlfriend , melanie ( bridget fonda ) , and his right-hand man , louis ( robert de niro ) .  unsurprisingly , the most memorable performance is turned in by samuel l . jackson , but ordell isn't nearly as invigorating or compelling a character as jules from pulp fiction .  in addition to looking fantastic , pam grier is also quite good , although hers is not an oscar- caliber performance ( although she might get a nomination ) .  robert forster and michael keaton are solid in their tough-guys-who-rarely- smile roles .  bridget fonda is around for three discernible reasons : to look sexy in a bikini , to provide a little twisted comedy , and to satisfy tarantino's foot fetish .  robert de niro is criminally underused in a part that could have been played equally well by any grungy- looking , middle-aged actor .  the film , which clocks in at several minutes over the two-and-a- half hour mark , is probably too long for the material , but the plot is convoluted enough to keep us guessing throughout ( although the payoff is a letdown ) .  tarantino keeps things moving along nicely , with a heavier dose of humor and less violence than in pulp fiction , but , on the whole , this movie seems more like the work of one of his wannabes than something from the director himself .  when it comes to recent caper films ( like the grifters and bound ) , jackie brown is a second-tier effort .  it's an entertaining diversion , but not a masterpiece , and certainly not an oscar contender .

1|one of the biggest cliches of any serial killer film is also one of the most believable .  you know , the one where the detective looks at a wall of pictures and other police information , and suddenly spots the clue which reveals who the killer is .  sure , it's been used over and over , but for some reason , it is always fun to watch .  this cliche pretty much describes the level kiss the girls works on : overused , but always fun .  one of my personal rules about watching a film is not how original the film is , but how it goes around giving its story .  this rule applies highly to kiss the girls .  there is something psychologically stimulating in a well-crafted serial killer movie , and kiss the girls is certainly well made .  however , the whole film screams of unoriginality , and so it relies on the power of its actors and the technical detail to pull it through .  well , not only are the actors capable of pulling it through , but they add so much to the film that nearly every flaw is covered up .  unfortunately , one of the most revealing and rather insulting choices by the filmmakers ( one that seven , a film a lot like this one , knew not to make ) was to put the name of the killer in the opening credits .  that may give the actor credit for the role , but throughout the film , hidden in my mind , i was waiting for him to appear on screen , which spoiled the mystery .  however , credit must be given to the director for suspending this knowledge through most of the film .  plotwise , kiss the girls shows almost no originality .  we are introduced to detective alex cross ( morgan freeman ) , a forensic psychologist , and immediately we are given the cliched scene establishing him as the hero .  he gets a call about a woman who has shot her husband and is now threatening to kill herself .  obviously cross succeeds at getting the gun , but this scene is quickly forgotten during the next scene .  at his house , cross is told that his neice , naomi ( gina ravera ) , has been missing for four days .  this provides the motivation for cross to find the killer , but we are never given a chance to establish the relationship between the two , and as a result , we can't sympathize with detective cross .  however , what makes kiss the girls slightly original is the introduction of one of the abductees . . .  before she is abducted .  dr . kate mctiernan ( ashley judd , the actress of the judd family ) is a smart , athletic woman , and because of these traits , becomes a target for casanova--what the serial killer likes to call himself .  because of these character-developing scenes , we care for mctiernan , making the abduction scene all that more suspenseful .  after being abducted , mctiernan wakes up and finds herself in a cell somewhere in the woods .  remembering that the killer gave her certain rules , she decides to break one of them by calling out .  when casanova comes to punish her , she breaks out and escapes by jumping over a waterfall .  after she is found , she begins to help cross find his neice .  from this moment on , kiss the girls takes on the form of every other serial killer film , as the two leads search for the rest of the victims held captive .  many people will compare this film to 1995's seven , another killer film starring morgan freeman , but i presume that the similarities are intentional .  the screenplay , by david klass , is adapted from the novel written by james patterson , and yet i don't quite see how this story could have worked in novel form .  what makes kiss the girls so good is the acting and the technical and visual impressiveness .  the cinematography , by aaron schneider , is reminiscient of seven , and sometimes i felt that many of the shots were trying too hard to impress us .  sometimes a simple shot is the best one .  however , many of the shots are stunning , and unlike seven , most of them take place during the day , in sunlight .  the scene when ashley judd is running through the forest is extremely well done , in more than one way .  the camera work is terrific , but the editing makes this scene work so well .  the chaotic and mtv-type cutting gives the audience a sense of confusion and unawareness , exactly what judd's character is experiencing .  however , the best aspect of kiss the girls is its actors .  morgan freeman is one of today's most powerful and believable actors .  detective cross is a very good character for him , although it is just a similar one to the character in seven .  because of freeman's powerful presence , he carries half the film by himself .  the other half is carried by ashley judd , one of today's most promising dramatic actresses .  in fact , her performance is better than freeman's , if that is even possible .  her character is more original than freeman's , and she handles it wonderfully .  we finally have a female character in a movie like this who does more than just scream .  the supporting cast is highly underdeveloped , but the cast members do as much as they can with it .  cary elwes portrays a cop in north carolina , and unfortunately has scraps for a character .  tony goldwyn fairs slightly better , but we don't really get to know his character either .  gina ravera gives a good performance , but again she isn't in many of the scenes .  so as a result of all these small supporting parts , the weight of the film lies on the two leads , and they do a phenomenal job .  some of the best acting of this genre , and some of the best acting of the year .  two other essential aspects of the film are quite good .  director gary fleder does a good job of controlling his actors , but the second half of the film loses believability , especially during the revelation of the killer .  he also doesn't handle the suspenseful scenes as a better director would have , losing a lot of tension during many scenes .  however , to his credit , he does manage a terrific first half .  part of the blame falls on david klass .  i'm sure the book developed many of the lesser characters more , but klass focuses on the two main parts .  while this may give the two leads more screentime , many of the small characters are one-dimensional , and the killer , when revealed , is extremely implausible .  thanks to the smart dialogue adapted from the novel , kiss the girls always seems intelligent .  none of the conversations are laughable , and all move the plot forward without seeming forced .  one of the biggest problems i had with the movie was the motive of the killer .  i blame this mainly on the casting director , because the killer's motive is because of rejection from women ( or so i assume from the opening monologue ) , but the killer himself is very attractive ( one of my friends is a , shall we say , big admirer of the killer ) .  kiss the girls is rated r for terror , violence , language , and suggested sex .  with all the implausibilities of this film , and with the mediocre second half , kiss the girls somehow manages to thoroughly entertain .  in fact , i had the urge to see it again just for the performances .  the cinematography adds a lot of mood to the already creepy tone , and the script is usually smart .  this is clearly one of those movies which rely on the acting to pull it through .  morgan freeman is possibly today's most convincing actor , and ashley judd adds another notch on her acting belt .  i must also say that i loved the ending .  the showdown between good and evil was quite tense , and the resolution of the scene makes almost anyone cheer .  perhaps it may not be possible , but most of the film isn't anyway .  |-0.2333333333333333|0.7666666666666666|0.8000000000000002|The explanations suggest that the

1|"i was originally going to give the spanish prisoner two and half stars .  from my first viewing , i noticed that david mamet's film was intense and clever at times but boring and cliched at other times especially at the beginning .  from my second viewing however , i noticed that mamet's script was actually a masterpiece .  the spanish prisoner , like the usual suspects or chinatown , begs for the viewer's complete attention .  miss a scene or even a small detail , and you could miss the meaning of the entire film .  also like the aforementioned films , it rewards its viewer for paying attention by delivering a surprising and memorable ending .  mamet is success doing again what he once tackled in 1987 when he wrote and directed house of games .  like his past gem , the spanish prisoner fools the audience as much ( or even more ) than the victim .  because we were deceived just like the victim , we feel a strong attachment to the main character and consequently are more interested in the film .  mamet has the talent of not completely ending a film gift wrapped , but rather leaving some ambiguity towards the end .  the power that he has in forcing the viewer to determine who the good guys and bad guys are once the film is over , without giving a right answer , is unique and ingenious .  the spanish prisoner will leave you seriously puzzled and intrigued .  after seeing the film again , i noticed that the details mamet uses are so incredibly accurate it is frightening .  his direction is very subtle ; as he leaves so many clues explaining what is going on and who is who but it is still very difficult to tell what exactly is happening even if you see all of them , or think you see all of them .  the story follows a young up and coming businessman , joe ross , ( campbell scott ) who has just created a mysterious and lucrative "" process "" that everyone is trying to get their hands on .  soon ross does not know who he can trust or who is after his "" process .

1|an unhappy italian housewife , a lonely waiter , a goofy masseuse , lots of love , and gorgeous scenery all come together in bread and tulips , which proves charming despite its covering of predictable , well-worn material .  the story concerns the aforementioned housewife , rosalba barletta ( licia maglietta ) who accidentally becomes separated from her immediate family while on vacation .  instead of waiting for a ride home , rosalba opts not to go home to her italian town , but to instead hitchhike to venice .  upon arriving , she tells her self-centered husband , mimmo ( an excellent antonio catania ) that she'll be home in a few days .  of course , that doesn't happen , as rosalba quickly gains a level of independence that has been unattainable in her past life of scrubbing floors and buying groceries .  in what seems like days , she moves in with lonely , suicidal waiter fernando ( bruno ganz ) , gets a job as a florist , learns the accordion , and befriends her neighbor -- a wacky holistic masseuse named grazia ( marina massironi ) .  rosalba , who is first seen wearing a gaudy stretch pants outfit , starts wearing sexy dresses and getting closer to fernando .  i can think of at least five other ( american ) movies ( including fried green tomatoes and an unmarried woman ) that are more than similar to bread and tulips .  but maglietta and ganz , who act with restraint and care , help bread and tulips from becoming a tired retread .  ganz plays the suicidal waiter role with a solemn , sometimes playful dignity that is a joy to watch , while maglietta never overreacts to her growing comfort with the outside world .  throughout the movie , maglietta has an easygoing , confident demeanor , which makes it very easy to root for her and her growing attraction for ganz's character .  the gorgeous scenery of moonlit town squares and sparkling rivers provides a perfect love story backdrop -- you just might want to ask the attractive stranger in the seat behind you for coffee after the lights come up .  director and co-writer silvio soldini must get credit for sprinkling the movie with effective goofy humor .  the cheap mimmo , desperate to find his wife ( after all , he needs his shirts ironed and his mistress won't do it ) , hires a job applicant ( giuseppe battiston ) at his bathroom supply firm to do the job .  the reason ?  mimmo discovers that the prospective plumber loves detective stories .  the novice detective's various misfortunes , including him saying goodbye to his weepy mother , are very funny .  unfortunately , there are flaws that somewhat spoil bread and tulips' cheery tone .  rosalba is bothered by several surreal dreams during her time in venice , which bring the movie to a halt .  it's like putting a gunfight in a nora ephron movie .  several details in fernando's life also never get proper closure , including his suicidal tendencies .  early in the movie , he nearly hangs himself before rosalba knocks on his apartment door .  after that , fernando's step towards death is never made reference to , probably because soldini wanted to include a lukewarm , underdeveloped subplot about fernando's stormy past .  it seems more like a desperate attempt to pump up the drama in a plot that doesn't need any .  but there aren't a lot of overwhelming negatives in bread and tulips .  the movie is fun and romantic , with beautiful scenery and characters whose lives we'd like to live if we had the nerve . . .  or if our passports weren't missing .  |0.27366666666666667|0.85|0.8333333333333334|"The sentiment in the text is slightly negative to moderately positive as the movie ""Bread and Tulips"" is described as charming with praise for the acting and scenery, but with flaws in the plot and unresolved storylines."
1|after the terminally bleak reservoir dogs and the brutally violent pulp fiction , jackie brown seems like something of a light-hearted departure for quentin tarantino .  it's more of a ho-hum heist story with characters that speak the tarantino language .  luckily , his showcase of actors convert every morsel of possible enjoyment onto the screen , and jackie brown has no trouble entertaining the average viewer .  the story introduces us to a street-wise black woman named jackie brown ( pam grier ) , a flight attendant who smuggles money and drugs from one destination to another .  she works for a bottom-of-the-barrel airline and receives a minimal salary .  but one day , she is picked up by a pair of federal officials ( including michael keaton as the tough-nosed ray nicolet ) , and found with a handsome load of cash and a small bag of smuggled dope .  jackie is working for a weapons dealer named ordell ( samuel l . jackson ) , who pays her bail money but suspects her of tipping off the feds about their operation .  soon jackie and ordell are plotting a way to smuggle $500 , 000 through to them under nicolet's nose , with the help of ordell's oaf of a partner ( robert de niro ) and drugged-out lady friend ( bridget fonda ) .  also entering the picture is a bail-bondsman named max cherry ( robert forster ) , who takes a liking to jackie and agrees at one point to make the situation even more complicated ( how i won't say ) .  the big drop-off is undoubtedly the high point of jackie brown , in which numerous double-crosses take place and many clothing store bags ( filled with cash ) switch hands .  it's unfortunate that tarantino takes his sweet time getting there , and doesn't offer anything extremely compelling while doing so .  there are , as always , amusing exchanges between characters .  the funniest repartee is between de niro and fonda , as he becomes annoyed with her constant bickering while making fun of his iq , or lack thereof .  the most interesting relationship is between max and jackie .  a 56-year old white bail bondsman and a 44-year old black flight attendant with believable chemistry ?  you've got to commend the acting .  jackie brown is a seriously dragged-out exercise enlivened by such fine acting .  the film clocks in at a lengthy 2 hours , 35 minutes .  tarantino's talky style manages to hold your attention heavily , but there are more than a few dramatic lapses and crucial lulls in the storyline .  also , fans of the director should be prepared for a lighter side to appear .  jackie brown has four major shootings , and two of those take place mostly off-screen , so don't be expecting a typical tarantino bloodbath .  you can expect frequent foul language , mostly coming way of ordell , who ( much to the dismay of spike lee ) uses the `n' word as part of his regular vocabulary .  the acting is the glue that holds everything together .  grier , making a sudden comeback from her reign in the 1970's , is more than adequate for the title character .  in fact , she's flat-out great .  another comeback comes from former tv star robert forster , who does a grand job as max cherry , and is perfectly cast in doing so .  michael keaton makes his presence felt , albeit in small but dignified moments , and de niro is ideal in playing the lug-head who goes over the edge .  speaking of that , bridget fonda has relatively little to do as ordell's bikini-clad beach babe , and yet she manages to look fairly occupied .  there's not a single sign of misplaced dialogue or snubbed line throughout the entire movie .  which is a life-saver for mr . tarantino .  the story barely holds together in the meantime , and we merely get a small tremor whenever there should be a defeaning earthquake .  but oh well .  jackie brown manages to be an enjoyable detour from quentin tarantino , even if it is lacking the glaring and original bite of his previous work .  let's just hope that the director hasn't gone soft on us .  |0.11666666666666665|0.8666666666666667|0.7333333333333334|"The movie ""Jackie Brown"" receives mixed sentiments, with positive aspects including the showcase of actors and the chemistry between characters, but criticism on the pacing and lack of compelling elements.

1|upon taking a seat at the theater , and surveying the crowd , i soon realized that i was the only person under forty in the premises .  i'm twenty-two , but have been accused of looking sixteen .  yet as the film began , any consciousness of setting shifted to the home of five close-knit , yet troubled sisters .  director pat o'connor ( inventing the abbots , circle of friends ) weaves a quiet yet affecting tale of loss , need , and the bonds between five sisters .  the family is ruled by kate ( meryl streep ) , an unconsciously strict schoolteacher , who is completely conscious of the deterioration of her family .  there is very little background given to the viewer , as we are thrust into a tense but loving home .  squabbles take place one after the other , caused by years and years of history .  perhaps one of the best things about this film , is its naturalness .  no situation is over-wrought , and characters react as real people do , to real problems .  this probably is a result of the film being from a stage play .  the play was in turn is based on a time in the life of the playwright .  what seems to be an underlying theme are the pagan rituals and dances of peoples , both in lughnasa and africa .  in fact , dance seems to be the glue that holds the family together and most expressively shows their closeness .  legs tap , and bodies sway even in the midst of impending disaster .  only after the music stops , and the characters stand breathing heavily do we sense any trouble .  in the quiet after the music we muse that it's sad that music has to cease , and families falter .  the movie is framed by a scene of michael mundy , the narrator of the movie , as a young child flying a kite .  he trips over a bump and loses hold of his string , and the kite floats off farther into the distance .  drawn on the white diamond of the kite is a face that looks at once pained , and at another glance mischievous .  the mundy family itself follows a similar fate to that of the kite , and kate's hold of the family isn't strong enough to hold off the winds of change .  as michael stands , staring at his kite fly away , we hear the adult michael , looking back at the season that his world changed forever .  the movie is not overpowering , but it gives us a beautiful window into the life , love , and trouble of a household of lonely women .  note : this is the first movie review i've ever written , any responses on it would be greatly appreciated .   : )  |0.26666666666666666|0.8000000000000002|0.8000000000000002|The sentiment of the text is slightly positive as the author appreciates the naturalness of the film, portrayal of bonds between the sisters, and closeness through dance.

1|in may of 1977 , just 2 years after steven spielberg's success with jaws and 3 years after francis coppolas' the godfather , a risky , ambitious young director named george lucas went for the same unpredictable box office success .  little did he know that star wars would become the greatest science fiction epic in the history of film .  in january of this year , lucas re-released star wars on its 20th anniversary .  in this new , remastered version , the added effects , which range from leathery desert beasts inserted into already existing shots to an awkward new scene in which hans solo bargains his way out of a jam with a computer-generated jabba the hutt , don't do much but call attention to themselves .  other than these , the film is exactly the same .  why pay to see it in the theaters , you might ask ?  simply because when this movie was released , most of us were a few years short of being born .  we should all get up and go to the movies for the experience , especially if you haven't seen it .  the plot is basic but in the same way , complex .  it has many themes , but the one rotates around luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) and his quest to become a jedi knight .  his mission begins when a droid named r2-d2 plays back a secret message recorded by the beautiful princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , which tells him to contact the mysterious obi-wan kanoby ( alec guiness ) .  he and kanoby then , joined by two inter-galactic renegades , hans solo ( harrison ford ) and chewbacca , and skywalker's two droids d2 and c3po ( the voice of anthony edwards ) , wage war upon the corrupt empire , commanded by an evil general ( peter cushing ) and the traitorous darth vader ( the voice of james earl jones ) .  skywalker defeats the evil empire by rising out of himself to embrace something larger : the force .  the film is obviously quite star-studded .  but how was lucas to know that ford would become one of the most sought after men in hollywood and jones' voice would appear so many more times in the future ?  it just happened to work out for him .  the magic of star wars lies in the way that skywalker's triumph is symbolized by the audience's sense of becoming something larger than life itself-a universe of fans , young and old , recreating a movie atmosphere that will impress generations forever .   ,  |0.3833333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly positive, emphasizing the impact and success of Star Wars.
