1|"three things i learned from "" being john malkovich "" : when getting on the elevator for your first day of work on the 7 1/2th floor of a building , always bring your crowbar ; don't stand in the way of your wife's actualization as a man ; and , whenever entering a portal into the mind of another human being , wear old clothes , because , hey , it's muddy in there .   "" being john malkovich "" is the most original film to come down the pike in a very long time .  wildly surrealistic , yet presented in a down-to-earth , funky style , this is the kind of movie that sticks in your head .  after savoring the sheer inventiveness of the storyline , you roll around the wealth of ideas contained within it .  from the ethics of relationships and politics of immortality to the very nature of identity itself , there's a lot to think about here .  just don't forget to have fun .  clearly , all parties involved in the making of the film certainly did , starting with writer charles kaufman .   "" i wrote 'being john malkovich' without an outline , "" he explains in the press notes , "" blindly , with no sense of direction or purpose .  it's important to me that i don't have a map before i start .  this allows me to surprise myself , stay engaged , discover things , and , hopefully , allow the unconscious to surface . ""  spike jonze ( mark wahlberg's na ? ve buddy in "" three kings "" ) takes it from there .  the white-hot director of the beastie boy's "" sabotage , "" an award-winning parody of '70s tv cop shows , as well as numerous other music videos and commercials , eschews typical mtv flash for his feature film debut .  jonze wisely realized that a storyline this unusual is most effectively presented in a low-key style .  his flat , matter-of-fact approach works perfectly .  and then there's the cast .  john cusack plays control freak craig schwartz , a street performer who periodically gets decked by parents objecting to his remarkably expressive , but decidedly erotic puppet shows .  over the years , his marriage to obsessive pet store employee lotte ( cameron diaz ) has devolved .  once passionate lovers , the two are now little more than courteous roommates .  financially strapped , craig takes a job as an entry-level file clerk at lestercorp , located on the 7 1/2th floor of a manhattan building .  navigating around dr . lester ( orson bean ) , his 105 year-old boss and floris ( mary kay place ) , lester's dotty secretary , craig tries to settle into his new position , but two things keep him distracted .  first , there's the beautiful and imperious maxine ( catherine keener ) , who delights in tormenting craig over his obvious lust for her .  and then there's the hole behind the file cabinet , which turns out to be a portal into the mind of actor john malkovich .  craig learns that anyone who enters the portal gets whooshed into the subconscious of malkovich , where they can experience life from his point of view ( with enough concentration , you can even influence his actions ) .  after 15 minutes , the visitor gets ejected and unceremoniously dumped in a ditch on the side of the new jersey turnpike .  then things get a little weird .  by the way , if you're concerned that i gave away too much of the plot , rest assured - - i barely scratched the surface .  one of the most satisfying aspects of the fable is that kaufman is not content to simply milk laughs from his bizarre set-up .  instead , he crawls into the dark premise as completely as craig crawls into malkovich , rummaging around and toying with the various philosophical implications of compromising another person's identity .  he also examines the consequences of the malko-visits to craig , lotte , maxine and , of course , john malkovich himself .  the performances are superb .  malkovich ( best known to mainstream audiences for his work in "" dangerous liaisons , "" "" in the line of fire , "" and as head psychopath in the guilty-pleasure "" con air "" ) tweaks his own image in a dandy self-deprecating turn .  far from his effete , vaguely reptilian persona , this malkovich is just another schlub , drinking with his pals and trying to get laid ( incidentally , charlie sheen also plays himself in a hilarious parody of his well-earned bad boy reputation ) .  as always , john cusack nails his part , handily pulling viewers along even as craig's actions become unconscionable .  the big surprises come from catherine keener and cameron diaz , both playing against type .  kenner , usually cast in icy subordinate roles , is terrific as a highly intelligent , extremely manipulative femme fatale .  cameron diaz , barely recognizable under a mess of brown , curly hair , sheds her perpetually sunny smile and draws big laughs as a woman thrown into extreme sexual confusion after taking a ride in malkovich .   "" being john malkovich "" stumbles towards the end , as jonze and kaufman try too hard to resolve the various subplots .  additional characters and increasingly complex explanations lead to a cluttered finale .  regardless , this contemporary "" alice in wonderland "" is a real treat .  i enjoyed watching "" being john malkovich , "" but only later , after reflecting on the film , did its resonance fully hit me .  at one point , craig says , "" do you know what a metaphysical can of worms this portal is ? ""  truer words were never spoken .

1|"in my reviews i try to make gentle recommendations rather than telling you what to see or what not to see .  i realize that we all have different tastes and i cannot predict what my audience will like and what they will dislike .  but in the case of american beauty , i must make an exception .  if you haven't yet seen it , go see it .  now .  stop reading this review and head for your local multiplex , then after you've seen it , come back .  i'll wait here .  welcome back .  if you followed my advice ( and i see no reason why you should not have , do you ? ) ,  i'm sure you've just had one of the richest cinematic experiences of your life .  american beauty is an extraordinary film , a powerful , jolting exploration of the dark side of the american dream .  it's humorous but it isn't funny because of the unrelenting ominous undercurrent that runs throughout the whole production .  mixing comedy and the darkest of drama was the way this film was intended , and by god , it works , making it one of the year's very best .  lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) has entered the mother of all mid-life crises .  he is living life without a purpose .  he is bored , depressed and sick of his sheltered , insignificant existence .  he barely ever talks to his family , has no sex life , is stuck at a dead-end job and thinks he has no reason to live .  but one day , when he and his equally troubled wife ( annette bening ) attend one of his daughter's ( thora birch ) cheerleading performances , he sees something that makes him come alive .  what he sees is the performance by his daughter's friend , the head cheerleader .  he develops a lust for the promiscuous young girl ; an obsession which soon becomes pedophilic in nature .  but for the first time , lester feels that he is actually living .  this crush is only the beginning .  lester proceeds to make more and more radical changes in his life , buying the car of his dreams , cursing off the boss and quitting his job ( "" today i quit my job , told the boss to f * * * himself and blackmailed him for $60 , 000 -- would you pass the asparagus please ? "" ) ,  buying drugs from the voyeur-next-door ( ricky fitts , a teenager who mysteriously videotapes what he considers to be "" beauty "" ) and refusing to be docile in family affairs .  his new attitude further alienates his daughter , only reassuring her that her parents are nothing more than freaks of nature unjustly forced on her by the powers that be , and inspiring her to enter a relationship with her eccentric neighbor .  and the burnhams's neighbors provide american beauty with a significant chunk of its dramatic momentum .  ricky fitts ( wes bentley ) serves as the film's thematic center , providing the obscure , powerful meaning of the title .  colonel fitts , the father , is one of the most fascinating and complex characters in the movie , even considering his limited screentime .  kevin spacey has never been better , and this performance will certainly earn him a chance to put a little gold person on his mantel .  he never plays his droll character as a freak , rather , he effectively portrays him as a normal person led to drastic self-exploration by his dissatisfaction with life .  spacey is poignant and devastating in the role of a lifetime .  equally astonishing is young thora birch , who plays her potentially stereotypical rebellious teen character with suprising feeling and tenderness .  at two hours and ten minutes , american beauty didn't feel nearly long enough .  it's a complicated , unforgettable film that , like the ice storm two years ago , dares to explore the darkest reaches of suburban life .  powerfully and cynically , it dissects the notion of the pretty house with the white picket fence and appealing garden being the american dream .  it claims that this picture-perfect image is just that -- an image , and hiding behind it are lives much darker than common knowledge would have it .  the dark , deeply ironic ending , though given away by our narrator in the first few minutes of the movie , stays with you for weeks after it's all over .  american beauty is just the kind of uncompromising film hollywood needs every now and then to counterbalance the mindless drivel we see released ; even more so considering it's a masterpiece .

1|"'pleasantville' ( 1998 ) taps into hollywood's lack of integrity with subtle messages that can be easily missed   ( www . pleasantville . com ) april 2 , 1999 ( friday )  cast : tobey maguire , reese witherspoon , william h . macy , joan allen , j . t .  walsh , jeff daniels  mpaa rating : pg-13 for sexual content and thematic elements  genre : drama  in my opinion :  in short : it takes a lot of careful observation to see the true morals and lessons brought out in this film ; one can easily be misled as to what the real message is .  review : in a literally colorless world with an almost mechanical population , there is no room for transitioning variety or even the customary happenings of everyday life , such as rain , fire , or emotions .  the town of pleasantville has one adjective : pleasant .  there is no sadness , no fear , no danger , no discomfort , no love , and no hate .  put simply , it's a place alanis morissette could really work wonders for .  j one big note however is that it is only a 50's sitcom that airs in reruns on an "" oldies "" tv station ? or is it ?  i had waited months to see this movie and after doing so on opening day i was not disappointed .  i found it quite intriguing and delightful and went back 3 more times in the period it endured at the box office .  but it wasn't until months later , when i slipped in for a small showing in one of those crummy "" dollar theaters "" after not having seen it for so long , that my eyes were opened to such a deeper meaning and perspective than i had previously experienced .  it is a far too feasible misconception that this is a film which forwards the idea that a world without some "" healthy "" immorality is not a world at all .  instead , the actual message , which so far has not been recognized by many viewers that i know of , is that a world without immorality doesn't give one the ability to discern right and wrong for himself , because everything is automatically right .  there is no room for mistakes and growth and learning because there are no mistakes to be made , no space for growth , and never anything new to learn , and that is the key component to the entire purpose of the story .  now i'm not saying that's necessarily the way it was intended to be interpreted , but that is hands down the proper way in which it should be .  besides a hidden symbolic depth and themes that go beyond what we can absorb from previews , this film has elements of physical wonder and strength that make it just so great to watch .  the visual effects are indeed striking and what little color is revealed is impartially favorable .  after spending the bulk of the movie staring at black and white , it's hard not to identify and appreciate the fact that our own world allows for all that brilliance and more .  a truly intelligent addition to it all , however , is the charming and ardently attainable cast that operates together like clockwork .  that said , the plot goes as such .  david and jennifer are two very 90's high school twins with the typical "" relationship "" outline of don't-mess-with-my-life-and-i-won't-mess-with-yours .  they demonstrate the well-known teenage qualities of two of the common versions of adolescents today .  david is the shyer , subtler twin who would rather watch tv land than mtv , while jennifer is the wild , licentious one who spends her days at the mall and relishes in the pleasures of the offensive world of degradation .  but when a freak accident enchantingly plops them smack dab in the middle of pleasantville as two of the main characters , they are forced to depend on each other to make it back home .  nevertheless , jennifer works her magic and introduces the town to a more unrestrained approach to life , and while david frantically tries to stop her and get them back home , he realizes that change was exactly what the town needed .  and , as said earlier , not to flip the town around into some corrupt society , but rather to give people the choice to decide between good and bad and to reap the results of their decisions and learn from them .  not only were difficult choices being brought upon the town , but the simple accepted occurrences of ordinary existence also began to take place .  people got hurt .  they cried .  they became afraid and happy and thoughtful and started to think for themselves , and that's when their physical world turned colors as well .  this can be looked upon as quite a controversial movie , but to me the message is finally clear .  i hope after reading this people can be more open to the film than they had been in the past , and realize that without choosing how our own lives will be run , we'll never know what we could have done better .  until the next great movie i see , i remain sincerely , danielle flynn , imr  "|0.35000000000000003|0.8000000000000002|0.7666666666666666|The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly positive.

1|"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  east meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney's parade of annual animated feature films .  an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential .  though not for lack of trying .  in many respects , mulan is among disney's most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat .  the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child's discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ?  in an instant , idealistic mulan's innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending .  the film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family's obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) .  dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney's new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film's vocal work , there's liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence .  while the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can't imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it's rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory .  the film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it's startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan's land .  at its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage .  as such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity .  scenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan's venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation .  mulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine's character-defining opening half-hour .  it's when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry .  off to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little "" lucky "" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief .  they're affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity .  at training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang .  everybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film .  the romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story's neo-feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation .  another staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness .  composed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- "" i'll make a man out of you "" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable .  only "" reflections "" , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre's most wondrously pure voices .  nonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer-generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive .  while the blatantly child-friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they're not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable .  briskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter .

1|"capsule : bleak and point-blank -- just the way it should be .  makes its case with cold-blooded precision and intelligence .   "" serial killer chic "" is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary , and one of the more stomach-turning ones .  i've never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers , and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry .  i wasn't sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/antihero .  thankfully , that's not the way henry works .  the director , john mcnaughton , took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work .  it doesn't provide cheap-jack explanations for henry's behavior : it shows him up for what he is , an unrepentant and un-idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him .  at the film's opening , henry's friend ottis toole has a sister , who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago .  in a viciously riveting scene , he admits matter-of-factly to having murdered his own mother , and she covers his hand with hers .  they are damned together from that moment on .  henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun .  the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it : there's a scene where the two go to buy a new tv .  the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words , and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron .  no preface -- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker .  in a scene which many damned the movie for , unseen , they steal a video camera and film the murder of a whole household , playing it back over and over again for their own enjoyment .  the movie itself , however , does not glorify the killings , but shows instead that henry feels no joy at his work , only irritation .  henry succeeds thanks to excellent writing and direction as well as acting .  michael rooker is credible as henry from the first frame , just standing there , and the rest of the cast works by being unaffected and casual as well .  the producers had originally comissioned a slasher film from mcnaughton , but he decided to give them something more memorable , and consequently the film nearly didn't see release .  the film does not glorify or justify -- it just shows us , with unflinching coldness , what henry was .  i'm hard pressed to see how anyone can see this and consider henry any kind of "" victim "" or "" hero "" .  then again , probably , so would henry .

1|"melvin van peebles' "" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song "" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement .  it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident .  its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before .  in style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , "" sweet sweetback "" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter .  van peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built "" sweet sweetback "" from the ground up almost entirely by himself .  because no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself .  the movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby .  van peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film's responsibilities himself .  he wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role .  he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck .  for instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases "" rated x by an all-white jury , "" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film .  he also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling .  the storyline in "" sweet sweetback "" is deceptively simple .  it takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex .  one day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they're bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder .  however , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously .  acting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death .  the rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico .  although the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked .  van peebles' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored .  at the beginning of "" sweet sweetback , "" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : "" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . ""  van peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration .  of course , with today's abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , "" sweet sweetback "" doesn't seem all that revolutionary .  it is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made .  at that time , "" sweet sweetback "" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it .  distributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles' words , gave the black audience "" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . ""  of course , once it caught on , it caught on big .   "" sweet sweetback "" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates "" sweetback "" from other movies like "" shaft "" ( 1972 ) and "" the mack "" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios .   "" sweet sweetback "" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers .  however , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , "" sweet sweetback "" is certainly not without its controversies .  when it was first released , an article was published in "" ebony "" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it .  there have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of .  others have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives .  still others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm .  nevertheless , a movie like "" sweet sweetback "" cannot be made without conflicting points of view .  it is a revolutionary movie not because it's about one man's defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before .  until that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites .  the fact that "" sweet sweetback "" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply "" the black community "" ) .  van peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between "" sweet sweetback "" and all movies that had come before it .  when the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman .  near the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , "" oh lord , let him die .  don't let them kill him .  let him die on his own . ""  it was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn't even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape .  and , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : "" watch out !  a baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . ""  beyond the political aspects , "" sweet sweetback "" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be .  he squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time .  he shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him .  he makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images .  the only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment .  watching "" sweet sweetback "" more than twenty-five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite .  arguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film .  but there is more to the film than its racial aspect .  the legacy of "" sweet sweetback's baadasssss song "" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him .

""  as good as the crow and spawn are , dark city is better .  where the former two have a specific comic-book following , the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal .  it has a similar look to the others , but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent .  not clever or complex , the story is still fascinating , like a selection from the twilight zone .  a man ( rufus sewell ) is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe .  surprised , the attacker runs off .  the dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a woman's body in the room .  a mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately , so he packs some clothes and leaves , never sure why he's leaving or what he's fleeing .  ghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city , hounding him like figures in a nightmare .  an odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i . d .  the amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch .  now if only he could remember the rest of his life . . . .  dark city is good on many levels .  first , the look of the movie is excellent .  give credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements .  there are visual elements from the american 1920s-60s , mixed with dickens-era urban industrial elements .  it is all pulled together in a sad , dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper's painting , nighthawks .  proyas' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film's world ( for not only does the audience see the city a model , but so do the ghouls ) .  the look is like a cross between tim burton's batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay .  second , the editing of the film is good .  the pacing is on track , and the plot is revealed , the "" amnesia "" explained , in satisfying increments .  also , the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense , caffeinated look .  third , the special effects are well used .  they look good , but more importantly , the right effects are used for the right job .  one example stands out in my mind : the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically .  a simple ripple effect is used .  a more showy effect could have been chosen , but then it would have just been gratuitous .  restraint was shown where necessary , letting the more critical effects look more impressive .  finally , like gattaca , dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance .  unlike gattaca , the story is just open-ended and non-literal enough to be successful .  john murdoch's recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night , and the hopeful coming of the dawn .  his struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind ( at least in his world ) .  when we finally see the big picture of the movie's world , it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of a giant turtle .  a few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave , but i do strongly recommend it , for its look , its pace , its story , and its timelessness .

1|"for the first reel of girls town , you just can't get over lili taylor .  is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student ?  harder still , can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part ?  with the sure , showy expertise of a de niro , taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck-you confidence she can muster .  it's a deeply felt , dead-on performance , and by the halfway point you've forgiven taylor her own maturity .  for all its verite pretenses , girls town is less about a bunch of high-schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer-performers examining their own feelings about rape , relationships , and american womanhood .  the movie's opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart/sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation : patti , angela ( bruklin harris ) , emma ( anna grace ) , and nikki ( aunjanue ellis ) .  but about 10 minutes into the film , we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life .  the remaining girls manage to smug nikki's diary out of her grieving mother's home , and page through it at patti's place , investigating the root of nikki's despair .  what they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned , and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen .  shell-shocked by the truth of the matter , the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives .  emma says she was raped last year on a date with a football player .  patti's barely sympathetic , wondering what the hell emma thought she was doing with her shirt off in a jock's car .  and anyway , patti's had her own share of guys who wouldn't take no for an answer .  pained , acrimonious debate ensues as the trio grow more and more angry -- angry about the impossibility of saying no , and angry with themselves for being weak , for being naive , for putting up with it .   "" why do we put up with it ? ""  emma finally asks , once the argument has reached a fever pitch .   "" we try to talk about it , and look what happens .  we fight for 20 minutes . ""  there's the admirable crux of this picture .  girls town is a political film , in that it calls for action .  but it's incomplete-it's never quite sure how to justify that action , or what form it should take .  the trio become crusaders for their right to dignity , and it's surely one of this year's most stirring movie moments when emma lobs a concrete block through the passenger-side window of that damn jock's car ( doing the right thing ? ) .  they hang out in the bathroom , chatting incessantly and scrawling slogans and naming names on the door to a toilet stall .   "" subvert the patriarchy , "" emma writes , and then starts a hall of shame list underneath that other students begin to contribute to .  the girls silence their hecklers , take revenge on the deadbeat father of patti's child , and eventually come face-to-face with nikki's tormentor .  still , the movie has a desperately unfinished quality , and none of these subsequent exploits is particularly satisfying .   ( you keep waiting for someone to call the cops on these brazen girls , but nobody thinks of it . )  perhaps searching for a resolution missing from the material at hand , the film borrows its epigraphs from audre lorde and queen latifah ( "" who you callin' a bitch ? "" ) .  the points are well taken , but they should have been unnecessary .  long on characterization but a little short on story , girls town is less than it could have been , and too self-congratulatory for my own taste .  director jim mckay is best known as a consort of r . e . m . 's  michael stipe ( he directed the nearly unwatchable tourfilm for that band ) , and girls town is his first foray into feature filmmaking .  the movie was created and scripted by committee , but mckay and his lead performers had to shoot on a shoestring when , predictably , the group couldn't secure funding .  then again , girls town on a budget would hardly be the same film .  the movie's slapdash quality is key to its significance .  truth be told , all three of the leads look too wise for high school , but that's ok -- there's a once-removed quality to their fine , spontaneous performances , as the women take a very skillful look back at the girls they once were , the girls they wish they had been , or some combination .  for all its flaws , this one gets extra points for having its uncertain head and heart in the same noble place .

1|big courtroom thrillers have always captivated america .  o . j .  simpson , tom capano , the menendez brothers .  all these names are synonymous to americans and courtrooms .  and , of course , courtroom dramas are not a new topic to hollywood .  whether it be john grisham's thrilling novels or television's famous dramas , the courtroom has always provided big bucks .  so when i rented a civil action , i was expecting the film to be like the rainmaker , a brilliant law film that kept viewers on the edge of their seat .  however , what i saw in a civil action was far different from what i expected , a major surprise , but fortunately , a pleasant one .  john travolta always seems to come up big when you least expect it .  no one expected him to light up the screen in grease , nor in saturday night fever .  but , whenever he gets knocked down , he always seems to come back fighting .  a civil action is not john's best performance , but a strong one that could rival any performance in 1998 .  travolta proves that a normal and believable performance can vault a film into oscar nominations .  his performance is not flashy , nor memorable , just solid .  if he delivered the only solid performance , this film would still be average .  luckily , he has a strong supporting cast .  william h . macy is probably one of the most underrated actors in hollywood .  he continues to deliver great performances one after the other , but he is still regarded as a secondary actor .  in a civil action , he delivers yet another great performance as travolta's paranoid and greedy accountant .  he is not a lovable character , but a character who stands out in your mind whenever you think of the film .  he is not one of the big time lawyers , just a measly accountant .  but , he delivers one of the best supporting roles of 1998 , but there is actually someone better in a civil action .  robert duvall is also an underrated actor .  he gets many leading roles , but is never heard when you hear of big box office draws like tom hanks , brad pitt and jim carrey .  duvall has a supporting role in this as a lawyer of the co-defendant .  duvall is magical in this role .  he is the wise teacher , who not only battles it out in the courtroom , but also manages to teach every major player a lesson , in his own twisted way .  in many non-comedic films , directors are always trying to find a way to implement a touch of comedy , to keep the audience on their toes .  unfortunately , they usually just key in on one character whose main objective is to be funny ( jar-jar binks , anyone ? ) .  however , this usually backfires because the character is never fully developed .  this is not the case in a civil action .  they have comedy coming from all sides .  whether it be duvall's inane questions or macy's sharp anger , the laughs come in a steady pace .  granted , it's not roll in the aisle funny , but it provides a nice addition to the film .  the plot is terrific- somewhat .  the setup is nice with the film actually starting with a victory in the courtroom .  then the case that will make or break jan ( travolta ) 's career rears its ugly head .  they find out the goldmine involved with the case and wind up taking it .  however , budgets soon flounder and jan finds himself in deep debt .  i will not spoil the rest , although i must speak of the one downside to the film .  the courtroom debates are great , but the actual problem they are fighting for is never fully explored .  it left me somewhat confused , although the rest of the film is terrific .  all in all , john travolta is back yet again in this great film .  his supporting cast , consisting of macy and duvall , turn in tremendous performances , which ease the load on travolta .  the film is smart , witty and thought provoking .  not only does it gauge in-court battles , but also the various tolls it can take on the major players .  a civil action provides everything a drama lover craves .  |0.5833333333333334|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|"The author expresses positive sentiments towards the film ""A Civil Action"", praising the performances of actors such as John Travolta, William H.

1|"it seemed wholly appropriate that at a weekend screening of "" the horse whisperer , "" the start of the film was delayed some twenty minutes due to "" projection difficulties . ""  robert redford's film version of nicholas evans' best-selling novel was supposed to have been in theaters last december , going head-to-head with "" titanic , "" but is only now making its much anticipated debut .  this ( strategic ? )  delay has allowed "" the horse whisperer "" to compete , sans fanfare , against some smaller , unassuming movies during a relatively slower time at the box office .  no matter .  redford's film stands head and shoulders above james cameron's ocean-going tragedy , especially in the writing and acting departments .  whatever the reasons for its postponement , "" the horse whisperer "" supports the old adage "" better late than never . ""  redford has taken evans' book and given it the big screen treatment .  while parts of "" the horse whisperer "" are epic in scope and vision , especially the aerial "" travelogue "" that maps out this great country of ours , its real strength lies in the subtleties it uses to paint the fragile alliance between man and beast .  when her daughter , grace , is involved in a terrible riding accident , hard-driven fashion editor annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) devotes herself to rehabilitating both grace and grace's beloved horse , pilgrim .  refusing to have the hideously disfigured animal put down , annie researches every possible source of information about equine cures before discovering an article about a faith-healing cowboy of sorts called tom booker ( redford ) , who has a way with horses and , perhaps , with people too .  undeterred by tom's initial reluctance to get involved , annie drives grace and a sedated pilgrim across country to meet him , and finally persuades tom to work with the uncontrollable animal .  redford's film unfolds slowly and lovingly , echoing the patience required in healing both physical and psychological wounds .  the film's a little long and , even if you haven't read the book , it's pretty obvious where it's heading--but these are minor complaints .  redford and thomas are strong and convincing as the couple drawn by a mutual affection for the great outdoors and each other , but it's scarlett johansson as grace who shines in a more difficult role .  dianne wiest , chris cooper ( "" lone star "" ) , and sam neill--better than i've seen him before--round out the respectable supporting cast .  and the director's respect for horses is clearly in evidence .  one word of warning , however : while brilliantly shot , the accident scene , involving an out-of-control truck , is extremely disturbing .  redford's canvas is huge and exquisite .  he doesn't hesitate to incorporate vast , sprawling vistas of the american northwest : spectacular , snow-capped mountain ranges , azure skies , and shimmering fields of wheat--all are resplendent in cinematographer robert richardson's viewfinder .  veteran english composer john barry was originally signed to score the film but left the project which is a pity , since "" the horse whisperer "" is "" dances with wolves "" by way of "" out of africa "" ( oscar winners both for barry ) .  fortunately , barry's replacement , thomas newman , contributes a fine score that nicely balances the majesty of montana with the delicate , human conditions--sonorous , string-laden passages that swell with pride playing counterpoint to more poetic , introspective movements ripe with nuance .

1|"charlie sheen stars as zane , a radio astronomer who listens for sounds from other lifeforms .  when he finally gets one , his boss destroys the tape and fires him .  naturally , zane is not ready to give up , and he comes up with an ingenious way to do this himself .  he is aided by a young neighborhood kid and they discover that the sound is coming from mexico .  so zane goes down there to investigate , and runs into a lady studying why the temperature of the earth has dangerously risen so suddenly .  zane is having marital problems at the time , and an offer by her to spend the night with him is very tempting .  hearing charlie sheen deliver the line , "" i guess there is something to be said for celibacy "" is the funniest thing i have ever heard in a movie since matthew broderick discussed asexual reproduction in wargames .  this is just the setup , and i don't want to give too much away , because a large part of the movies fun is the surprises .  charlie sheen , who has had a rocky career as of late , is in top form here .  he is funny , serious , and determined to accomplish his goal .  sheen's absolutely terrific performance is another big plus to this movie .  the story is ingeniously devised by twohy , who also wrote and directed the equally clever cable movie grand tour : disaster in time .  the films major flaw is a very slow pace , and not much happens in the earlygoings .  viewers may be growing restless for a while , but trust me if you stick around and keep your head in it , you will have a good time .

1|"field of dreams almost defies description .  although it's about baseball , it's not a baseball movie .  although the film is extremely spiritual , it's not about religion .  and although field of dreams is melodramatic , it's not a tearjerker .  to really understand what field of dreams is all about , you have to see it .  in the film , kevin costner plays ray kinsella , a baseball fan , '60s berkeley graduate , and iowa farmer .  one day as he is standing in the middle of his expansive corn fields , ray hears a voice ; it tells him : "" if you build it , he will come . ""  then ray has a vision and somehow concludes that if he builds a baseball field in the middle of his corn , shoeless joe jackson will arise from the dead to play ball once again .  and even though it depletes his family's savings and his neighbors think he's crazy , ray clears away the corn and builds a baseball field , complete with bleachers and flood lights .   "" if you build it , he will come . ""  and lo and behold , shoeless joe does come--bringing with him several of his dead teammates .  and then ray hears the voice again ; it tells him to "" ease his pain . ""  ray thinks this means that he must travel to boston to meet terence mann , an influential and radical novelist from the '60s who has since stopped writing and dropped out of society .  with great aplomb , james earl jones plays the disillusioned author who joins forces with ray and embarks with him on a magical and spiritual journey .  the cast in field of dreams is excellent , especially kevin costner in the lead role .  costner gives a quiet , subtle , and moving performance as a man who before building the baseball field had done nothing crazy or spontaneous in his entire life .  costner gives ray just the right mix of enthusiasm and idealism to make us believe in his mystic visions and swallow this wondrous fairy tale .  amy madigan gives a fine supporting performance as ray's feisty and loving wife , who against her better judgement supports her husband's crazy ideas .  in her most impressive scene , madigan vehemently argues against book burning at a p . t . a .  meeting , displaying the sincere passion of a '60s berkeley radical .  ray liotta is appropriately eerie and awe-inspiring as the ghost of shoeless joe , the legendary batter who was suspended from baseball for his involvement in the 1919 chicago "" black sox "" scandal .  and finally , burt lancaster is memorable in a small , but important , role as a small town doctor whose professional baseball career was limited to only one inning .  field of dreams is a touching fairy tale full of life , wonder , mystery , spirit , and humor .  it , for the most part , succeeds in capturing our emotions and suspending our disbelief .  ray kinsella's spiritual quest in pursuit of his dreams proves to be moving and miraculous .  but while field of dreams generally avoids excessive melodrama , it unfortunately does at times go overboard , and by the end it gets down-right sappy .  in general , however , field of dreams is an emotionally satisfying fantasy--one i can recommend to everyone but unromantic cynics .

1|"making a sequel to a widely beloved film is a weighty proposition indeed , especially when the first film is considered by many to be a masterpiece .  when it comes to living up to expectations , a filmmaker is almost doomed to some degree of failure .  for a sequel to live up to or even surpass the original's greatness is very rare indeed .  and whereas "" babe : pig in the city "" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece .  more than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right .   "" babe : pig in the city "" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like "" the godfather : part ii "" and "" the empire strikes back "" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced .   "" babe : pig in the city "" picks up precisely where "" babe "" left off .  having won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status .  a series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs . hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city .  in doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original .   "" babe : pig in the city "" flourishes where so many sequels fail .  most sequels simply rehash the events of the first film .  not "" babe : pig in the city "" .  this is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first .  also , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy .  in essence , it doesn't attempt to copy itself .  instead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own .  and it succeeds .  that's not to say the familiar is absent .   "" babe : pig in the city "" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film .  along with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs . hoggett ( one of this decade's best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski ) .  the three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals .  the story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice .  from there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne's soothingly deep narrative .  composer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these .  but these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting .  while staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals .  monkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new "" urbanites "" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter .  each character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching .  and while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well .  mary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors .  stein's landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature .  we also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions .  not having known who portrayed fugly floom prior to seeing the film , it came as an unexpected pleasant surprise to see who it was .  so as not to ruin this well-kept secret , i won't reveal the actor's identity here .  it was a treat indeed to see one of cinema's legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance .  the greatest triumph of "" babe : pig in the city "" is the art direction .  simply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level .  restricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture .  but the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world's architectural landmarks .  designing a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right ) .  added to that , many of this city's streets are the twin siblings of venice's gondola-trekked rivers .  the metropolis that has sprung from ford's vision is a wondrous sight to behold .  it is a world that you want to walk around in .  norma moriceau's costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford's landscape .  most of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom's clown outfit .  andrew lesnie's photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film's multiple emotional tones .  much press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of "" babe : pig in the city "" .  reports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg-13 rating .  these reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating .  but even so , to be anything harsher than the original' s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms .  by deleting a minimal number of shots , "" babe : pig in the city "" was eventually given the coveted g rating .  although appeased , many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself .  well , to coin a phrase , the reports of "" babe : pig in the city "" 's death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated .  granted it has its moments of pseudo-morbidity , but all-in-all "" babe : pig in the city "" is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be .  whatever "" dark "" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the "" mad max "" trilogy , "" the witches of eastwick "" , "" lorenzo's oil "" ) .  having served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director's chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise .  the story of "" babe : pig in the city "" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn't achieve the emotional or character depth of the original .  missing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual's worth , challenging conformity , and one's purpose in life .   "" babe "" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable .   "" babe : pig in the city "" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones .  this film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on .  but this film's goals aren't as lofty as the first's , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive .   "" babe : pig in the city "" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe .  hoggett's love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality .  best exemplified in hoggett's dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique .  it is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not .  please understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between "" babe : pig in the city "" being a very good film and the original being a great one .  but having said that , these observations are minor critiques at best .  as an overall piece , "" babe : pig in the city "" is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end .  sure , it isn't a great film , but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness .  it is a film that is magical with its charm and humor , exciting in its adventurous exploits , funny with its dry wit and cute voices , and breathtaking in its presentation .   "" babe : pig in the city "" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best , but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema .  as a result , if you choose to let this film pass you by , you will be missing of the year's best cinematic treats .

1|let me first say that the conditions that i was forced to watch the matrix under were less than ideal .  so i have tried to be as fair as possible considering that my viewing experience was significantly less than ideal .  i watched the matrix in a theater that is in serious need of upgrades at the best of times .  under no circumstances , should it have ever been allowed to show a big budget special effects laden film like the matrix .  this theater , owned by the parent company of one of hollywood's biggest studios , hasn't even graduated into stereo sound yet .  the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age .  in other words , the sound sucked .  as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater , bad sound doesn't do anything to add to a film .  i'm not even going to go into the horrible splicing job that the projectionist did putting this film together .  there , i've had my rant , now on with the regularly scheduled review .  which sadly won't include commentary on the film's sound which i'm assuming was spectacular , but i'm just guessing .  my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix .  it is nothing short of stunning visually .  sadly , the rest of the film , while pretty good , doesn't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good .  the matrix has at it's core a good concept , although it strays into the confusing side more often than i would have liked .  keanu reeves plays a computer hacker who is drawn into the frightening realization that reality is just a hoax .  it turns out that that many years ago the world was devastated by some sort of disaster .  now machines run the planet and humans spend their lives in a sort of incubator , plugged into a computer network .  the computers are generating a virtual reality world which is a representation of the earth before it was destroyed .  the population of the planet never realizes that their entire life is a hoax and that they really spend their entire lives as comatose .  that is except a small band who have discovered this horrible secret and have escaped their virtual prisons .  they now spend their lives combating the computers in an effort to expose this lie .  reeve's character , neo , is recruited by this band of rebels led by morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) .  newcomer carrie-anne moss and one of hollywood's most underrated actors , joe pantoliano , join fishburne in the band of freedom-fighters .  the action sequences are nothing short of spectacular .  this can be attributed as much to the amazing special effects as to many of the actor's extensive pre-production training in martial arts .  this lends itself to some of the best martial arts sequences that you are ever likely to see in a film .  when you add this to some of the wild effects in the computer generated world , it all adds up to an eyeful .  as i already said , the visuals far outpace the rest of the film .  acting in the matrix is not bad , but it certainly isn't real good either .  keanu reeves gives his usual fairly emotionless performances .  although to his credit , it is one of his better performances .  laurence fishburne on the other hand often seemed to forget that he was in a sci-fi action film .  more than a few times he delivered his lines as if he thought he was performing in some sort of shakespearean drama .  joe pantoliano was a little under used in this film but he made the most with what he had .  carrie-anne moss turned out a surprisingly good performance for this her first feature film role .  it's nice to see that she was cast as much for her talent as for her breathtaking looks .  you have to give all of the main actors a healthy dose of credit for the work that they obviously put into the physical training for their roles in this film .  it was clear that no small effort went into getting the moves down perfectly for the fighting sequences .  i also put much of the blame for the somewhat strained performances in the matrix on the dialogue , which was terrible at times .  in more than a few places it got way too existential for my liking and at other times it was just plain weird .  it almost seems as though the writers were having a difficult time trying to figure out how to explain the concept for the movie .  so they decided to make the dialogue as obtuse as possible so that no one could figure out what the heck they were talking about .  thereby covering up any leaps of faith that they may have had to make in the departments of logic and believability .  my other major complaint with the matrix was with the very unsatisfying ending .  the setup for it was hokey and frankly used in many a bad film before .  the ending itself was just plain strange .  the main reasons to recommend the matrix are the visual effects and computer animation which make this a real treat to watch .  while the rest of the film ( acting , dialogue and to a degree plot ) detract from the high production values , they don't detract enough to prevent me from recommending the matrix as a fun way to spend an evening .  |-0.21666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|The overall sentiment is slightly negative as

1|"alchemy is steeped in shades of blue .  kieslowski's blue , that is .  with its examination of death , isolation , character restoration , and recovery from loss , suzanne myers' new independent film echoes the polish director's internationally-acclaimed 1993 release .  language aside , the principal difference between the films is that , while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character's world , alchemy keeps its viewers at arm's length .  as a result , while we're able to appreciate the film's intellectual tapestry , it is emotionally distant .  alchemy is divided into three chapters : "" charity "" , "" faith "" , and "" hope "" .  while there are common themes and story elements running through all three , the single constant is the main character , a sculptor/russian translator named louisa ( rya kihlstedt ) .  when the film opens , she's living with her painter boyfriend , whom she believes to be cheating on her .  following his sudden death in an automobile accident , louisa's life is thrown into turmoil .  events swirls around her , and she can't find a source of stability .  in her quest to make sense out of her loss , she befriends her late boyfriend's mistress , visits her ill sister , and , eventually , abandons her old life by joining a "" back-to- nature "" cult .  alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues .  in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one , it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process , the meaning of love , and the nature of art .  does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar ?  are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life , with all of its various distractions , to the fullest ?  myers' challenge is to make these subjects , art film staples , engrossing in a new context .  through louisa's struggles , she succeeds .  while alchemy isn't always emotionally appealing , it never loses its fascination .  even when we're not connecting with louisa , who is often more of a locus for ideas than a fully-developed personality , there's enough material on-screen to hold our attention .  the cinematography is stunning .  city scenes are tinted with blue , adding a cold , bleak dimension to the film's early portions .  later , when louisa reaches the "" wilderness "" , we're treated to a dazzling array of autumnal splendor -- brightly-colored leaves in the trees and on the ground .  it's a startling-but-effective visual contrast that emphasizes the changes taking place in louisa's life as she travels the road back to emotional stability .  the title refers to the practice of a group of mystical faith- healers who use "" alchemy "" to provide for the needs of the body and soul .  and , although louisa partakes of their peculiar brand of medicine , it's ultimately love and companionship , not alchemy , that brings solace .  her pain is assuaged only when she lets go of the belief that the inherent safety of being alone is life's ultimate goal .  even though louisa's final transformation lacks the impact it could have possessed had she been a more vital character , it's still an intriguing and enlightening process to watch .  alchemy isn't pure magic , but , especially during its best moments , it's close .

1|"who would have thought ?  jim carrey does drama .  when i first saw the advertisement for the truman show , i thought , "" what a hilarious idea for a movie ! ""  however , it was an even better premise for a drama .  the truman show takes us into a world that revolves around one man .  that man is truman burbank ( jim carrey ) .  truman has no clue what is really going on in his world and frankly , cristof wants to keep it that way .  christof is the "" god "" of this made-up world .  he keeps everything running and gives the actors their roles .  there were a few attempts to tell truman about his world , but they failed and life went on as normal .  the opening parts of the film introduce to truman's world .  we see what he is doing at his current age , then we get a flashback at his past .  it may seem a tad boring , but it is so intriguing that you will fall in love with the film right from the start .  the film can be described in one word : weird .  it seems like such a simple idea , yet it is something that a majority of us would never think of , but andrew niccol did .  it seems like a warped idea , but it is andrew's idea and he did wonders with it .  jim carrey actually lived up to the hype .  the hype , whether good or bad , always focused on carrey's ability to do drama .  no one doubted how extraordinary this film could be , the only thing they doubted was carrey .  and he showed them all up .  jim carrey was snubbed at the oscars .  i do not think he was the best actor , but he deserved the nomination .  he plays truman burbank , the unsuspecting star of the most popular television show in the world .  he has lived a normal life for almost thirty years , but then strange things start happening .  he ventures into the wrong elevator .  a light crashes in front of him .  his father comes back and is then pulled away .  we are constantly teased with all of this and we know it is a show , but truman does not .  and it is just a constant progression that never gets sluggish .  carrey is able to shed his comedy to play a major role in a major drama .  laura linney is magnificent as the camera hungry wife .  she plays her role as advertiser and budding star to a point .  peter weir does not make the cast perfect , and their flaws eventually lead to truman's escape .  the story unfolds until the show becomes too big and everything crashes down .  despite carrey's greatness , the best performance in the truman show undoubtedly is turned in by ed harris , who plays the "" god "" of truman's world .  he displays the pressure he is under , the world he has created .  he becomes so paranoid that he believes he is a god and that truman has him to thank for his sham of a life .  the action moves at a good pace , and rarely gets sluggish .  but , the main point of the film is how it looks like a television show .  it really makes you think .  maybe your brother is an actor , maybe your best friend is in heated contract negotiations to stay on the show .  some of the best parts of the film are when truman ventures into the wrong elevator and sees cast members drinking coffee and talking .  or when truman tunes into the wrong station and hears orders being said for truman's arrival .  and when christof focuses in on truman and cues the dramatic music as marlon ( noah emmerich ) delivers his dramatic line .  all of these ideas are just perfect for the film and extremely innovative .  i was not only enjoying the film , i was overwhelmed by genius of it .  overall , the truman show is one of the freshest and innovative films to come out of hollywood .  jim carrey shows that he is not just a man of a million faces , but a legitimate actor who could go down as one of the best .  andrew niccol is responsible for the screenplay and peter weir pulled it off to perfection .  the truman show is a must see for anyone who likes movies in general because they will be thoroughly impressed by this creative film .

1|"capsule : this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii , life in a japanese prison camp .  to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity .  the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone's taste .   , +3 ( -4 to +4 )  more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way .  this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law .  during world war ii , of course , the one goal was winning the war .  this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal .  when the japanese had captured prisoners , they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal .  minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output .  while the germans , not known for their kindness in those days , had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war , the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27% .  the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad .  that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do .  the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day .  and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll .  in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany .  filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story , perhaps for fear of offending the japanese .  there are comparatively few films about the japanese pow camps .  certainly there was david lean's the bridge on the river kwai .  there were some low-budget british exploitation films and that was about it .  then there were tv series "" a town like alice "" and "" tenko . ""  lest the experience be forgotten we have a new film to end all wars directed by david cunningham and written by brian godawa .  it is based on the account of ernest gordan who survived the horror of that world war ii prison camp and went on to become for 26 years the dean of the chapel at princeton university .  the film while realistic shows the conditions in the camp as being considerably more brutal and sadistic than bridge on the river kwai portrayed them .  the story opens with six or so soldiers being marched into the prison camp only to be immediately placed in front of a firing squad .  it turns out to be a grim joke , one of many that the sadistic japanese play to amuse themselves .  beating and torture are commonplace events .  men already imprisoned tell the new arrivals to enjoy the last of their health ; it will not last long with parasites and disease almost inevitable .  however , unlike as in kwai , the prisoners want to avoid going to the hospital , called by the prisoners the death house .  so goes a war within a war with the prisoners trying to maintain their humanity and with the japanese trying to make them interchangeable and highly expendable cogs in a rail-laying machine .  this is more than just a battle of who will win the war but a battle of ideologies .  the japanese believe that the individual is nothing , that conformity to group's norms is all that gives a life meaning .  conformity is purpose .  before the film is over there will be some surprising revelations about the character of the prisoners and the character of those running the camp .  if this story showed nothing but sadism from the japanese it would be one kind of story .  if the british ( with one american , by the way ) and the japanese learned to respect each other it would be another kind of story .  it is neither .  it is a stirring and believable account of camp life .  the color has been distorted in the film to give a washed out yellow .  this serves a double purpose for cunningham .  it gives an effect of technicolor film that has been left in heat .  it also creates a distancing effect .  the only touch that seems a little out of place is the use of gaelic music .  this is a powerful and philosophical view of the prison camp experience .  i rate it a 9 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +3 on the -4 to +4 scale .

1|another 'independent film' , this comedy , which was brought by miramax for $5 million , is good fun .  favreau and vaughn ( the lost world : jurassic park , 1997 ) play mike and trent , two everyday 20somethings on the lookout for women .  the film just basically follows their plight on the lookout for lurve , and along the way we get to meet some of their friends , see their attempts at chatting up girls , and just basically get a insight into their lives .  and all of this is great fun .  swingers doesn't rely on huge special effects , or big name stars to provide entertainment .  no , it just has a great script and superb little known actors .  the script , by favreau , is great .  mike is always missing is girlfriend , who hasn't called him for six months , and every time he meets a girl , he always end up telling her about the ex .  the audience feels for this pathetic little man , thanks to the great script .  vaughn is 'the money' ( swingers speak for 'the best' ) as the womanizing trent , always on the lookout for a new girl .  some of his chat-up lines are awful , but he always seems to get the girl thanks to his 'hard man' nature .  vaughns character also gets the best laugh in the film , towards the end in a diner .  the conversations that go on between mike and trent are great , but it never quite reaches tarantino standards ( which i suspect the film was trying to reach . )  there are some excellent , laugh out loud jokes in the film , and some superbly funny set pieces ( such as favreau cringe-worhy battle with a answer machine that always cut him off before he finishes his sentence .  embarrassing to him , hilarious to the audience . )  mike & trents friends are also good , although there characters seem a bit underwritten , and we never really learn as much as we would like about them .  although this is primarily mike and trents film , it would of been nice to learn a bit more about their friends .  they just seem to wander aimlessly in the background .  but again , the lines they say are usually pretty good , and they do have some funny parts .  it's just a shame that they didn't have more meatier roles .  the acting is superb .  as said above , vaughn is superb as trent , he's definitely the best thing in the film .  favreau is also good , acting as 'the little man' very well , and the way he always feels sorry for himself is very funny .  graham ( boogie nights , 1997 ) has a small but good role as lorraine , a girl mike finally falls in love with .  she hardly features in the film at all , but she still manages to make an impact on the audience .  swingers , then , is funny , but it does have some flaws .  firstly , the running time is a bit too short .  the film comes to an abrupt halt , and i actually wanted the film to carry on longer .  it never really comes to a satisfying conclusion , which is a shame , as most films are too long !  also , this type of film has been done too many times , such as sleep with me ( 1994 ) .  but these small flaws don't really spoil what is a funny , entertaining comedy .  |0.6999999999999998|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|The majority of the explanations suggest a positive sentiment towards the film, highlighting its entertaining and funny aspects along with praise for the script and acting.

1|"a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal .  a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation-state against another .  a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain .  a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end .  if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy , the violence continues .  it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone ( even total innocents ) , anywhere , at anytime that gives the figure his label .  edward zwick's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states .  you'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines .  arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad , and the u . s . responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack .  however , unlike the real-life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden's camp and manufacturing facility , the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal .  in retaliation , the terrorists bring the fight to the new world .  unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent-in-charge anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , who works out of the bureau's new york office at one federal plaza .  while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple , he encounters cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , also trying to uncover information .  generally , the fbi is charged with problems inside the u . s . , while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm .  even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country .  hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory , but as the two form a tentative professional relationship , hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government .  the original tagline for patriot games was , "" there has never been a terrorist attack on american soil . ""  however true , it was pulled before the movie's release because it sounded too much like a dare .  revisiting the scenario of foreign terrorists committing acts of violence in the united states , the siege is almost an invitation in itself , because it shows just what kind of turmoil could be produced if an effective terrorist network were to set up operations here in america .  admittedly , the terror wrought upon new york is a bit excessive ( who's going to believe that a few bombs are going to cause new yorkers to jump at the backfire of a bus or to curtail their shopping by two-thirds ? ) , but the basic premise is still valid .  i liked the fact that this film rises above the basic action-thriller fare of good guy g-men against bad guy terrorists by exploring some of the effects on society and law and order .  it provides a very possible hypothesis that violent activity on the part of a few arabs would escalate into a series of hate crimes against the arab-american population , and that in an effort to find the terrorists , the civil liberties of the minority may be violated by the government itself .  in fact , about halfway through the film , when the president authorizes the declaration of martial law within new york city , the liberties of all americans are put at risk .  although it may actually be a side effect of a terrorist campaign , the demise of social order in america is a scary thought and a goal which would not be beneath many international terrorist groups .  throughout , the film maintains a conflict between hubbard , who wants to use the fbi to pursue the terrorists within the letter of the law , and general devereaux ( bruce willis ) , who is in command of the army and of the mind that the greater good would be better served by suspending the law and pursuing the terrorists more forcefully .  what results is a fascinating debate over the appropriateness and constitutionality of the declaration of martial law and the invocation of the war powers act , utilizing philosophy and historical examples to make points on both sides .  it actually gets rather heady at times , but it's a credit to screenwriters zwick , lawrence wright , and menno meyjes that they don't underestimate the intelligence of the audience .  i don't know if it's his tone or inflection or something else , but denzel washington has a way of spitting out dialog that makes whatever he says sound great .  this , combined with his innate acting ability and his experience in playing the mid-level authority figure , makes his performance in the siege convincing and enjoyable .  annette bening gives one of the more assertive portrayals of a female character i've seen recently , and the chemistry she shares with washington is palpable .  it's somewhat unfortunate that her character's fortitude is broken at a certain point , but it allows us to watch bening play a little more range .  bruce willis is pretty much relegated to a tough-guy role , always standing straight , and with a permanent scowl fixed upon his face .  however , the tension that exists between devereaux and hubbard is a major drive behind the film's development .  notable is tony shalhoub who plays fbi agent frank haddad , a lebanese immigrant .  the role calls for evidencing both a kind of filial pride for his heritage , and contempt for those of his own race who might interfere with his integration into the american society .  difficult to say the least , shalhoub does it with a naturalness you can almost reach out and touch .  perhaps best known for his role as antonio the cab driver in the nbc sitcom "" wings , "" shalhoub gained notoriety for his dramatic abilities in the wonderful film big night .  whereas denzel washington seems to be edward zwick's favorite actor ( he directed washington in glory and courage under fire ) , james horner seems to be his favorite composer .  i therefore found it odd that zwick chose the prolific score-writer graeme revell ( seven films this year already ) over horner for the siege until i realized that this film contained a lot of arabian-themed music , and horner's record has shown more of a propensity for scores either neutral in ethnicity or irish-sounding at most .  revell does a good job at providing appropriate music to punctuate key scenes and allowing the score to enhance the movie as a whole .  it's nowhere near as intrusive as in some of the other films we've been getting throughout the year .  missteps in the siege can be found in a couple of the excesses it takes .  for example , it's pretty clear throughout that the film is meant to be more of thriller than an action flick .  unfortunately , there's a scene where the army just cuts loose against some arab immigrants in a blatant display of firepower and explosions , obviously meant for the sole purpose of being eye-catching .  in the middle of the city ( and against no real opposition ) , zwick even has the army use a cobra attack helicopter to shoot rockets into a building no farther than 50 feet from friendly troops .  verisimilitude really goes out the window at that point .  the film also gets a little preachy toward the end , focusing on the ability of different races to get along .  a noble gesture , the film just puts the message across a bit too obviously .  these flaws are glaring , but they don't detract too much from an otherwise good film that makes you think about issues you may not have considered since history class .

1|"very few people would be unaware of beavis & butt-head ( both created and narrated by mike judge ) .  they are the two animated mtv characters who have the most annoying laughter know to human kind .  you may have seen them on their television program , as they snigger and make lude remarks about women , anything related to sex , and the music film clips that they watch .  in beavis & butt-head do america the pair finally make their big screen debut , to the delight of some , and the deplore of others .  beavis & butt-head ( yes , those are their real names ) , are two very ugly teenagers with extremely warped minds driven by raging hormones .  they live their lives in front of the television .  the worst possible event occurs to the pair when their television is stolen .  this happens as they sleep , and when they awake it takes them a few minutes just to decipher that the television has gone .  beavis even tries to use the remote , though there is no television there .  the two spot a van outside and two sinister looking men carrying a television .  even at this point they have no idea what has happened .  they look around , seeing all the evidence , but are completely oblivious to the fact that these men have just stolen their television .  before the movie i knew that they were stupid , but i didn't realise just how stupid .  this is typical of their behaviour throughout the film .  eventually they realise that their television has been stolen , so they leave their sofa to go search for a television .  luck would have it that they stumble into a hotel room ( looking for a television ) where a man is awaiting two guys whose task it is to kill his wife .  this man , thinking that beavis & butt-head are the assigned killers , tells them that they can have $10 , 000 if they "" do his wife "" .  beavis & butt-head , being the ignorant fools that they are , think that he is offering them $10 , 000 dollars to have sex with his good looking wife .  they are taken to the airport where they fly to las vegas to "" do her "" .  to them , this is the best day of their lives .  not only are they going to lose their virginity ( one of their lifelong aims ) , but most importantly , they will have enough money to buy a big screen tv .  inevitably they become caught up in a huge crime , and unbeknown to them , are tracked across the country by the fbi .  oddly enough , it is their complete stupidity that spares them from being caught , as a result the fbi is convinced they are criminal masterminds .  they end up travelling right across america , visiting places such as the hoover dam and washington dc .  the irony is that although they visit so many grand and spectacular locations , their one time out in the big world away from their television , they are completely oblivious to it .  at old faithful they are far more fascinated with the infra-red operated urinals than with the geyser itself .  beavis & butt-head essentially have the journey of their lives .  they even get to meet the president .  but all they care about is getting their television back , and losing their virginity .  this is one of the many reasons that the film is so funny - it's unbelievable just how stupid they are , and how they can be so oblivious to everything around them .  the humour is certainly crude , but then beavis & butt-head are just that ; crude , lude and rude .  in the end you can't help but feel sorry for them , a pair of anti-social couch potatoes whose life is television .  in this respect , and also with regard to authority ( such as the fbi ) mike judge is quite critical of amercian society .  if you are easily offended , or find this pair particularly annoying , steer clear .  otherwise , it should keep you laughing the whole way through .  one note of warning : don't take friends who like to imitate beavis & butt-head . . . . . you'll  never hear the end of it !
