1|there's a moment in schindler's list when a number of jews are trudging through snow , clean and crisp , dark edges and frost on the ground .  one girl waltzes through , wearing a red dress that stings the eyes .  it is probably the finest moment through out the film .  when i first saw it i began to cry , though i could not say why .  this landscape is the setting of many small moments that add up to one big whole .  when one man is shot in the head we see blood oozing out onto the ground -- so black and murky , its almost pomegranate red .  at another time we follow a young boy as he runs , searching for a hiding spot before finally squeezing into a toilet -- which is already occupied .  like so ( citizen kane , fargo , the godfather , the godfather part ii , greed , ) many of the greatest american films , schindler's list plays with the concepts of money , power , and soul .  but this is a movie about a man who does the right thing .  starkly emotional , and brutally powerful , schindler's list strips away everything on the outset and leaves us ony feelings .  the following that it has gained is not suprising -- this is probably , thus far , the best film of the decade .  steven spielberg has always been a skilfull filmmaker -- his assured hand churned out both jurassic parks , jaws , the indiana jones films , and e . t .  -- but it wasn't until 1993 that we saw what a brilliant man he can be .  the product of his genuis is really something to see -- it can bring tears to your eyes just as it uplifts you .  throughout , we sense the deep control which he so masterfully spreads .  we watch oskar schindler ( liam neeson ) grow from an arrogant , self important man who hires jews only to save money into a moving figure , with a deep sense of pride and accomplishment .  the film requires much work , and can be a harrowing experience -- go expecting a quick entertainment and you'll be bitterly dissapointed .  it does reward the patient viewer .  this is a mature spielberg , and his deft hands shape an absoloute masterpiece .  this eqsuisite , beautiful film is a rare gem .  it does a good job of summarizing why i love movies .  it leaves one breathless , uplifted , and with much to think about .  afterwards you can reflect on individual images , visions , and people .  laconic , removed , schindler strides through the film a detached prescence who watches all , does much , and leaves feeling as if he could , should , have done more then he did and was able to .  the change seems natural -- in the hands of a lesser filmmaker , it would be crude and would cheat the audience .  instead we are told a tale , told a story .  the film is punishing to watch , yes .  but anyone who allows themselves to get involved will experience a miracle , and a genuine masterpiece of a movie .  |0.23333333333333336|0.85|0.9333333333333332|"The overall sentiment towards the movie ""Schindler's List"" is positive, with descriptions such as ""rare gem,"" ""masterpiece,"" and ""exquisite"" highlighting its emotional and powerful impact.

1|i recall the trials and tribulations of my high school years .  it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood .  but of all the experiences that i collected throughout those tender years , i can honestly say that the toughest and the scariest thing that i had to cope with was my raging hormones and my crazed curiosity about girls and sex .  yes , more scarier than my seventh grade english teacher and even scarier than the bullies that constantly hounded me , trying to deal with my personal wonderment about sex was like trying to fight an invisible monster .  for all teenagers , it's almost like a rite of passage .  and what we did was sometimes downright nasty , sometimes funny , and sometimes shocking .  and all of that is terrifically and shamelessly brought to light in what might be the funniest movie this summer .  `american pie' is a comedy about four sexually frustrated seniors that enter into a pact to lose their virginity by the end of the school year .  just how great are their hormones raging ?  one of them notes , after watching disney's the little mermaid , that ariel is soooo hot .  the four schoolmates are kevin , oz , finch and jim .  kevin is the only one with a steady girlfriend , but doesn't want to have sex until the time is just right .  but what is the perfect time ?  there is just no way to know , and that frightens him .  oz is the big jock who decides that the way to score with the girls is to listen to them and to be more sensitive .  he joins up with a jazz choir and discovers that getting in touch with his feminine side has some tremendous advantages .  finch is the phobic hermit who doesn't stand a chance with any girl .  so , he pays someone $200 to start spreading rumors about his prowess .  suddenly , girls are lining up to go out with him .  but among these friends , it is jim that is the most curious and the most fearful .  when he has a chance to romp with a pretty exchange student , his inexperience comes shining through .  he has much to learn , and will do anything to seek out this kind of knowledge .  this may include watching scrambled porn channels or experimenting with mom's apple pie in a scene that is completely shocking , raunchy , yet unbelievably funny .  the one thing that i want to say about this film is that it well deserves its `r' rating .  there is stuff in here that is completely gross in the same manner that `there's something about mary' was gloriously ribald .  in fact , at first this film received a sinful nc-17 rating before a couple of more cuts finally brought it down to a teen-accessible rating .  but i guess after seeing the no-holds-barred coarseness of south park , this seems tame by comparison .  teens and anyone who can still remember their acne years are the ones that will laugh hardest .  but unlike many teen sex comedies , there is a genuine intelligence at work here .  these are four normal boys who have a natural curiosity about sex .  their plans of action are thoughtful and they think about the consequences .  they know what they want , yet temper it with responsibility .  but almost always , it's impossible to know how to fight the invisible monster , and it's these episodes that make `american pie' such a carnal delight to watch .  |0.3|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|"The text has a slightly negative sentiment due to the challenges of high school and hormones, but there is also an element of humor and self-awareness that neutralizes the overall sentiment.

1|full metal jacket , very much like every other hard-hitting film about the vietnam war , is an shocking , emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america .  this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man ( private joker , played by matthew modine ) during his tour in the vietnam war .  however , full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before : boot camp .  these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film , even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning .  as in platoon , full metal jacket gets off to a quick start .  the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits , which is getting their heads shaved .  from there , they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman , played extremely well by the former drill instructor r . lee ermey .  apparently , the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies , because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations .  private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant , as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence ( vincent d'onofrio ) , whom is dubbed 'gomer pyle' by sgt .  hartman .  the film is continually narrated by private joker , in which he explains his visions on what is going on .  the entire corps , although repeatedly hammered by sgt .  hartman , continues on .  private pyle , however , seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor .  he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation , and it basically does not stop .  that is , until sgt .  hartman comes up with a new plan .  he will punish the rest of the soon-to-be-marines for pyle's goof-ups , even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can .  pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits , and things take a turn for the worst .  pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally , physically , and mentally cut out for the life of a marine .  after graduation , joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war , which is his service .  he is not a member of the infantry , and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat .  when he sets out on a documenting mission , this question becomes very clear from the start .  joker joins up with a platoon , along with his hometown friend cowboy ( arliss howard ) , and follows their everyday actions , interviewing and filmming them along the way .  he also soon finds himself in a position in which he must fight , or die .  again , as in the tradition of vietnam war films , full metal jacket can be debated as to whether it is an anti-war film or not .  a few of the more powerful scenes toward the end will leave you to decide .  full metal jacket succeeds extremely well in documenting the life of a young man in vietnam , as have others in the past .  this film , in different ways , also can be viewed as more powerful than others .  that , again , is up for debate and depends on your opinion .  one thing is for sure , however ; no one ever wants to experience the absolute hell that these soldiers are subjected to .  unfortunately , many did .  |0.26666666666666666|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|"The majority of the explanations express a positive sentiment towards the film ""Full Metal Jacket"", emphasizing its powerful depiction of the emotional impact and struggles of the Vietnam War, as well as the strong performances and shocking nature of the film."
1|"oliver stone's latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents .  it's a three-hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century .  stone doesn't hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house .  the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done .  at the same time he creates a very human character , a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics , which is here pictured as a wild animal .  he is simply trying to tame it .  but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president's ability to control them .  stone doesn't in any way apologize for nixon .  he blames not only nixon's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself , the system that , once set in motion , behaves with a mindlessness of its own .   "" nixon "" is a modern shakespeare story - a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws .  there's something almost majestic about the process : as nixon goes down in this film , there is no gloating , but a watery sigh , as of a great ship sinking .  sir anthony hopkins is staggering and plays nixon with incredible honesty and understanding , creating a very emotional picture of the 37th american president .  joan allen's magnificent and captivating performance is certainly worth an oscar statuette .  she is strong and loyal as mrs . nixon .  the rest of the cast is equally magnificent , including : james woods , j . t . walsh , paul sorvino , ed harris and bob hoskins .  everyone does a serious and demanding job , no one are disappointing .  stone never loses focus and his direction is steddy , honest and determined .  he is displaying the historical facts and at the same time concentrating at the human element .  at times he is showing to black and white showing flashbacks from nixon's youth and childhood .  the flashy editing by brian berdan and frank corwin , robert richardson's rich cinematography and john williams' musical score create a hectic and bizarre atmosphere .  the film's only fault is that it's a bit tiering and overloaded with too much political material and legal maneuvers .  still it's an honest and captivating - a solid piece of movie making .

1|in tim burton's `sleepy hollow' , there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name .  he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe .  burton's update on washington irving's classic tale of `the legend of sleepy hollow' offers us the mystery of the horseman , when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror .  writer andrew kevin walker ( `seven' ) throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes , but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing , as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine .  as `sleepy hollow' opens , we're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau , who won an oscar in burton's `ed wood' .  landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow , who , on a fateful carriage ride through the forest , is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider .  after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town , constable ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is sent in to investigate .  landlord baltus von tassel ( michael gambon ) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case , and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper ( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken ) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods .  crane is not a man of great superstition , and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets ( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie ) .  first and foremost , `sleepy hollow' is a fun horror film .  as with virtually all burton movies , we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman , who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly .  the horseman f/x are stylish and impressive , particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors .  but why did i enjoy `sleepy hollow' as much as i did ?  although enjoyable , it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted left and right . .  it was the light comic touch that burton applied .  the film has the sweetness of a candy apple , usually channeled through depp's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane , who is no longer a mild-mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities .  this is certainly not the only alteration that's been made .  as the film progresses , it becomes apparent that walker is more concerned with the mystery of the murders than the murders themselves .  the momentum is slowed considerably once crane begins piecing the mystery together , because for the audience , it's not an issue we particularly wish to be solved .  it's more effective for the headless horseman to be an elusive demon than an elusive demon with an ulterior motive .  still , we are still captivated by the breathtaking technical detail and burton's keen eye to capture our attention .  the costuming is exceptional , and the dialogue is crisp and effective throughout ( it's recognizable that the script was refined by award-winning playwright tom stoppard ) .  the supporting cast exhibits more color and playfulness than many .  a blonde christina ricci is in fine form as von tassel's daughter katrina , and an unlikely romance between she and ichabod is surprisingly consistent .  walken , michael gough ( who appeared in burton's `batman' films ) and miranda richardson are all enjoyable in tackling their separate roles .  i suppose the strengths behind `sleepy hollow' lie within the central trio : director burton , constable depp and the headless horseman who hunts him down with ruthless accuracy .  all of this is not to be taken seriously , of course .  `sleepy hollow' is a lavish , frightening and altogether amusing reworking of a classic tale that many people cherished as children .  if you've got a decent head on your shoulders , you'll have the good sense to gallop off to the theater and enjoy it one last time .  |0.5463333333333332|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|"The sentiment of the explanations is mostly positive, as they highlight the captivating visuals, enjoyable performances, and light comic touch of Tim Burton's film ""Sleepy Hollow.""

1|"ok , i admit i had a bad attitude about this film from the start .  a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents ?  with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure ?  yuck .  but it's not really too bad .  it has a lot working against it , for me at least .  in addition to the above , it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made-for-tv movie , but longer and with bigger stars , and you have to pay to see it .  it does win you over , though , even if it is painfully predictable .  just think about it : two single parents , with their cute kids , are thrown together due to a missed field trip .  through a day of near disasters , they cont inually meet , get in one another's way , cause trouble for one another , and generally insult one another at every opportunity .  in fact , they hate each other so much that we know that they are , or soon will be , in love .  the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples .  so this film is predictable , just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable ( and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman's model for this film ) .  will they get fired from their yuppie jobs ?  will they make the big soccer game that is so important to their kids ?  will pfeiffer realize what a jerk her ex-husband , a drummer for bruce springsteen , really is ( aren't they all ? ) ?  will they finally kiss ?  well , what do you expect ?  but there is a certain amount of satisfaction in having our expectations fulfilled , especially when it is done with as much humour , along with a lack of sticky sentimentality , as it is in this film .  pfeiffer and clooney have a certain chemistry together that is surprisingly charming , and the kids are neither shoved into the background nor allowed to steal the show .  one word of caution , though .  this film is being billed in some places as a "" family "" movie .  don't let that stop you .  however , i think most kids , especially boys , would be pretty bored by this move .  after all , nobody gets killed and there are no explosions .  all in all , a good , non-offensive date movie .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

1|bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one .  the screenplay , written by co-star steve martin , skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science-fiction movies to chop-socky fight sequences , and all in a crafty and accomplished manner .  anyone who knows of , or has had any association with movie-making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it's entire duration .  the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one .  bobby bowfinger ( martin ) , a cheapskate and small-time hollywood producer , has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so .  a new script , an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain , has caught bowfinger's eye .  after confronting a big-name producer named jerry renfro ( robert downey jr . ) in a restaurant , an agreement is made to finance the movie .  but first , bowfinger must get renowned action star kit ramsey ( eddie murphy ) to sign in on the project .  kit turns the offer down immediately , but bowfinger still has the intent to shoot the film .  after emptying out his life savings , the hapless producer tells the remaining cast and crew that ramsey is involved , and then prepares to film the movie without the star's knowledge .  the actors confront ramsey on the street , saying their lines as hidden cameras peek through bushes to capture the footage .  the unknowing star , who is terrified of aliens and being abducted , is brought to believe there is actually pod people after him .  when the conditions become even more treacherous , bowfinger is forced to hire a kit ramsey look-alike named jiff ( also murphy ) , a sweet-natured dork who runs for coffee in-between shooting vital scenes .  these include attempting a suicide run across an 8-lane freeway , and one of the `hot' scenes involving supporting actress daisy ( heather graham ) removing her blouse .  bowfinger takes it's sweet time getting started , but when the plot switches into high gear , great things happen .  certain scenes are so precisely executed , perfectly framing moments that are absolutely fall-down funny .  no , hilarious .  standouts include the chase through a parking garage in which ramsey , who's supposed to be being followed , keeps checking behind him to investigate a strange tapping noise ( it's actually bowfinger's dog in high heels ) .  and just try not to laugh in the climactic kung-fu sequence , featuring jiff in an excerpt from another bowfinger classic entitled fake purse ninjas .  while the entire 97-minutes of bowfinger isn't always on target , individual scenes may have you rolling in the aisles .  masterful comedy director frank oz ( dirty rotten scoundrels , in and out ) , who has never made a bad movie , ensures a quality final product and is aided immensely by martin's sharp-edged script .  however , the real on-screen star is eddie murphy .  this is the actor's finest work since his breakthrough into the hollywood market in the early 80's .  murphy excels at every corner , not only succeeding with presenting believable paranoia in the eyes of kit ramsey , but in creating a likable buffoon in jiff as well .  these three talented comic minds have squeezed every morsel of potential out of this premise , and the reward is a virtually guaranteed helping of hearty laughs .  steve martin generates the power behind bowfinger , but murphy fuels it .  this is a summer-time comedy that , unlike something such as american pie and south park , doesn't break any rules .  but it's still just as uproarious , or perhaps even more side-splitting than anything we've seen this season .  the supporting cast , including christine baranski as a work-loving actress and jamie kennedy as the cameraman , all perform well within their limits .  the only presence that demands real attention when placed next to martin or murphy is the beautiful heather graham , as the young film star who has plans to sleep her way to the top .  graham , attempting to further her stardom after appearing as the new powers' girl in ap2 , displays a cheerful but naive persona that nicely corresponds with the wackiness of the screenplay .  i wouldn't be caught dead buying a ticket for chubby rain , but watching how it all came about is certainly entertaining enough .  |0.3333333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.9|"The majority of the explanations have a positive sentiment, praising the screenplay, comedy, performances, and standout scenes of ""Bowfinger.""

1|"pulp fiction , quentin tarantino's anxiously awaited and superb follow-up to reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all-time .  in all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it .  as if reservoir dogs wasn't perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way .  every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor .  to begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l . jackson ) .  these two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect .  travolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role .  if these two characters were not enough , there's the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small-time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the "" problem solver "" himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel ) .  these are just the major characters .  smaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far-out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men "" behind "" ( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film .  the film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other .  the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold-ups .  the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead .  after this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle .  utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants .  the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace .  after basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase .  this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a . 357   "" hand cannon "" , shooting at the two gangsters .  he somehow completely misses them , leading jules to cite divine intervention .  this is also the basis for more of the now-famous tarantino dialogue .  the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades .  butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight , but when he does not , marsellus vows to find him , wherever he is , and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune .  vincent , meanwhile , has the honor of taking marsellus' wife , mia , out on a date while the big man is out of town .  vincent , obviously , is rather nervous about this , especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage .  after their date , which seems to rather smoothly , things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent's high-priced heroin , dubbed a "" monster "" by lance .  each story continually progresses , and new and amazing events occur .  eventually , the stories all meet each other in the end , with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant , which happens to contain both vincent and jules .  pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all-time .  along with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not only latch onto you , but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you .  and with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering .  surely , quentin tarantino's fame was greatly escalated by this film , and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon .

1|"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files .  first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie .  the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable .  you have to reach for a larger audience .  therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly .  altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange .  but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on .  you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera .  in any case , the answer is no .  i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium .  however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie .  i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new .  everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others .  i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie .  warning : major spoilers follow !  please do not read , to fully enjoy this movie you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about .  you have been warned .  the x-files is what a summer should be .  exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances .  this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank .  from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you .  when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon .  this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes .  in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue .  you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd !  the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid .  you know , when you are affraid to put you feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ?  so yeah , the x-files is scary .  and guess what ?  you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster .  do not think that the x-files is a monster movie .  in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total .  no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series .  scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time .  she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much .  no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight .  by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" showers "" independence day .  if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" showering "" godzilla instead .  to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who  cares ! ?  if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ?  the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous .  the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill .  the script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose .  if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! !  unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects .  miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense .  also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don't !  the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation .  there is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ?

1|i know it already opened in december , but i finally got around to seeing rushmore last weekend , and it was one of those rare oppritunites that i got to leave the theatre feeling proud about paying the expensive ticket price .  as the final scene closed out in happy slow-mo fashion , i felt happy to have been priveleged enough to watch such a good display of filmmaking .  jason schwartzman , his face oddly intriguing behind those large braces and glasses , steals the show as max fischer , the most well known rushmore academy student who gets terrible grades , but compensates for it by organizing most of the school's clubs and organizations ( i . e .  the fencing team and writing and producing school plays ) and often pulling outrageous stunts , one that eventually earns him an expulsion .  this stunt , building an aquarium on the school's baseball diamond , is a plot to steal the heart of widowed elementary teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) .  he funds this aquarium with the help of millionare herman blume ( a very oscarworthy bill murray ) , who eventually finds himself falling in love with miss cross .  rosemary and herman begin dating-and the fun begins ; herman and max go at it head to head in a battle for miss cross .  herman manages to destroy max's bike , while max cuts herman's brakes , and it goes on like this .  but eventually max realizes he is too young for miss cross , and he can't stand in the way of two people in love .  the academy of arts & sciences really messed up this year ; they completely overlooked rushmore ( and , if you ask me , it wasn't an accident ) .  it maybe wasn't best picture material , but it certainly deserved a screenplay nod ( instead of elizabeth ) , and bill murray's absense from the ballot is a complete snub .  the entire mood of the film is one reason it is so good ; at one point it's fun , and the next scene can turn serious and dramatic .  the cinematography gives the movie an important feeling , as well .  i hope rushmore can overcome its' oscar snubs , and be enjoyed by intelligent film goers .  |0.7736666666666666|0.9166666666666666|0.9333333333333332|"The analysis of ""Rushmore"" is highly positive, with praise for the acting performances, mood, cinematography, and hope for recognition at the Oscars.

1|"capsule : this is a film that avoids easy answers .  wilhelm furtwangler , then the world's greatest orchestra conductor stayed in germany and cooperated with the nazis .  what were his views , was he a war criminal or a secret resistance fighter ?  how much did he know about crimes against humanity ?  the us government investigated him after the war and this film is a dramatization of that investigation .   , high +2 ( -4 to +4 )  in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo's sunshine , a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes , hungarian aristocrats , nazis , and communists .  szabo's follow-up film , a german production , is much more limited in scope .  it is about the post-war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them .  ronald harwood's screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich .  maj . steve arnold ( played by harvey keitel ) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler ( stellan skarsgard ) , perhaps europe's greatest classical music conductor .  when other artists fled germany , furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen .  after the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes .  he secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty .  from there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra .  as he interviews members of the wartime orchestra arnold starts noticing odd peculiarities that may or may not point to a conspiracy against his investigation .  there is a certain sameness to the responses that he is getting .  perhaps any cooperation he is getting has been in some ways managed .  if so , perhaps he can never come to the truth .  in large part the film is about mind games that arnold uses to manipulate his interviewees and especially furtwangler .  where the script has problems is that in the end it is so ambiguous .  it has no obvious resolution and not much of a final act .  when it is over whether anything has been established is open to interpretation .  perhaps that is better than so many films that make it all to obvious what the audience should believe , but it is like watching a murder mystery and never finding out who the killer is .  we are given clues to something but they are never tied up .  in the end we just know more about both arnold and furtwangler .  the film is basically a stage play .  the visual is not very important .  corners are cut visually including touches like filling windows with photographs to avoid having to shoot on location .  as with a stage play , what this film centers on the dialog , and that is intriguing .  i rate the film an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a high +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .

1|" "" gattaca "" represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science-fiction films -- it's a genre picture that doesn't rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story .  the movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction .  this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they'd like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects .  those made the old-fashioned way are labeled as "" in-valids "" and confined to the lower rung of society .  vincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) is one such person , born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish-molded younger brother anton .  fed up with being second-rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space , vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation .  everyday , he watches as "" superior "" folk make his fantasy a reality .  determined to do the same , vincent meets a dna broker ( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo ) who sells fake identities to in-valids .  his counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow ( jude law ) , an ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life .  for a price and the promise of a caretaker , jerome supplies vincent with his identity , as well as blood , skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card .  because of his drastically improved status , vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca , and catches the eye of comely co-worker irene ( uma thurman ) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect , she's enamored by his flawless persona she doesn't know is a lie .  but on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure , the mission director is murdered .  two ardent detectives ( alan arkin and billy bathgate's loren dean ) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca , and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of vincent's eyelashes -- threatens to blow vincent's cover and derail his goal .  even if "" gattaca "" were dramatically empty , it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials -- the film's look is dazzling without ever being flashy .  first-time director/writer andrew niccol ( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama "" the truman show "" ) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish ; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak , production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy , retro ambiance .  an opening credits sequence -- where skin , nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily .  niccol even utilizes voice-over narration ( a device almost always poorly-employed ) in an effective way .  when it comes to acting , the movie is also flawless .  ethan hawke does magnificent work , proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level .  his chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side , but needfully so , adding to the setting's clinical chill .  as the bitter jerome , jude law has a star-making presence , and it's his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core .  in "" gattaca "" 's series of final shots , the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other , and the effect is sad , lyrical and beautiful .  things get a little strange as the movie nears its climax , when vincent's relationship with his brother comes back into view .  the big dramatic culmination is a swim race , which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed .  still , the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop -- it's successful sci-fi without showy special effects , it's a crisp thriller with character-driven thrills , it's a futuristic fable without blood and guts .  even its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot , ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage .  although it's portrayal of the upcoming century is grim , "" gattaca "" serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film .

1|"available in an all new video edition from arrow entertainment ( $29 . 95 ) , with an introduction by david carradine , written & produced by wayne j . keeley  f . w . murnau's career ended sadly and prematurely .  the german director of such classics as "" sunrise "" and "" the last laugh "" died in a car accident shortly after signing a deal to make american pictures at paramount .  murnau was reportedly a giant man , well over six feet , a towering figure probably incapable of anything but a grand entrance .  which brings us to "" nosferatu : a symphony of horror "" : surely he felt a kinship with his title character , the looming vampire embodied by intimidating max schreck ; in one of the most indelible images in film history , silent or otherwise , schreck rises from his grave , gnarled hands outstretched , and he's so big that part of his head is cropped by the top of the frame .  the plot of "" nosferatu . . . ""  is lifted--unauthorized--from bram stoker's "" dracula "" .  the british hutter is an eager real estate man assigned to visit and discuss future living arrangements with count orlock of transylvania .  he leaves behind girlfriend emily , only to discover orlock's secret--he's a bloodsucker--and struggle to return to england before the nosferatu reaches his lady love .  in addition to schreck's performance , the cinematography and effects are outstanding .  arrow video's digitally remastered version of the classic is something of a mixed-coffin .  the cover art features a red-tinted , hairy , goateed vampire staring straight at you , his fanged mouth agape , while the bodies of two sexy , writhing women entice you below .  trouble is , murnau's monster is pale-faced , bald , pointy-eared , and non-goateed , and there isn't a single sexy , writhing woman to be found in his movie .  this sort of misleading packaging makes little sense when one recalls the countless number of ghouslish scenes in the film from which cool cover art could have been extracted .  additionally , notifying the viewer that this is in fact murnau's film seems like afterthought since his name and the genuine title are written in small print below our goateed vampire .  that said , a good mastering job has been performed on the film itself .  the original elements are not in the best condition--non-studio silents were unlucky in their preservation-- so we're still dealing with a slightly washed out , scratched , jittering image .  but at least the day and night scenes are tinted sepia and blue , respectively , especially helpful to an audience who may question nosferatu's waltzing around during what seems like sunlight ( it took a lot of light to expose stock in the twenties ) .  the title cards have been redone , and they are legible , accurate , and digitally altered to flicker--a very nice touch .   ( even the opening copyright warning flickers ! )  the score has been replaced by music from type o negative , a hard-rock group , arguably gothic , and their songs underscore the film nicely-- certainly the coolest video a band can ask for .  when our hero , hutter , first steps onto the doomed carriage to count orlock's castle , we hear a well-timed "" now you're dead ! ""  from lead singer peter steele .  david carradine makes an appropriately vampiric host ; he fiddles with a blade and cane while introducing the film .  after the feature , which runs about 63 minutes , is included a new music video from type o negative , the black-and-white fang-fest "" black no . 1 "" .  of course , "" nosferatu : a symphony of horror "" is the main attraction , and while my latest viewing raised questions ( why is the woman called emily in the title cards but "" mina "" --as bram stoker called her--in hutter's letters ? , for instance ) , it made me realize how much this movie has inspired and been stolen from .  coppola's 1992 "" bram stoker's dracula "" owes a great stylistic debt to murnau's masterpiece , but the one thing it couldn't thieve was the original's abstract charms .  this latest incarnation from arrow will probably- -like the rescored "" metropolis "" a few years back--turn a silent film into more palpable entertainment for the latest generation of film freaks .

1|"when i left the theater after seeing david lynch's "" lost highway , "" i remarked to a fellow movie-goer , "" i feel like someone just sucked my brains out through my nose and put them back in through my ears . ""  in his first feature film in five years , lynch delivers a film second only to his debut picture "" eraserhead "" on the weirdness scale .  you won't "" know "" what happened when it's over , though there are certainly enough clues with which to make some reasonable guesses .  it is difficult to describe the plot of this film , because it depends partly on how you interpret it .  i can , however , describe what we see on the screen : l . a . jazz saxophonist fred madison ( bill pullman ) and his wife renee ( patricia arquette ) , whom he clearly suspects of infidelity , receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep .  they are , naturally enough , more than a little frightened and confused , and it doesn't help matters any when "" mystery man "" ( robert blake ) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving .  the next morning , fred finds another videotape which , to his ( and our ) surprise , shows him brutally murdering renee in their bedroom .  he is convicted of her murder and sent to death row , where he inexplicably disappears one night and is replaced by a young mechanic named pete dayton ( balthazar getty ) .  the perplexed prison officials release dayton , whose life begins to intersect with fred in a number of ways - most notably his affair with alice wakefield ( arquette again ) , a blonde who is otherwise renee's spitting image , and another encounter with the mystery man .  i would be giving away a little too much to reveal any more , but suffice it to say that lynch doesn't offer any neat wrap ? ups , nor does he put a lid on the metaphysical confusion : the cinematic demons of "" lost highway "" are out in full force from beginning to end .  this description might make "" lost highway "" sound like a giddy exercise in haywire surrealism , but in fact , while there are traces of lynch's weird sense of humor , this film is anything but giddy most of the time .  on the contrary , lost highway is a dark and perplexing mystery that takes lynch's previous excursions into murder and intrigue one step farther .  the film does not revolve around a character investigating a mystery ; rather , the character * is * the mystery .  there are recurring and at times deeply disturbing images of suspicion , distrust , and infidelity thoughout the film that seem to indicate a deluded , fractured psyche at the root of all the bizarre goings-on here .  we , the audience , are left to puzzle out whose psyche it is that is driving this ( probably fred's , in my opinion ) and what , in that case , the other characters and events are meant to represent .  all of this proceeds , appropriately , in lynch's typically slow-paced , idiosyncratic style .  as is often the case , lynch relies on sound , imagery , and mood more than on dialogue and action to tell his story , and in "" lost highway "" it works perfectly .  there are scenes when the camera lingers on fred's blank expression as he drifts uncomfortably down a hallway , or on his pained face in his prison cell while the haunting strains of this mortal coil's "" song to the siren "" can be heard faintly in the background ; nothing is technically "" happening "" in these scenes , yet they present a vivid picture of a man losing his grip just as effective as , if not more so than , the hysterical screaming found in most movie presentations of insanity .  lynch's direction and director of photography pete deming's darkly lit cinematography serve to create a nearly suffocating atmosphere of tension and fear that are exactly what is needed for this story .  well , most of the time , anyway - i have to admit that i was a bit bored at times during the section of the film with pete dayton as the protgaonist , which is less inherently interesting and mostly keeps the viewer's attention because of its tie-ins to the original mystery .  the main characters in this "" reality "" - dayton ( a well-meaning but none too intelligent 24-year-old ) , a sleazy gangster ( who for some reason has two names but otherwise is pretty much a stock character ) , and his porn-star girlfriend ( the blond arquette ) - are nothing you couldn't find in any of the two dozen "" pulp fiction "" wannabes ; fortunately , the reappearance of the mystery man as well as some other typically lynchian elements , such as the strained , awkward conversations between pete and his parents , help to preserve the film's spooky , unnerving tone during this stretch .  lynch's typically graphic and disturbing portrayals of fringe sexuality , while relevant to the themes of jealousy and adultery , are also somewhat overdone here .  it's not exactly exploitative - like almost everything else in this film , the sex is thoroughly weird and creepy and is unlikely to provide any cheap lurid thrills - as much as it is unnecessary and frankly kind of dumb by the seventh or eighth time arquette takes her clothes off .  that said , these minor flaws don't prevent "" lost highway "" from attaining its place as one of the darkest , most unsettling films to hit the screens in recent years .  it is a one-way ride down the lost highway of a disturbed mind , and as such it is gripping , intense , and brilliantly effective .

1|"i'm not really sure what to think about "" crash . ""  on the surface , it's a cold , boring , unerotic porn with name starts , a name director , and some cool camerawork .  i mean , it left me completely bored , unsatisfied , and generally kinda weirded out .  but then again , not every film's supposed to leave you entertained .   "" crash "" is structured to play like a porn flick , but with significantly more plot and dialogue .  while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex , we also have a skimpy little plot going on ( mostly towards the beginning ) , and maybe just a hair of characterization .  not to mention the acting is generally pretty good , and we don't really see a lot of the actors completely exposed .  but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience .  this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of "" henry and june "" or the just plain horniness of , say , "" deep throat "" ( not that i've seen it ) .  if one was to be made completely hot by this film , it would probably mean they were also into the whole "" auto eroticism "" thing .  the film leaves you cold erotically ( and maybe in many other ways ) , but what it does is present a group of people who live on the edge .  the film opens up on a woman , catherine ( deborah kara ungar , of "" the game "" ) , pressing her bare breast up against a car in a public air hangar .  suddenly , a man enters the frame and begins to take her from behind ( the film doesnt' show all this though , even if it is nc-17 ) .  the next scene has a film director , james ( james spader ) , having sex with a camera woman ( alice poon ) in an office on the highly-populated set of his movie .  the next scene has the two coming together , revealing to us that they're husband and wife , and them sharing in one another's escapades .  while the two are arguably freaky people , we at least know they love to live on the edge .  soon afterwards , james is driving down the road at night , reclessly of course ( he's reading something ) , when he drifts into the other lane , and then hits another car face on .  james is not killed , but the passenger in the other car flies into his seat ( obviously dying ) , leaving the driver , helen remington ( holly hunter - in a porn ? ) , also alive .  the two go through therapy together , and when getting out , they run into eachother again .  when james gives her a ride home , they almost get into another accident , and immeadiately afterwards , they go to an unbusy parking lot , and have a little quickie , as they were aroused by the accident .  you wouldn't think there would be many people who shared this same kind of fetish , but they run into a freaky guy named vaughan ( elias kosteas ) and his crutch-carrying girlfriend , gabrielle ( rosanna arquette ) , who are also into it .  vaughan is into living on the edge as they are , but he takes it to another level : he loves to recreate famous car crashes .  in one scene , he and a friend , colin seagrave ( peter macneill ) recreate james dean's car crash without any padding or safety belts , and suffer some concussions , but nevertheless get a rush ( and the attention of the police ) .  soon , these five are all having sex with one another , be it straight , gay , or lesbian sex .  while this is admittingly all a bit comical ( the film is almost like a black comedy ) , the film does do a pretty awesome portrayal of people who's main fetish is living on the edge .  i'm sure somewhere there are people who get aroused by car accidents , but i personally don't see a connection between car crashes and sex .  the main connection cronenberg shows us that both give a definite rush .  his car crash scenes are quick and exciting mini-masterpieces : we're at first not sure if they'll take place , but everytime it looks like it may occur , we gasp .  then when it happens , we hold our breath .  the same thing happens with sex , although not in the same fashion .  these people are merely taking it to another level .  the only problem with the film is that it's a tad redundant .  a normal porn lasts from an hour to an hour and a half .  this goes on for about 100 minutes , and it just seems a little too long .  the sex and car crashes are far between one another , and the time between them are a tad on the boring side .  there's no characterization , although it could definitely be argued , that hey , it's a porn , and we're not here to sympathize .  but still , they coulda cut it down a bit .  but the film is saved with its presentation , as well as some other elements .  the atmosphere is very dark and forboding , creating a kind of cool weird feeling .  and there are several scenes are just amazing .  one scene has catherine and james having sex , while she softly asks him questions about being with a man , which sounds almost erotic the way she says it .  a sequence involving one character's death is filled with all the edgy disjointment that the film needs .  and the final shot is shot perfectly , creating an image of a car crash , and a couple having sex in front of it , despite the fact that she's wounded .  the acting is also pretty good , especially for what is almost a porn ( ousting linda lovelace as best actress in a porn ) .  while james spader is pretty boring ( he's usually pretty intense ) , deborah kara ungar is amazing .  she speaks all her words in almost zombie-like hushes , and when she's having sex , she has a blank look on her face , not showing the viewer whether she's enjoying it or not .  in one scene , she actually looks dead while someone is having sex with her .  holly hunter , who gets extra credit just for appearing in something like this , is pretty good , and so is rosanna arquette ( who adds a kinda cool kinkiness to her role ) .  but the film is stolen by elias kosteas who plays his character so intensely that he almost upstages everyone .  he often speaks as he is out of breath , showing a definite affinity for his way of life .  he has a great deal of energy in several scenes , especially one scene where he's taking photographs of a picture , and a later scene where he's getting a freaky tatoo .  he and spader share sexual chemistry in several scenes , foreshadowing a later scene .  kosteas is a little known actor ( his biggest role was casey jones in "" teenage mutant ninja turtles "" ) , but here he shows a deniro-like presence , hinting that he's capable of bigger roles .  while i hardly enjoyed "" crash , "" it's still a pretty intriguing portrayal of a group of people who , if the exist , are some of the strangest and most bizarre people in the world .  these people are able to share a rush between two completely different entities , and the film , which doesn't exactly pain them in a negative light , is sucessful in bringing them to light , even if it leaves the viewer unnerved and generally freaked out .  despite the hardcore nature of the film and the subsequent nc-17 rating ( there's also an r-rated version , but i wouldn't even go near that thing ) , anyone looking for a quick turn-on should just rent a regular porno .

1|the first thing you notice about this movie is that it's cold .  placed in minnesota and north dakota during the winter , many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow-covered ground against a background of white .  just what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night .  as with most coen brothers films , this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes , each of which works out in the oddest way possible .  a car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father .  along the way everything that can possibly go wrong does .  in brief scenes of vicious violence , people get shot through the head , in the back , face , chest and various other areas of the anatomy .  there is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen .  remarkably enough , most of the movie is played for laughs .  even more remarkably , it works .  the only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff ( frances mcdormand ) who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity .  with every good film the audience gains new knowledge .  here you learn _two_ things .  everyone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy .  and don't do violent illegal business with low-life amoral degenerate scum-sucking losers .  oh yeah , if you get shot in the face , using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy .  |-0.19999999999999996|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|The general sentiment of the text leans slightly towards the negative side, as indicated by descriptions of coldness, violence, and unpleasant scenes.

( pun intended ) it's a moving picture with great performances , no shakespearian speak ( thank you , god ! ) and an outstanding directorial job by nelson .  the final scene alone is enough to send a massive chill down your spine , and i was especially impressed with the director's choice of music near the end .  in fact , the whole sequence was quite reminiscent of the final showdown scene from taxi driver , and i guess that's saying something right there .  where's joblo coming from ?  10 things i hate about you ( 7/10 ) - election ( 7/10 ) - hamlet ( 6/10 ) - love's labor's lost ( 8/10 ) - natural born killers ( 9/10 ) - save the last dance ( 7/10 ) - shakespeare in love ( 5/10 )  "|0.5|0.8166666666666668|0.8333333333333334|The text indicates that there is a mix of positive and negative sentiments regarding the movie.

1|"jake kasdan , son of one of the best screenwriters around , breaks into filmmaking by writing and directing this hard-to-categorize detective story : part mystery , part comedy , part character study and part romance .  for the most part , kasdan manages to combine the genres successfully and create a captivating film .  daryl zero ( bill pullman ) is a modern day sherlock holmes .  the parallel is present down to his love of music ( though zero plays the guitar rather than the violin ) , and his addiction to drugs ( amphetamines , rather than morphine ) .  he even titles his cases with such sherlockian epigrams as the case of the mismatched shoelaces , the case about the man who lied about his age , or the case of the hired gun who made way way too many mistakes .  however zero's observance of the fine art of detachment , though it makes him a brilliant private investigator , makes him somewhat of a self-imposed outcast in society .  he could do nothing without the legwork of his trusty assistant dr . watson , i mean steve arlo ( ben stiller ) .  arlo is not happy with his job .  he is thrilled to be around zero's brilliance , but his bizarre behavior , and strange requests , are frustrating to the former lawyer .  and they're even more so to his girlfriend , jess ( angela featherstone ) , who is fed up that her boyfriend's boss means more to arlo than her .  this is the situation when a new case comes knocking .  gregory stark ( ryan o'neill ) hires zero to find his lost keys .  it seems that he kept a safety deposit box key on the ring , and the box apparently contains some incriminating evidence .  now , stark is being blackmailed , and needs to reclaim his key before the nightmare can end .  to solve this case , zero reluctantly crawls out of his shell .  however , this is when he is vulnerable . . . and  this time he falls for charms of a wily paramedic , gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) , who may be involved in the blackmail scheme .  for the first time , zero has to question his own objectivity , as he finds his client less and less sympathetic .  zero effect is weakest in its obviously "" wacky "" scenes depicting daryl zero's odd behavior .  such scenes might be appropriate in an out-and-out satire , making zero an ace ventura-ish character .  however , there's a much meatier movie in here . . . it just takes a while to get out .  that's not to say that there's not a place for humor in this film .  in fact , some of the best scenes are ben stiller's wonderfully underplayed comic moments of absolute disgust and frustration with his employer .  however , the over-the-top scenes never quite gel with the rest of the film , and they aren't funny enough to stand on their own .  once the investigation is underway , however , zero's brilliance really begins to shine .  his lightning quick inferences are as fascinating as many of sherlock's own .  as the mystery begins to unfold , zero's deductions lead the plot in interesting directions , but never lose the viewer .  zero effect works well during its romantic scenes as well .  zero's relationship with gloria is low-key , but it hits all the right notes .  however , we are always kept distant from gloria's character .  she's given plenty of development , but we never understand what she is thinking .  perhaps that may be intentional : to place the audience in zero's zone of detachment .  but , on the whole , it is frustrating .  bill pullman , when he's not spacing out , creates a vibrant character in daryl zero .  there's one moment when zero briefly connects to the world which he has managed to detach from for many years , and it is shockingly moving . . . expressing a seriousness that heretofore was unassociated with the character , but one which fits in well .  and , although it is sometimes hard to take a detective called "" zero "" seriously , it is at this moment that the viewer understands the meaning behind the name .  although zero effect is a bit awkward in places , it is a strong debut for kasdan , and shows great promise .

1|well i'll be damned , what a most excellent surprise .  not to be confused with the campy and far inferior 1988 remake starring ex-porn star traci lords , this more recent attempt at remaking the 1950's drive-in schlockfest not of this earth is a real gem and was quite possibly the best sci-fi flick of 1995 .  once again , b-movie king roger corman is behind this effort ( he directed the original ) but this time he appears only in the role of executive producer .  the rest of the crew and cast are relative unknowns .  it seems criminal that the film was released direct to video in most countries , because it's an absolute must-see for sci-fi fans and a treat for anyone who enjoys decently acted and written thrillers with a kooky bent .  the plot in brief .  paul johnson ( michael york ) is an alien posing as an eccentric millionaire who , though needing to kill people to live , is visiting earth for far from selfish reasons .  his race is dying of a mysterious blood disease and he desperately is trying to find a cure , the key of which lies in the blood of humans .  he visits and soon puts under his spell the respected blood physician dr . rochelle , whom he hypnotises into doing secret research on his behalf .  he also has the doctor convince smart and sexy nurse amanda ( elizabeth barondes ) to move in with johnson as his private nurse so as to give him the blood transfusions which he constantly requires .  but before long , amanda and johnson's sleazy chauffeur release that johnson is a lot more than just eccentric .  i must admit , my first glimpse of the video cover for not of this earth was not encouraging .  british actor michael york has appeared in some real stinkers in past few decades , a far cry from the quality fare of his younger days such as caberat ( 1972 ) .  but his performance here as an alien in human disguise is nothing short of outstanding .  the weird twitches and bizarre modes of speech , the dapper clothes and cool spectacles , the unexpected pathos which he invests in his character .  york is by turns hilarious , menacing and tragic .  this is a tour-de-force and quite simply the best performance i've seen from him .  and while obviously made on a modest budget , the film boasts enormous strengths .  the casting is spot on , the acting is terrific and the script is intelligent , witty and consistently engaging , cleverly updating the original .  the balance of horror and humour is just about perfect , a marked contrast to the earlier remake from 1988 .  the film doesn't drag for a second of its 90 minute running time thanks to tight editing and the sure hand of little-known director terrance h . winkless .  and it doesn't matter one bit that the special effects are cheesy - this is schlock after all , even if it is high class schlock .  in fact my only criticism of the film is that things get a tad weak towards the end .  tighter direction could have given the climax more urgency and a few of the characters act rather illogically given their life-threatening situation .  but these are minor complaints .  just see it .  not of this earth is one of the biggest sci-fi surprises in years .  and michael york : in one cool swoop you've made yourself a b-movie legend , dude .  |0.7532333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.7999999999999999|The sentiment of the text is overwhelmingly positive, with praise for the actor's performance, intelligent script, spot-on casting, and overall enjoyment of the film.

1|"in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural "" rush hour "" - to the tune of about $250 million .  you don't mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in "" rush hour 2 . ""  the combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in "" rush hour "" that played well to audiences around the world .  the formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable .  i'm never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations .  surprisingly , "" rush hour 2 "" wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it .  the script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start .  terrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime .  concurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights .  instead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars .  the makers of "" rush hour 2 "" are working at a distinct advantage over the original .  we , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around .  that chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit .  little time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in "" rush hour . ""  first and foremost to me , in "" rh2 , "" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan's artistry in fight choreography .  the 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint .  chan's use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket .  his moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino .  like harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch .  chris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys .  when he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun .  when lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff .  the comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills .  the combo of chan's flying feet and fists with tucker's fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the "" lethal weapon "" films .  the supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently .  john lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) .  lone doesn't chew scenery or make pronouncements to "" get lee and carter , "" but gives the chief bad guy elegance .  zhang zi-yi ( "" crouching tiger , hidden dragon "" ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky's taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter .   ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion . )  roselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she doesn't add much to the equation but is terrific to watch .  director ratner and the original "" rush hour "" production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera .  cinematographer matthew f . leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives "" rh2 "" the fluid camera movement the genre film needs .  production design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino .  the rest of the techs are of the same high quality .  i'm surprised to even say that "" rush hour 2 "" is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies .  it takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer .  i give it a b .

1|"shakespeare . you hardly understood it in high school .  why would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn't count on it ?  if this is your attitude , then i'll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh's hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now .  if , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark .  namely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king's brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play .  his suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother's hands .  hamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery . . . . and  the game is afoot . . . .  the first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes .  with external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established .  interior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers .  the hamlet castle's grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft .  costuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination . .  not quite the denmark of the 1600's , the characters' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel .  it is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively .  in addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character .  as the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows .  from the anticipation of seeing his father's ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades .  every scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh's acting and directing as to shakespeare's manuscript .  hamlet seems to be a who's who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself .  julie christie , as hamlet's mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players .  kate winslet as hamlet's lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character's plummet to the depths of dispair and madness .  richard briers as ophelia's father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing .  nicholas farrell as hamlet's trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two-timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast .  hamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible .  in some cases , this made for interesting scenes .  billy crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well .  crystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene .  however , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all .  as the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba .  part of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time .  his off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor .  i wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention .  unfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions .  jack lemmon , an excellent actor , just can't do shakespeare .  as marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet's ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him .  gerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of "" yes , my lord "" and "" no , my lord "" in the role of reynaldo .  richard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk-on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador .  i think he had two lines .  then there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway .  when i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was .  if bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you .  hamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one .  branagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback-type images .  this only works about half the time , and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them .  you don't have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare , but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly .  the alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar , the high school english course .  in it , you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king's english .  or i suppose you could just read the cliff notes .
