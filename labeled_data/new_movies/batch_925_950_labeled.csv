1|"contact is a film that tries to do several different things .  it is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) .  the film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals .  the portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv's the x-files .  the aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else .  they know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person .  the film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick's 2001 : a space odyssey .  most of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens .  scientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between .  the debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway's atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind's representative to another species .  the film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed .  still , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society .  the two "" sides "" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists .  palmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology .  then again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions .  contact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself .  the film's one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss .  for one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction .  the romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss's explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( "" i guess you could say i'm a man of the cloth , but without the cloth "" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development .  instead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments .  granted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers' part more than anything else .  the successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures .  even if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn't ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film .  contact doesn't quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable .  and i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction .

1|billy bob thornton , who had a sudden rise to fame with 1996's sling blade after spending years as a virtually unknown actor and writer , is becoming one of the most versatile - and most accomplished - american actors around at the moment .  as jacob , the simple but at times very bright loser brother of bill paxton's hank , thornton gives a performance which should leave an indelible mark on all but the most hardened viewers .  three men , hank ( paxton ) , jacob ( thornton ) and their friend lou ( brent briscoe ) stumble upon a plane wreck which , upon closer inspection , yields a rotting corpse and a bag full of money .  jacob and lou want to pocket the cash .  hank , the smarter - and perhaps more naive - of the three , insists on leaving the money for the authorities to find .  eventually , they agree to keep the cash safe until the plane is found , and then split the money three ways .  things start going wrong , though , with greed and violence weaving their ways through their plan .  disaster is sure to strike .  director sam raimi , of the evil dead and darkman fame , has made an excellent and thought-provoking film , worlds away from the comic horror films which made his name .  while there are a couple of moments which might remind one of his earlier work , raimi has made an intelligent and mature departure which will hopefully be a sign of even greater films to come .  scott b . smith's screenplay , based on his novel ( which i haven't read ) is a fine example of escalating tension .  while it does remind one of danny boyle's shallow grave without the abundance of black humour , it keeps the drama that should really be a part of such a story on morality , or the lack thereof , found in a film with this subject matter .  alar kivilo's cinematography reminds one of joel and ethan coen's fargo , with the bleak , snowy landscape almost becoming another character .  danny elfman also does well with his moody , finely-written score .  if there's a flaw in the film , it's that it goes on for just a little too long .  just when we think that they are about to wrap things up , raimi and smith decide to let the film go on a little further .  while this isn't really a bad thing , it did become a little frustrating at times ( this may have been due to the fact that i had consumed a large sprite beforehand ) .  the performances are excellent , with the usually annoying paxton in fine form and bridget fonda giving a scene-stealing turn as hank's scheming wife .  this is an excellent showcase for thornton's fine skills as an actor and a great change in direction for raimi , who could very well have a career ahead of him as an accomplished director of dramatic films .  fingers crossed , though , that this doesn't stop him from making another evil dead sequel .  |0.6533333333333333|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|The explanations highlight the positive aspects of the film, including the performances, directing style, screenplay, and cinematography.

1|"tibet has entered the american consciousness slowly during the past few years and burst into the forefront recently .  the dalai lama has made speaking tours , tibetan designs and artifacts are showing up in shops , the plight of the people has captured the imagination of major actors and artists and now there are two big budget films within as many months .   "" kundun "" ( "" presence "" , a name the monks call the young dalai lama ) opens in 1937 with the search for the 14th incarnation of the tibetan leader .  a group of monks enters a village and a two-year-old child catches their attention .  the young boy proves himself by identifying possessions of the previous holy man as "" mine "" .  he and his family are then moved to a monastery in lhassa where he is to be prepared to take his position as the religious and political leader of the country .  he is forced into difficult decisions when china invades the country in 1950 .  the peaceful and isolated country is ill-equipped to fight off the intruders and diplomatic attempts over the next years yield no results .  eventually he must make the painful choice to flee to neighboring india .  comparisons to "" seven years in tibet "" are inevitable .  both films cover much of the same ground although the earlier movie does so from a westerner's point of view and features boxoffice draw brad pitt .   "" kundun "" features only native actors and is more of an insider's story .  in some ways , this makes this film a superior concept , but it lacks the movement and spark that made "" seven years "" such an audience-pleaser .  the actors contribute to the realistic feel of the movie ( filmed in morocco for obvious reasons ) .  the only disappointment is chairman mao who looks like a wax dummy and moves as if he were a computer-generated character .  on an intellectual level , it is interesting to see how two different approaches handle the same facts .  some events are depicted differently and pitt's austrian mountain-climber who was portrayed as a pivotal influence in the dalai lama's life isn't even mentioned here .  glossed over in "" seven years "" , the problems with the tibetan political system is hinted at here as the dalai lama muses "" we were just about to change things "" after the chinese attack .  the film is magnificently beautiful thanks primarily to the cinematography of roger deakins .  his lingering camera shows the exotic tibetan culture with luscious detail .  especially striking is an extreme moving close up of a sand mandala grain by grain .  the visual treats more than make up for the movie's faults creating a poetic meditation for the audience .  walking out of the theater you feel like you have awakened from a transcendental experience .  martin scorsese , known for his dark tales of the underworld ( "" goodfellas "" , "" taxi driver "" , "" casino "" ) has shifted gears .  something of a thematic follow-up to his "" the last temptation of christ "" , this is his slowest film yet .  oddly enough for a director with a history of graphic violence presenting a history filled with atrocities by the chinese , most of these events take place off-screen .  his decision to not over-explain rituals is commendable .  the stumbling oracle who spits out his prophecies while in a trance state is much more effective as a mystery than if we were spoon-fed interpretations .  philip glass's score is impressive although at times it is too overwhelming and distracting .  i talked to a tibetan i met outside the theater who had just seen the film and was walking back in to see it again .  hearing his description of how he escaped from tibet at the age of seven and how his father was one of the soldiers accompanying the dalai lama during his trip to india , i was struck by what was missing in the movie .  as grand as it looks and as historically accurate as it is , there is a distance between the audience and the movie .  the film is more concerned with visuals and history and less so with human beings .  with the exception of a few scenes , involvement with the characters is slight .  one of those exceptions is the portrayal of the young dalai lama , shown as a mischievous boy who can't resist being a kid sometimes .  an encounter with his older brother thubten j . norbu ( a retired indiana university professor ) who tells the young leader the chinese have ordered him to persuade him to accept communist rule or kill him is an outstanding moment , but there aren't many of these .  even with its problems , the "" kundun "" experience is phenomenal , but one that i fear most will miss .  many people who saw "" seven years in tibet "" will have a "" been there , done that "" attitude .  it's likely that the film will miss a wide-spread appeal and public response will be the sound of one hand clapping .

1|"i swear i have seen the edge before .  in fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film .  however , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot .  in doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker .  unfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film .  but leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head .  one surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script .  action films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence .  even horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all .  the river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s .  the intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day .  the edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall .  i must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes .  this is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) .  if only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) .  the edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film .  but taking scream's lead , the edge makes fun of the genre's cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) .  charles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him .  for once , we don't immediately care for the main character .  instead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness .  they board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic .  charles' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob .  as action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect .  soon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his "" personality . ""  charles , bob , bob's assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter .  down the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness .  director lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations .  he succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film .  take , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot .  this has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears .  but given the charles' intelligence , and bob's uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists .  even charles himself seems to have seen these action films before .  my favorite line of the film comes from charles : "" most people die in the wilderness because they didn't do the one thing that could save their life . . .  thinking . ""  despite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn't as it seems anymore .  i have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely .  the first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice .  tamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility .  i have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water .  why not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ?  i guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while .  thankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide .  but some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) .  the acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal .  anthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day .  hopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs .  alec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) .  baldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way .  you can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer .  elle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight .  she isn't in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model .  harold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed .  he is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable .  the edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language .  some of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me .  this film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down .  director tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts .  david mamet's script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid .  the best thing about the script is the ending which doesn't end with the normal high-strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift .  it's a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear .  and by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear .  way to go , bart .

1|"one of the more unusual and suggestively violent films ever made , "" se7en "" is just a few steps away from brilliance .  however , those few steps away are only a few steps from a level of evil and depravity that few people want to discuss .  the film received mixed reviews upon release , but there's an underlying sinister appeal and intrigue to this that many critics perhaps did not notice .  at times it gets preachy about the horrors it seems to be criticizing , but the script and the ultimate pay-off are excellent .  the shocking conclusion is just as unpredictable as the endings of most films are predictable .  this piece of work is 100% intensity .  it's uncomfortable to watch , yet compelling .   "" i want not to look , yet i cannot turn away . ""  the story creeps along slowly and deliberately , crafted by visionary director david fincher .  he has experience in tantalizing his audience with information and visions , but not giving away too much too soon .  this is the guy who directed the ominous "" alien 3 "" .   "" se7en "" is even more ominous because the threat is real .  it's human and , while the script takes some artistic licence , the way in which the diabolical killer works here is actually realistic .  that is , if a human being could be so intelligent , patient , wealthy , and disillusioned .  after the most bizarre opening credits i've ever seen ( refreshingly different in editing style and musical accompaniment ) , the initial character development takes place .  morgan freeman stars as detective william somerset , a knowledgeable veteran who is ready to give up on his job and the sickness of society .  brad pitt co-stars as detective david mills , the young hotshot who is brand new to this unnamed city and full of fury to catch the bad guys .  these two fine actors give the film its human qualities ( along with the appealing gwyneth paltrow , who plays tracy , mills' wife ) .  however , none of them stands out above the material .  no disrespect intended , but two other actors could have played these parts and the film probably would have been about the same .  an ironic note is that somerset has only a week ( or 7 , that's seven , days ) left on the force to train his young protege .  the title of the picture also refers to the 7 deadly sins , as chronicled by john milton in "" paradise lost "" --gluttony , greed , sloth , lust , pride , envy , & wrath .  incidentally , i wrote the sins in order of how each victim was found .  it's the last two sins that are the most intriguing and shocking , but i won't give that away .  as i said , this has a great ending and no one should spoil it .  anyway , the brilliant killer sets out to make a statement to the world that these sins will no longer be tolerated and he makes the "" sinners "" suffer for it .  the two partners stumble over the corpse of a grotesquely obese man .  they learn that he was murdered--forced to eat himself to death .  the killer leaves small clues at this and other murders and , of course , somerset and mills are smart enough to stay with him all the way .  if they didn't , it would be one short movie !  the deliberate pace allows for craftsmanship of detail and story .  we see a lot of blood , but it's not especially violent .  the suggestion of what happens is far more disgusting than anything actually shown--like most of the violence in "" pulp fiction "" .   "" se7en "" is gory , graphic , and disturbing , but all the gore is post-death .  still , if you tend to get queasy , don't eat food during this film .  kevin spacey plays john doe , the avenging angel who claims that he's the messenger who will right the wrongs with his teachings .  like many crazy men , he has some fine ideas , but some sick ways of expressing himself .  spacey doesn't appear until the final 30 minutes and also doesn't receive billing in the opening credits .  however , it's his appearance that turns this film upside down and for that he should have gotten an oscar nomination .  a great villain manages to make you either root for him or feel compelled to listen to his ramblings regardless of whether you agree with him or not .  this character is so well written that it's hard to disagree when he says that what he is doing will be remembered by everyone .  no serial killer has ever been so creative .   "" se7en "" is blatantly unsubtle with its messages about the horrors of the world and it's often a little too depressing .  what it lacks in those areas , it makes up for with believable dialogue , top-notch screenwriting , unexpected twists , and realistic characters .  the technical aspects of the film are unobtrusive .  fincher uses lighting , music , and editing quite well , but his story is always the thrust of the film .  fortunately , we don't find out what happens to mills and somerset after the closing credits ( which are run backwards up the screen ! ) .  it's better to imagine what paths they will follow .  this is not the kind of film you turn away from and quickly forget .  it's got a sinister message and john doe is right about one thing--the evils of the world aren't going to cure themselves .   "" se7en "" raises some tough questions and it's intelligent enough to allow its audience to answer many of those questions for themselves .  useless trivia--co-stars in 1995's "" se7en "" , brad pitt and kevin spacey also competed for the 1995 best supporting actor oscar--pitt in "" 12 monkeys "" , spacey in "" the usual suspects "" ( for which he won ) .

1|"there are some works of art that are almost impossible to review , not because of their own complexity , but because of their legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original .  one of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one .  its popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day .  casablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience .  one of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time .  it was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn't been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein , philip j . epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director .  however , the movie was commercially successful and earned three "" oscars "" , including the one for the best film .  until this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age .  the plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story .  in december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government .  thousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas .  many shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains ) .  his best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of "" sticking his neck for nobody "" .  however , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas .  this event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca .  one of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe .  he is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris .  the couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail .  rick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism .  the casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status .  bogart's portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character .  another icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime .  the cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn't look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works .  for many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made .  but the reason for that isn't the romance itself - it's the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life .  the casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads .  the supporting actors also did a marvellous job .  sidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston's maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters .  another shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny .  unfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling .  however , rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca .  captain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm .  despite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary .  rains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault's relationship towards rick , and rick's final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations .  together with well-drawn characters and exciting story , the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere .  professional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies , but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable , if not realistic .  any way , even if we don't see it as a historical document , casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration .

""  isn't quite the tagging that's going to sell a movie .  it isn't too wise either to market the film using the movie's stupidest lines ( "" beam me up scotty "" - yeah , that sure is great writing . . . ) .  i mean , let's face it ; armageddon's previews rival the truman show's as being some of the worst of the year .  neither of them even come close to doing their respective films justice .  of course , you all know the story .  when the earth is threatened with total annihilation via an asteroid the size of texas , nasa calls in the us's top oil drillers ( ! ) to go into space ( ! ) and implant a nuclear device eight-hundred and someodd feet into the asteroid ( ! ) .  in the coarse of all this mayhem , we are introduced to some interesting - and not so interesting - characters .  belonging to the former group is rockhound ( steve buscemi ) , a horny little womanizing genius who's always full of wisecracks , even when flying into space at a huge amount of g's .  also , there's the always cool-as-hell billy bob thornton as dan truman , the bigwig at nasa who recruits all the drillers .  he kind of reminded me of ed harris in apollo 13 , only without the intensity and great lines to deliver .  then on the flip side of the coin is the tired , contrived character of harry stamper ( bruce willis , who does the whole movie employing with annoying accent i can't quite place ) , the leader of the pack as well as liv tyler and ben affleck as the token lovers you must have in any summer movie .  basically , that's about it .  as i said , this is hardly a film about plot .  it's another summer blockbuster with plot points that are beyond unbelievable and dialogue and characters that are mostly completely wooden .  case in point : nasa doesn't know that there is even an asteroid on it's way until eighteen days before impact - huh ?  another example : at one point in the movie , two children are playing with toy space shuttles in front of a poster of kennedy .  how pretentious is that ? ? ? ! ! !  want another one ?  okay ; before the oil drillers blast off into space , one of them starts singing "" leaving on a jet plane "" , and soon , all the rest join in .  did michael bay attend the school of sappy filmmaking before he made this picture ?  but naturally , all this sappiness , melodrama and special effects accumulate to one bitchin' time at the movies .  and don't get me wrong - despite all of the things i found wrong with armageddon , i still very much enjoyed it .  so even if you don't win one of mcdonald's free tickets , it's still definitely worth checking out .

1|"this is one of the most funny and entertaining comedies of the year and it just happens to be animated .  there are some great voice over commentaries from hollywood's most famous celebrities , some fabulous animation and a compelling story .  this is the best we've seen from disney since "" beauty and the beast "" ( 1996 ) .  this film begins an unspecified time following the happily-ever-after conclusion to toy story .  in the aftermath of their earlier adventures , buzz ( voice of tim allen ) and woody ( voice of tom hanks ) are now fast friends and all the toys live in perfect harmony , content with their "" lives "" .  one day , andy broke woody's arm off , while playing with him .  woody is now officially discarged and worthless , left with his nightmares , where he lies in a trash can with the other discards .  later andy's mother decides to have a yard sale , and she collects a few old toys from her son's room .  since one of these discards is a member of the moving toy gang , woody goes to the rescue , leaving the safety of the house for the uncertainty of the front lawn in order to bring the toy back .  although his mission is successful , he is placed in a serious predicament when a toy collector named al ( voice of wayne knight ) spies woody while hunting through the wares available at the sale .  the cowboy toy represents the final collectible needed to complete his collection of merchandise from the old tv series , "" woody's roundup . ""  if he can acquire woody , al can ship everything to a toy museum in japan for a huge profit .  so , after andy's mother refuses to sell the wooden cowboy , al steals him , and it's up to the other toys , led by buzz , to go into the city to save their friend .  and so , buzz , rex ( voice of wallace shawn ) , hamm ( voice of john ratzenberger ) , mr . potatohead ( voice of don rickles ) , and slinky ( voice of jim varney ) , go out on a dangerous journey to rescue their friend , they find themselves confronting things like busy streets and other buzz lightyear toys .  there are car chases , gun fights and finally the confrontation between buzz and his nemesis ( who , by the way , resembles darth vader ) .  meanwhile , woody learns that he was once a tv celebrity and has a family - a cowgirl named jessie ( voice of joan cusack ) , a horse named bullseye , and a father figure called the prospector ( voice of kelsey grammar ) .  they offer him another life , as a celebrity -- a toy in a museum in japan .  he is now forced to choose between being loved intensively by andy for a little while ( before he grows up ) and be forgotten , or be admired by children for generations .  the problem is , if woody escapes from al's clutches and returns home , they will end up back in the lonely darkness of storage .  a real effort is made in the technical department .  the animation is rich and colorful , with lots of wonderful details . the "" cinematography "" is also extremely improved since toy story ; there are a lot of complicated swings , turns and close-ups that really make an impression .  lighting and filters are used to create a mood ( as in a surprisingly emotional moment - jessie's remembrance of her days when she was a beloved toy ) the film contains a lot of in-side jokes ( such as the one about videogames ) , and entertaining parodies on "" jurassic park "" and "" star wars "" .  the film ends with the "" failed takes "" , the kind of scenes that we are used to see after comedy shows on tv .  these outtakes are some of the funniest scenes in the film .  but what in the end makes "" toy story 2 "" a memorable experience is not the jokes , its multiple parodies or marvelous animation .  it is its heart and emotions -- the story about the meaning of friendship , love and even life itself .  it is not difficult to predict that "" toy story 2 "" would be a huge economical success , but its artistic achievement was unexpected .  unexpected because the first film wasn't much more than a demonstration of special effects .  but mostly it was unexpected because disney hasn't produced anything spectacular in years and is constantly surpassed by companies such as dreamworks and warner brs .  but here the director has changed the atmosphere of the film , making it more accessible and interesting for persons older that 9 years .  this is a big step-away from the ancient laws of disney-animation .  off course , this is not "" antz "" , it is not as intelligent ; this is not a landmark and no masterpiece , but i promise that you'll find it as funny and enjoyable as i have .  whether this is the best animated film of the year , i dare not say .  my choice would probably be "" the iron giant "" , but ( along side with "" american pie "" ) this is the comedy of the year .  i almost lost my hopes for disney , but "" toy story 2 "" proves that disney hasn't lost their ability to entertain .

1|"not too many people know who james whale is , but it's a safe bet that a good chunk of them have seen his movies .  if we are to believe the semi- biographical gods and monsters , whale would have wanted it to be that way .  this is an insightful , haunting exploration of the last days of the frankenstein and bride of frankenstein director , and it is notable for introducing one of the first complicated gay characters in a hollywood movie .  gods and monsters has no interest in being a biopic of whale's life because it tracks only the final few days of his life , and it's probably a better movie for it .  it's focus is on whale's ( ian mckellen ) untraditional and deceptive lust for heterosexual gardener clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) .  it begins with whale ( a fairly talented artist , aside from being a director ) asking boone to "" sit for him , "" ( pose for a portrait ) .  at first , boone doesn't realize that whale is gay and grows fascinated with the old man .  when he does discover whale's sexual orientation from his dedicated and protective maid ( lynn redgrave ) , he is frightened , refusing to sit for the guy .  but he comes back , only to storm out again , disgusted with whale's "" locker room talk . ""  boone returns yet another time , after whale promises to tone down the aforementioned "" locker room talk , "" and finds their platonic relationship to be strengthening .  meanwhile , jimmy himself is suffering from hallucinations and mental attacks as a result of his stroke not long ago .  his ailment leads to desperation and depression , which build to the point where he is forced to ask boone for an incredulously big favor .  what is perhaps most sensational about gods and monsters is brendan fraser's bravura performance ; up until seeing this film i intensely disliked the young actor because of his tendency to ruin the movies he is in ( blast from the past , for example ) .  i was surprised how expressive an actor he proved himself to be here .  this is impressive because his character's dialogue is minimal , with mckellan doing most of the talking .  that requires fraser to act through body language ; a difficult skill to master , but something he proves capable of doing well .  this is not to ignore mckellan's oscar nominated turn .  he earned that nomination with his touching performance here ( although , at the risk of sounding like a philistine , i would have chosen his performance as the nazi in apt pupil for the nomination ) ; an understated , compelling gem .  whale dreaded being remembered solely for his work in the hollywood horror genre , and he thought hollywood to be the equivalent of a battlefield .  he rejoiced in being free from it , only reluctantly going to receptions with fellow movie people .  in the end , perhaps , it is what killed him : the memories of hollywood and war blending together to form a living nightmare .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  "|0.75|0.85|0.9333333333333332|"The explanations all indicate a positive sentiment towards the movie ""Gods and Monsters"" for its insightful and haunting exploration of James Whale's life, notable introduction of a complicated gay character, and commendable performances by Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser, although the mention of the director's suffering slightly dampens the overall sentiment."
1|"when i initially set out to review this film , my tag line was going to be "" you too can believe whales can fly "" .  then it was going to be "" you too can believe pastel triangles can fly "" .  then , it was going to be "" you too can believe wood sprites can fly "" .  finally , i just gave up trying to come up with a tag line and decided to say . . .  there's a lot of flying going on in this film !  as our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in .  well apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released .  part of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) .  subsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) .  to celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high .  in an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us .  after the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters .  is the format effective for the film ?  with a few exceptions , yes .  the first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven's fifth symphony .  it's hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily .  everything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts .  eventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things .  though this segment isn't very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies .  the next segment is set to ottorino respighi's "" the pines of rome "" .  in this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape .  a whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack .  he is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the "" oceans "" of clouds .  again , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved .  reportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size .  the cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images .  one especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent .  absolutely beautiful stuff .  the third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin's "" rhapsody in blue "" .  this segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york .  there's a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife .  i won't go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending .  unfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments .  segment four is set to dmitri shostakovich's "" piano concerto no . 2 "" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen's "" the steadfast tin soldier "" .  a one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can't see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester .  the jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina .  little does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from .  the soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl .  although the ending has been altered from the andersen story , "" the steadfast tin soldier "" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short .  some children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made .  segment five is the funniest of the bunch .  set to camille saint-saens "" the carnival of the animals "" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number .  while it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy .  segment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it's the one that people remember most , "" the sorcerer's apprentice "" .  the story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo .  unfortunately , the segment wasn't made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain .  there were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain .  similar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters .  segment seven is set to sir edward elgar's "" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 "" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character .  donald duck "" stars "" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark .  during the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn't make it on the boat .  they are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners .  despite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days .  powerful stuff .  segment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? "" saving the best for last "" .  set to igor stravinsky's "" the firebird "" , an elk awakens a forest sprite that proceeds to change the wintery landscape into a beautiful springtime landscape .  trees bloom and flowers blossom and everything seems to be going well until the sprite becomes inquisitive about a large mountain housing a strange formation .  when the sprite examines the formation , it awakens and becomes the titular firebird .  in a stunning spectacle , the firebird rears back and unleashes and fire storm that destroys everything in its path , including everything that the sprite has worked to create .  some amazing animation is present here , and well worth the ten dollars a ticket alone ( although brush strokes are evident in one scene due to the enlargement of the film ) .  the host segments are largely ( no pun intended ) throwaways , although steve martin's clip is pretty funny .  be sure to stay through the credits for a little more humor from martin .  penn and teller are usually funny , but here their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting .  the best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board .  pieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner's "" ride of the valkyries "" , and a strange segment prepared in the '40s by salvador dali that never was shown are all previewed here and teased that they may appear in future installments .  for fans of visual stimulation or classical music , fantasia 2000 is a perfect way to spend the afternoon .  the film is also decent family entertainment and contains little to no objectionable material .  as i mentioned earlier in the review , if ten dollars seems like too much for you to spend on this film , fear not because after its run in imax theaters it is going to be brought out in regular theaters .  i must stress that the best way to see this film is on an imax screen though .  then you too can believe that whales/triangle things/sprites can fly .

1|"it's tough to really say something nice about a type of person who's so ethnocentric that any humanity they once had is now gone , but by god , "" american history x "" does it , and for that , i commend it .  it not only takes balls but intelligence to make a human being out of a neo-nazi skinhead , a kind of person who dedicates their lives to hating anyone who's not what they are , and this film wisely and miracurously pulls it off .  the subject of this film is one of them , but he is worse than one of the blind followers that make up most skinhead members since he is the leader of the pack .  he's the one who instigates them to take a firm grip onto their rage , and then in another brilliant stroke , justifies it with political propoganda that makes eerie sense when he speaks .  he's so utterly convincing as a public speaker and so firm in his convictions that it comes as a shock when he actually goes through the rehabilitation process .  his name is derek vinyard , and he's played by edward norton with so much fire and intensity that when he speaks he's almost as convincing and arresting a public speaker as , say , malcom x . when we first see him , he's clean shaven , with a jet black swastica emrboidered on his left breast , a devlish goatee , and he's attacking the black carjackers outside of his house dressed in nothing but his white boxers and carrying a handgun in his hand that never seems to run out of bullets , at least when he doesn't need them .  he so believes in his convictions that he's willing to put his beliefs to the test , even if he knows it will mean a stop in prison , if only for a couple years .   "" american history x "" is about derek , how he became a neo-nazi skinhead , how he rose to power , how he was rehabilitated in prison after murdering two black men in a fit of rage that was less to do with the stealing of his car and more to do with proving himself , and how he tried to save others , namely his younger brother , from making the same mistake .  we see him at all of these stages - as a smart teenager , a vicious hate monger , a man having an epiphany , and the man who tries to correct what he's done before - and in all of these , we get a portrait of a man from all sides .  or at least , that's the intention .  the film's framing device is his brother , danny ( edward furlong , perpetually looking about 13 ) , also now a skinhead , and how his principal , bob sweeney ( avery brooks , who i just found out was or is the captain on star trek's deep space 9 ) , is trying to "" correct "" him .  when the film opens , danny has just written a book report on "" mein kampf , "" landing him in trouble with sweeney , which causes him to make him write a paper on derek's life and how it has gotten him nowhere .  coincidentally , this day is the day derek is released from prison , and when we see him , he's cleaned-up , not as buff , and has a full head of hair .  he's just as intelligent , but still very rough along the edges , but he's wisened up .  he's no longer controlled by his anger at blacks and jews , and tries to persuade danny , who's becoming what derek was before , to give up his lifestyle .  but danny won't .  he goes to a large skinhead beer bash , meets with the skinhead leader ( stacy keach ) , and then discovers that derek is as opposed to neo-nazi-dom as he was for it a couple of years ago .  the film circles around this , then spins off into non-linear flashbacks , all done in black and white .  we mostly see derek at his prime as a skinhead , living in venice beach , organizing vicious and quasi-sadistic raids on local stores that no longer hire the white , middle-class teenagers since they can easily get cheaper illegal immigrants to do the same work , and mouthing off his theories on affirmative action and how illegal immigrants and blacks have destroyed the fundamentals this country was built on .  to them , the white man is the one who has gotten the fuzzy end of the lolipop , and he not only speaks elloquently , forcefully , and intelligently , but he backs everything up with political reasons , justifying their rage at least to them .  and frighteningly enough , much of what he says sounds true .   "" american history x "" is a collection of really great scenes and moments , rather than a cohesive , great film that flows effortlessly from one moment to the next .  in it , there are some of the best scenes i've seen all year .  one scene features a dinner between derek's family , and his mother's newest boyfriend ( played with reserve by eliott gould ) , a jewish liberal who quietly disagrees with derek's rightist views , launching the scene into a fit of rage and anger that builds unparalled emotions in the audience ( gould's reaction to derek's final summation is unnerrving ) .  another scene uses humor and traditional macho sex talk to build a friendship and a nice connection between derek and a black co-worker ( guy torry ) while folding laundry in prison .  and another soon-to-be-classic is actually divided in two : the murder of the two black men that winds derek in jail , which contains a final murder so nasty that it may be the most revoltingly shocking all year .  there's much more to appreciate , like the acting , which is uniformly good , with stand-outs coming from avery brooks , beverly d'angelo ( as the long-suffering mother ) , and gould ( who has one horrible line , but other than that , comes off with the best performance he's given in what seems like a really long time ) .  norton walks off with the film , though , coming off with such intensity that he reduces anyone not doing an adequate job to rubble .  in only the fifth movie of his career , norton has invented himself as one of the most reliable and intense actors of his generation , and maybe the best .  there's nothing like it when norton really gets rolling in this movie , spewing out lines with such authority that he commands all attention from the audience , coming off with power similar to that of a young maron brando .  that he allows the little emotions to seep through is amazing .  sadly enough , this isn't going to be the great portrait of racism that it perhaps hopes to be .  it's too unambitious and even a little contrived to really take off as either a powerful statement or an emotional masterpiece .  the ending , especially , is pencilled in from other movies , tossed in just so the emotional keyboard can be trounced upon .  some of the skinheads are reduced to mere cliches ( kevin smith regular ethan suplee fairs rather annoyingly as the "" fat skinhead , "" whose lines consist without fail of expressing his desire to eat more ) , and even the dramatic arc isn't as well travelled .  furlong's danny never seems to really be learning a lesson , since the flashbacks refuse to show his point of view , and when he decides to make a change by the end ( which was inevitable ) , it doesn't seem like it has actually arrived there .  even derek's descent into skinhead-dom doesn't seem justified .  though his fireman father ( william russ , the dad from "" boy meets world , "" and don't ask me how i know that ) is killed by a black junkie , and even before he spoke against affirmative action intelligently , there never seems to be any real back story why derek became so intense about his beliefs .  as such , one can see why the director , tony kaye , wanted to have his name removed .  sorta .   "" american history x "" is a very good movie , and i was very moved by it , but it could be a lot better , and the problem seems to be that the cut as it is is not up to what he claims to be his potential .  somewhere , he claims , there lies a tony kaye cut , and that was to be the true cut until it was viewed by norton , who then ordered another cut , and that is thus .  although he aimed for the directing credit to go to "" alan smithee , "" the resident name for any film that is to be disowned by its director , it wasn't allowed to him , under the grounds that once you disown a film , you can not badmouth it ( but really , that's the macguffin - no one really wanted a film this good to be given the alan smithee sign of disapproval ) .  kaye's right in that it's not up to par , even if he's not referring to normal par but rather his own personal par .  this will not be a "" do the right thing "" for the late 90s .  yet it still gets its point across intelligently , and backs it up with its story ( its message , that one cannot be so enwrapped in one's own beliefs or pain and suffering will occur , is literally said over the narration , unfortunately ) .  and even if it isn't perfect , at least when avery brooks turns to norton after he has been beaten and raped in prison , and asks him if anything he's done has made his life any better , it realy hits a nerve , not only in derek , but also in the audience .

1|synopsis : as a response to accusations of sexual prejudice in the armed forces , a female naval intelligence officer is chosen to be a test case .  if she can survive the demanding s . e . a . l .  training , she will open the way for other women to be permitted to follow in her footsteps .  throw in a lot of political machinations , sabotage , brutality , water and sand and you have an entertaining movie .  review : the title of this movie turned me off at first .  i mean 'gi jane ? ' ? ? ? ? ?  the other titles which were considered were more promising - in pursuit of honor or a matter of honor would have been acceptable although navy cross or undisclosed are a little meaningless as far as i'm concerned .  i went into this movie not liking the title and being one of those people who thinks that demi moore is absolutely ghastly as an actor .  to my surprise i really enjoyed the movie .  moore as lieutenant jordan o'neil is much more likeable than her washed out excuse for a gusty woman in a few good men .  the storyline is simple .  anne bancroft playing senator lillian dehaven is a ruthless , machiavellian politician with an agenda to push .  using feminism to achieve political mileage , she forces the military powers that be to backdown and permit a test case to enter the highly intensive navy s . e . a . l .  training .  jordan is selected due to the fact that she has it all - looks , brains and strength .  the training is gruelling and the indignity almost painful to watch .  nonetheless , it's one of those movies that makes me want to cheer out and encourage the hapless hero/heroine along in his/her endeavours .  sure , there are the stereotypical elements - inhuman treatment , sexual innuendo , resentful peers , pained boyfriend and sexist commanding officer .  stepping away from the stereotypes though , viggo mortensen as master chief john urgayle tries to get away from being nothing more than a brutal screamer .  his character exercises a little more intellectual rigour than you would normally expect from such a character .  jordan's boyfriend royce is also in the military .  although they both started at the same time , due to the fact that he has seen active service , he has advanced through the ranks much more quickly than she has .  royce ( what is his surname ?  do we care ? )  almost resents jordan's attempts to advance herself , although he quickly settles down to being doe-eyed and supportive .  his character seems to have been thrown in so that we know that you don't have to be a lesbian to want to be in the military .  in parts , this is a very silly movie , with gratuitous lines and scenes thrown in for effect which are so blatantly obvious or contrived that it's hard not to cringe .  i still liked it though .  weaknesses in the script aside , this is a film which captures a heroic and reckless mood .  as we watch jordan's battle , it's increasingly clear that it is a personal battle .  this is an individual's fight for self-advancement .  we don't have to have our teeth set on edge by didactic preachings , we don't have to feel uncomfortable because we're having ideology thrust down our throats .  it's enough that we can sit back and hope that this one person gets what she wants and we can admire her tenacity and determination without coming out and saying whether we believe women should go into combat or not .  |0.5|0.8000000000000002|0.8333333333333334|The majority of the explanations suggest that the overall sentiment towards the movie is positive, with the reviewer initially having reservations but ultimately enjoying it.

1|"the idea at the center of the devil's advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- "" the last humanist "" .  he appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , "" vanity -- by far my favorite sin "" .  al pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( "" lemme givya a piece o' inside wisdom on god . . . "" , "" i have a million names . . . "" ) , as john milton -- the devil .  the main idea -- that he can appear as anyone , in any form ( in this case , a buisness man ) , harkens mainly back to terry gilliam's the time bandits .  but the film , is something else , something original .  part of what makes it so very good , is that it never takes itself too seriously -- it dabbles with morality , vanity , death , and child abuse , but doesn't try to become any profound study of power .  this is a marvelous confection -- cocky , funny , thought provoking .  it is also entertaining .  there is no way you could possibly predict the ending -- it pulls back upon itself , drawing purely out of the mind's eye .  the final shot is more creative , more daring , more challenging , then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen's fargo .  the central themes are fascinating ( sometimes reminiscent of james' the turn of the screw , and oates' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ) , and the product that is built around it really wows .  its nice to know that things like this are still being made .

1|"scream 2 , like its predecessor , is a genre-crossing film .  it is about 50% horror film and 50% murder mystery .  the mix worked very well last time and it continues to entertain this time .  scream was also known for its self-referential tone .  many inside jokes were made in reference to horror movies and wes craven .  again , scream 2 follows suit with characters saying such things as "" sequels suck "" and "" the entire horror genre was destroyed by sequels . ""  scream 2's story is very similar to it's predecessor's .  sidney ( neve campbell ) , having survived the killing spree in scream , is now in college .  gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a book about the murders and that book is now being released as a feature film , called stab ( which for all practical purposes is the real-world movie scream ) .  at the premiere of stab , two students from sidney's college are stabbed to death , and a new story begins .  the press descends on sidney and her college to get the scoop on this sequel killer .  they want to know all about the links between stab , sidney , and the recent murders .  the most complex self-reference i saw ( this should be an olympic event ) was the scene where gale weathers was asking questions at a press conference .  the rest of the press was watching and videotaping weathers .  the other survivors from scream were watching and videotaping the press .  the audience was watching the whole , filmed scene .   ( whew . )  the movie is packed with layers and self-references that make it a pleasure to watch .  even better would be to watch a double feature of scream and scream 2 . that's not to say that these references necessarily make scream 2 a deep , or even a good movie .  the just add to the fun of watching it .  i recommend it for other reasons as well .  what i liked best about the horror aspect of the movie is that the monster is not supernatural .  no werewolf or ghost or psycho with superhuman strength is responsible .  it is a person in a mask and a robe , his only advantage the fear he strikes into his victims .  no extraordinary leap of faith is needed to believe in the killer .  the down side is that if you are frightened by horror movies , you have less grounds to say "" it's just a movie . ""  the whodunit aspect of the movie is not that great by itself - gale weathers and deputy dewey ( david arquette , also from the original ) track down a killer .  they are likeable , but not outstanding .  but in combination with the horror aspect , the whodunit is a perfect counterpoint .  it was exactly a year ago today that i wrote the review for scream .  the internet movie database says that scream 3 is in the works , so i wonder if i'll be doing the same thing on january 1 , 1999 .  if craven and screenwriter kevin williamson are able to keep the quality high , i'll be happy to mark my calendar .

1|"when i first saw the previews for ron howard's latest film , my expectations were discouragingly low .  a show about nothing ?  sounds like "" seinfeld . ""  a guy whose entire life is broadcast 24 hours a day ?  sounds like "" the truman show . ""  what is it with hollywood that no sooner than one production company puts out an animated feature about ants , another puts one out about bugs ?  which is why i was pleasantly surprised by "" edtv , "" which turns out to be a fresh , insightful , and often times hilarious film about the follies of instant celebrity .  the writing , by howard's longtime collaborators lowell ganz and babaloo mandel , is right on the money and howard himself should be credited for giving the subject matter a fresh focus .  in the hands of a less-experienced director , "" edtv "" could easily have had all the flavor of yesterday's meatloaf .  with their 'true tv' cable ratings being threatened by 'the gardening channel' ( apparently people would rather watch soil ) , the northwest broadcasting company is looking for a novel concept to attract viewers .  program director cynthia topping ( ellen degeneres ) comes up with the idea of putting a nobody on the air and broadcasting his every waking and sleeping moment .  the hook is to find a regular guy , someone normal that people can relate to .  while scouting possible candidates , cynthia's camera crew discover ed pekurny and his pig brother ray ( woody harrelson ) in a bar , where ray believes he has what it takes for his fifteen plus minutes of fame .  but on watching the videotape , the show's producers are more taken with ed than with ray .  he's cute , he says all the wrong things , and he's 100% usda hick .  cynthia's boss , played by rob reiner , gives the show a week to deliver the goods and it's tough going in the early stages .  the most exciting thing that happens is ed brushes his teeth .   "" action shot ! ""  wags one of the production assistants when a couple of pop tarts jump out of the toaster .  you get the idea .  but soon enough , things--nielsen-boosting kinds of things--start to happen to this unassuming san francisco video store clerk and the 'true tv' cameras are right there to document it .  ed's privacy is no longer his own , his newfound fame starts having a negative impact on his family life , and what little dignity he has left is trampled on by the media .  who should ed go out with ?  you can be sure the pollsters have a list .  not only is the film exceedingly well cast , but its performers are consistently excellent .  matthew mcconaughey provides the face , the body language , and the lovable texan accent to fill the shoes of america's latest phenomenon .  he and harrelson look like they really could be brothers .  sally kirkland is noteworthy in a difficult role as ed's mother , and martin landau is one of the film's highlights as al , ed's ailing stepfather .  jenna elfman ( from tv's "" dharma and greg "" ) proves herself surprisingly worthy in the company of kirkland and landau , although those alpine eyebrows of hers get a little distracting .  even degeneres and reiner are better than you'd expect .  in 1979 , writer/director/comedian albert brooks made a zany little film called "" real life "" in which a small-time opportunist makes a real-time documentary about a typical american family .  the scenes of ed's family sitting around the dinner table feasting on kentucky fried chicken and waxing idiotic play like a big-budget variant on that film , paralleling its wickedly inventive humor .  as with most films by albert brooks , "" real life "" was funny , but absurd .  the funniest--and scariest--thing about "" edtv "" is that it is absolutely believable .

1|it is always refreshing to see a superstar actor who gets paid more than enough to forget about working for a living to want to take a chance and play a less-than-savoury character as mel gibson does in payback .  of course , if i was being paid $25 million for one month's work , i'd probably be willing to take risks as well , but that's neither here nor there .  payback is based on a novel by richard stark ( apparently actually donald e . westlake , author of the grifters , itself a fine crime film ) which was also filmed in the 1960s as point blank starring one of the toughest of tough guys , lee marvin .  the film opens with gibson having recovered from being shot several times in the back , by whom we don't know yet .  all we know is that gibson , as porter , isn't a happy chappy and is hellbent on getting the money stolen from him back , and getting even in the process , no matter what the consequences .  it turns out that the man he's after is val ( gregg henry ) , his sometime partner with whom he stole a briefcase full of cash from a gang of chinese mobsters .  obviously not having much of a crisis of the soul , val figures porter is dead and goes about using his share of the money to pay off a debt to his employers .  porter , however , is the sort of man who holds a grudge and once on his feet , goes about exacting revenge on the double-crossing val .  gibson gives a terrific performance in the sort of role which he was born to play , that of a slightly unhinged guy who doesn't mind beating up or shooting people to get what he wants .  you probably wouldn't see other actors in his salary range take such an offbeat , out-of-character role such as porter ( jim carrey won't be doing anything like this in a hurry after what happened the last time he tried - the cable guy , anyone ? ) .  harrison ford's idea of playing an unsympathetic character is presumed innocent ; the last time schwarzenegger played a villain was batman and robin , which we won't mention further ; and has stallone ever really played a villain at all ?  this is not to say that porter is a villain , per se .  while he isn't the sort of character you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of , he's nothing compared to some of the ones we are forced to watch in countless bad thrillers and action films where they kill innocent people in the blink of an eye or execute their right-hand men just to prove how mean they are .  porter is only trying to get back what is not-so-rightfully his , which in a way is almost understandable .  payback is an enjoyable dramatic black comedy-thriller which won't be remembered as being among gibson's most important work , but is still one of the finer films he's done .  the only real problem with it is that , while everything seems to work out in the end , i was left feeling something was lacking ; was that all ?  the ending looks as if it was tacked on at the last minute , and the final voice-over doesn't ring true , even though it was used to good effect elsewhere in the film-noir style the rest of the film embodies .  the film just ends far too suddenly , after a huge build-up in the penultimate scenes .  a fine film , even though it needs just a little something more to be the kind of a film that can be recommended without hesitation .  just be ready for a possible letdown of an ending .  |0.15833333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.7666666666666666|Overall, the sentiment of the texts is generally positive, with the reviewers praising Mel Gibson's performance, the enjoyable plot, and the film's film-noir style.

1|if you thought baz luhrmann's radical take on _william_shakespeare's_romeo_+_juliet_ was wild , wait until what you see what tony award-winning stage director julie taymor ( _the_lion_king : _the_broadway_musical_ ) does to the bard's _titus_andronicus_ for her audacious--and very bloody--film debut .  while luhrmann transplanted the star-crossed lovers to 1990s florida , taymor keeps this grisly tale of revenge in rome--but places it in a surreal temporal limbo .  the colosseum suggests the proper time of imperial rome , but high rises and heavy duty kitchen ovens suggest the 1990s , while the vintage automobiles and some costumes are more '40s and '50s , and other garments are more gladiator-like .  as tamora , queen of goths ( jessica lange ) exacts revenge on roman general titus ( anthony hopkins ) for killing her eldest son , and he does the same to her for the wrongs she commits , taymor obviously wanted to express the timeless relevance of the story's underlying themes .  however , the time convergence approach only works at times , for often it's just distracting , as in one scene where tamora's suviving sons ( matthew rhys and jonathan rhys meyers ) blow off steam playing video arcade games .  taymor didn't have to resort to such avant garde time tricks , for the story would have resonated just as strongly had she jettisoned them .  she is a strong storyteller and a master visual stylist , the latter compliment encompassing all areas , makeup and costume choices as well as those in the editing and photography departments .  she also has a sure way with actors ; hopkins' titus is at once tragic and horrifying , and lange is sultry as the viperous tamora .  the clear standout of the cast , however , is harry lennix as aaron , a moor who is tamora's secret lover and a schemer in his own right .  lennix brings great depth to a role that could have easily been played as a stock villain .  a great villain he indeed is , but to leave it at that isn't giving full justice to his powerful and multi-dimensional work .  _titus_ isn't a complete success , but it is never less than fascinating , and it announces the arrival of a fearlessly imaginative new cinematic voice .  |0.39999999999999997|0.8000000000000002|0.8333333333333334|"The reviews for the film ""Titus"" are mostly positive, praising the strong storytelling, visual style, and performances of the actors, while also acknowledging some distracting elements and the film not being a complete success."

1|"there is a striking scene early in "" city of angels , "" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise .  the camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black .  then the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up .  you see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch .  it is an important scene for several reasons .  first of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible .  the film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference .  there are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like "" angels in the outfield "" ( 1994 ) or "" michael "" ( 1996 ) .  the angels here are stark and believable .  this early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god's angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air .  there is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well .  they eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven .  like human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure .   "" city of angels "" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) .  he first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven .  maggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies .  angels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it's not enough .  he wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance .  he learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to "" fall "" and become human .  he learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( "" n . y . p . d .  blue "" ) in a touching and humorous performance .  sitting at a diner together , franz tells cage's character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person's skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children .  of course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it .   "" city of angels "" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender's haunting 1988 film "" wings of desire . ""  wenders' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened .  the americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human .  and , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn't suffer extensive damage .  this may be because director brad silberling ( "" casper "" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( "" blink "" ) wanted to make "" city of angels "" its own movie - inspired by "" wings of desire , "" but not an attempt to copy it .  and yet , "" city of angels "" is not a typical hollywood movie .  it is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( "" the english patient "" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world .  seale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by .  while the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are .  both cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances .  ryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch .  cage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have .  what is most striking about "" city of angels "" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging .  it's not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time .  it doesn't give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance .  instead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive .  ____________________________________________ visit "" charlie don't surf !

1|"star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 )  review by matt pusateri  few movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas' 1977 classic , star wars .  the original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture .  arguably , more americans today can explain what "" the force "" or a "" jedi "" is than a budget deficit or a serb .  so 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ?  can a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ?  against this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week .  and despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment .  while the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking .  it is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films .  the phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films .  as the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) .  the republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation .  the jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo's young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) .  later , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice .  on tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts .  qui-gon senses the child is "" unusually strong "" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be "" the one "" prophesized to "" bring balance to the force . ""  as anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader .  complicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala .  while amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul .  if the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is .  the phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin's turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy .  but the complexity is not overwhelming .  the story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode .  one of the reasons the film's story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused .  it's unclear whose story phantom menace is .  in the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke's story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight .  but it's unclear whether this new film is anakin's story or obi-wan's .  if this trilogy is centered on anakin , it's a shaky foundation .  lloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive .  on screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is "" the one . ""  the rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas .  neeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight .  mcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility .  portman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality .  the biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them .  individually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series .  but unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn't do as good of a job playing the characters off one another .  in star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke .  the ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities .  in the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other .  there is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other .  individually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them .  this is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers .  but despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging .  many of the wonderful elements of lucas' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining .  first , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates .  the characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing "" destroyers "" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council .  each location is elaborate and complex .  lucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines .  most of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren't possible when the films were made .  more than ever , in this new film , lucas' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters .  the best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves .  watto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room .  of all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable .  speaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks .  with more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy .  jar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon's accidental sidekick .  jar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble .  the animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors .  however , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn't completely convincing .  he still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene .  throughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a "" roger rabbit "" -like presence .  you accept that he's there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character .  initially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film .  on my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn't mind him at all .  a second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates .  despite all the film's struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one's destiny and "" the force , "" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously .  fortunately , lucas hasn't lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art .  from the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film's thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t .  in the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed .  and finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action .  from beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil .  the pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed .  the phantom menace won't win any major oscars .  it probably won't beat titanic's box office record .  and it's not even the best star wars film ( i'd put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) .  but it's an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster .  the film can't live up to it's hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that .  but it's still worth seeing . . .  probably more than once .

1|the premise is simple , if not bizarre .  a mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made .  why ?  it's torturous , it's maniacal , and it's just plain fun .  based on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn't torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely .  mike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies .  the catch is , these movies aren't the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike's will to live .  dr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema .  the purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man .  we watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them .  in this case , it's the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth .  we basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary .  the plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i'll explain this one .  this island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth .  together the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet .  to make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty .  mst3k , which doesn't actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken .  as funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long .  occasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously .  although it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste .  mst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don't know what you're in for , it could be a jarring disappointment .  although i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it .  warning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most .  the name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience .  most people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec's have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film .  |-0.25|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|"The sentiment of the explanations is slightly negative, with criticism of the ""torturous"" and ""unfunny"" aspects of the movie, but also an appreciation for the humor and wit."

1|"steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for "" the new yorker , "" several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 ) .  much of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called "" in search of the wily filipino . ""  now , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( 'everything being made now is crap' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood .  martin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned .  his accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called "" chubby rain , "" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops .  bowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america's top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star .  ramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously .  he sends his cast members ( who aren't in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey's table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc . , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance .  the paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time .  ramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities .   ( as if that's not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l . ron hubbard , founder of scientology . )  when he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble "" white code "" in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in .  murphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey's adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage .  always surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself .  furthermore , consider the enemies he'll make of popular scientologists .  pacing stricter's neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly .  murphy's scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta "" clearing . ""  not that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin's invention .  his script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry .   ( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerry renfro . )  martin's decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder's point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture .  as expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin's crew of mexican border-jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading "" cahiers du cinema , "" or martin's nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollars ( ! ) .  most of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen .  bowfinger's main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath .  we're also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem "" chubby rain , "" z-grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush .   ( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz's last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out . )  these are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece .  as i mentioned at the start of this review , bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham's character daisy does : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom .  that said , it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus : the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome .  martin gets sentimental by story's end as he did in l . a . story , and how could he not ?  for those who can hack it , the movies might be the greatest business in the world .
