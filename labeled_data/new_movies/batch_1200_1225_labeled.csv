0|"capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence .  visually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver's travels and treat it as an action film .  that makes it a film without much center .   , 0 ( -4 to +4 )  pierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire .  it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver's travels .  humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift's island of the houyhnhnms .  the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet .  it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that .  when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish .  the final irony of the original version has become film history .  without it there could never have been a "" planet of the apes "" film series .  i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language .  in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language .  that could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking .  serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film .  justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending .  but serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear .  few viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history .  partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith's best if not his best .  when the film's success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s .  while the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases .  the series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 .  now director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again .  for those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton's new version is even less faithful .  first , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes .  he has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes .  that could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes .  as with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring .  in 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world's most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes .  then a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet .   ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . )  he quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks .  and the language they talk is earth- english .  apparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that .  the fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn't occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film .  both just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english .  in any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships .  outside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic .  leo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter .  ari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power .  she is bent on making the world a better place .  perhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari .  in any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film .  she may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward .  it is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes .  this is a further abandonment of the source material .  the chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each's place in this reversed society , each important in the book .  we cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down .  we see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them .  burton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn .  this is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in .  they are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win .  the 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like "" i never met an ape i didn't like , "" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character .  most of what this film has to offer is in the visuals .  the visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog .  this tends to limit close looks at the makeup .  in general it seems much improved from 1968 .  the makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version .  in 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper .  it was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion .  chambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker .  today audiences have higher expectations ; baker's visualization is really an improvement .  these visuals work nicely .  what does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make .  they look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon .  apes spring incredible distances .  some of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost .  one final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up .  since the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up .  the one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti .  it is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes .  but he delivers them very well .  he was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom .  as the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well .  in doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen .  he is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov's performance in spartacus .  as an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself .  danny elfman's score has a nice primitive feel , but jerry goldsmith's 1968 tour de force score is a real classic .  that score and the whole film will be remembered when the 2001 film is forgotten .  i rate the remake 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

0|"jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today .  from time-to-time , she blows away audiences with powerful , intense performances .  on the other hand , this is the same woman who made her jaw-droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis' king kong .  and , much as lange would probably prefer movie-goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume , every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it , if only in quality .  hush is one such example .  lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film wasn't such a prime example of motion picture tedium .  the film opens , as many so-called "" psychological thrillers "" do , by posing as a light drama .  we are introduced to jackson ( johnathon schaech , last encounter in tom hanks' that thing you do ! ) and helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) , a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love .  jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother , martha ( lange ) .  the moment i first saw martha , i started looking for fangs .  soon , the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant ( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm ) .  once that goal is accomplished , she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives .  as long as she gets her way , martha is a perfectly amicable person , but when helen defies her , it's a declaration of war .  hush has three very simple problems : it's incredibly dumb , it's incredibly boring , and it's incredibly predictable ( at least up to the stupefying ending ) .  this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it , with the exception of a couple of nice shots of snow-covered fields and a quick glimpse of gwyneth paltrow's bare buttocks .  frankly , it's embarrassing to watch a respected actress of lange's stature give a performance like this -- it's like a bad blanche dubois ( the role she played in a 1995 tv version of a streetcar named desire ) .  meanwhile , paltrow does her best to get through her dialogue without gaping at the stupidity of some of her lines , and schaech attempts a passable imitation of an inanimate object .  as in all psychological thrillers , the battle lines are clearly drawn .  here , it's mom and against wife , with jackson caught in the middle .  of course , since schaech's character is poorly-developed and badly acted , it's impossible to say how he feels about being in that situation .  maybe someone should ask him if he's familiar with oedipus .  martha is , of course , the evil one .  how do we know she's evil ?  she smokes cigarettes and drinks hard liquor -- two sure signs that the devil is at work .  on the other hand , helen is a good girl .  the evidence for this is that she's nice to old ladies and treasures a locket with a picture of her dead parents .  that's about it for character development .  beyond that point , hush is just a series of increasingly hard-to-swallow coincidences , contrivances , and moronic plot twists .  however , the first 85 minutes are just a warm-up for the ending , which is as anticlimactic as it is profoundly dissatisfying .  i can't imagine anyone , no matter what they thought of the movie as a whole , liking this conclusion .  either there was some serious last-minute editing or someone left out a few pages of the script .  before the climax , i disliked hush ; by the time the end credits started , i hated it .  viewers invest something in every movie they watch , no matter how good or bad it is .  cheating them like this is offensive and unpardonable .  most entries into this worn-out , worm-eaten genre aren't especially good .  films like consenting adults , the hand that rocks the cradle , and single white female rely on stock plots and predictable twists to propel the narrative along .  in general , however , they're directed with a degree of competence that assures a level of sustained tension .  that's not the case with really bad thrillers like this , which fail to generate even a momentary heart palpitation -- the characters are too bland and the plot is too uninvolving for anyone in the audience to care .  indeed , the title of this movie probably refers to what the producers hope viewers will do in lieu of telling their friends what they really think of this sorry piece of celluloid .

0|"synopsis : sonny koufax ( adam sandler ) is a rich , childish , angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa ( kristy swanson ) .  in a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin ( jon stewart ) and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian ( cole and dylan sprouse ) while kevin is on an overseas trip .  under sonny's supervision julian soon learns to lie to women , tell people how he "" wipes his ass , "" throw tantrums , and scream for his "" god damned "" treats .  self centered , julian breaks a school classmate's arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong .  meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk , food , toys , and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform .  not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny's incompetent supervision , and this leads to a custody battle .  opinion : it's a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk , and we all get cheap laughs because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior .  that's the essence of big daddy .  but there's a bigger issue involved : marketing .  movies that are rated pg and pg-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below .  on tv , film clips advertise these movies as family-friendly hit comedies .  then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard - - or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment .  folks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff , but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation .  to many american mothers there's probably nothing more pathetic and unsettling than the sight of a theater full of unsupervised little eight year olds laughing raucously as movie character father adam sandler jokes about a woman's "" ice cold tits .

0|"certainly no one would rent ed wood's glen or glenda ?  expecting to see a good movie , but this screwy discourse about transvestitism betrays a level of incompetence that i didn't know was possible .  in fact , wood's infamous plan 9 from outer space actually seems pretty tame by comparison .  watching glen or glenda ?  i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together ; as a result , it is actually quite entertaining in that it is unintentionally hilarious .  the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary , with endless , repetitive narration about transvestites , how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend's clothes without being able to wear them , how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals , and how the main character , glen/glenda is ( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times ) "" not half man and half woman , but man and woman at the same time . ""  the camera work is terrible-occasionally the camera lingers on , say , a closed door while the characters talk off-screen , or inexplicably zooms in on someone's ear or nose .  wood also makes copious use of mostly irrelevant stock footage , which leads to voiced-over non-sequiturs like , "" yes , our world is a busy and frightening place , with so many people driving their automobiles . ""  finally , there is occasional commentary from bela lugosi as a sort of omniscient being who seems to inhabit a frankenstein-style laboratory , delivering pointless lines such as , "" people .   .   .  all with their own thoughts .   .   .  their own ideas .   .   .   . ""  while lightning crackles quasi-ominously overhead .  had wood continued in this vein , glen or glenda ?  probably would have been remembered as nothing more than a poorly done documentary with the occasional inappropriate horror-movie touch .  unfortunately , he then wanders so far off into left field that you have to wonder if he had been eating some funny mushrooms when he wrote the script .   "" pull the string !  pull the string ! ""  announces an alarmed lugosi as stock footage of buffalo appears .  there is another crash of lightning before lugosi returns , this time warning us , "" beware .   .   .  beware the big green dragon that lurks outside your door !   .   .   .  it eats little boys .   .   .  and puppy dogs' tails .   .   .  and big fat snails ! ""  a bizarre nightmare sequence , which is probably meant to be symbolic but instead is just incredibly stupid , ensues , during which glen/glenda finds his fiance trapped under a fallen tree-in the living room .  someone who is apparently intended to be the sinister "" green dragon "" ( but looks more like a klingon from the original star trek series ) appears to be orchestrating all this , though the film is far from clear on this point ( to put it kindly ) .  near the end of this scene-and here i must confess that wood lost me completely-is a violent sexual encounter on a couch that features two characters who do not even appear in the rest of the movie and is scored by goofily upbeat folk music .  after this scene ends ( not a moment too soon ) , glen or glenda ?  returns to its documentary style , but at that point any lingering sense that wood had the slightest idea what he was doing is pretty much gone .  the film wanders to a dumb happy ending that also seems to abandon much of what it was trying to say about transvestitism , but at that point it didn't matter much what happened .  as soon as the aforementioned sex scene was over , glen or glenda ?  had pretty much cemented its place in my mind as the most incoherent film i had ever seen .  i honestly think that if i picked up my camcorder and deliberately tried to make the worst movie i possibly could , it still might not match glen or glenda ?  for sheer cinematic disaster .  i am giving this movie an f , but i'm not sure that quite does it justice .

0|"this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup , and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film .  no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story .  however , even if one thinks of it as fiction , "" the prince of egypt "" remains shallow .  but i'll begin from the beginning .  the biggest difference between the original , biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible , whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero .  maybe it's just me , but if i knew i had god on my side , i'd have a little bit more confidence .  there are other differences as well , such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoah's death like it's nothing but a thing .  most of all , though , the story's focus has shifted .  rather than being a story about father-son , man-ethnicity , man-god , "" the prince of egypt "" is almost solely about the brother-brother relationship between rameses and moses .  i was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie , where it came off as maudlin .  rameses and moses squabble like children and then , in the interests of peace , moses saves rameses' butt , even though moses was the one who started it . . .   * yawn * i didn't care anymore by the time moses ran off for murdering an overseer ( which , of course , never happened in the original story - moses was exiled ) .  but enough about the differences .  let's talk about the movie itself .  it features a moses who , in the interests of making the character more human , lacks any divinity whatsoever , which isn't convincing at all to anyone who knows who god is .  it features a cookie-cutter "" i-wanna-please-dada "" rameses , who at least is given dignity by the voicework of ralph fiennes ( from schindler's list , among other things ) .  the film also features an extremely annoying character by way of the "" new-improved "" miriam , voiced by the ever-antsy sandra bullock , even though the most irritating thing about her is her tendency to burst into song for no apparent reason ( here bullock is replaced by a singing voice ) .  speaking of which , it contains * very * annoying music .  it contains shallow writing .  it features extraordinary animation , which is one good thing i can say about this film .  most of all , it contains an attempt to commercialize , homogenize , and mass-market a story about a manifestation of god .  i am not christian , but i got the impression of blasphemy .  the writers and producers took a butcher knife and chop-chopped into the story .

0|"for "" original sin , "" the road to the screen has been rocky .  initially slated for release last november , the film was bumped twice , finally landing in the dog days of summer 2001 .  advance screenings of the film were denied to all but a few critics , generally a sign that the studio realizes it has a dud on its hands .  so is "" original sin "" really all that bad ?  yes it is , but the melodrama does offer some rewards .  the location settings are gorgeous and there is a healthy sprinkling of t&a ( with angelina jolie providing the "" t "" and antonio banderas the "" a "" ) .  more importantly , the movie is entertainingly bad .  veteran readers know that , as a rule , i don't encourage people to patronize lousy films .  most of the time , there are plenty of quality offerings on the marketplace that are more deserving of our money and besides , the "" let's go laugh at the failings of others "" mindset reflects an elitism that makes me uncomfortable .  but things are different this summer .  quality films , to put it mildly , have been few and far between , so as far as i'm concerned , it's fair to find our kicks where we may .   "" original sin "" will never join such treasures as "" valley of the dolls , "" "" road house "" and "" showgirls "" in the bad movie hall of fame , but it'll do until something worse comes along .  the film , adapted by director michael cristofer from the cornell woolrich novel , "" waltz into darkness "" ( which was also the source for the 1969 francois truffaut film , "" mississippi mermaid "" ) , opens in a turn-of-the-century prison , as jolie's character , slated for a dawn execution , tells her lurid tale to a priest who appears desperately horny .  the freshman writing class tone is quickly established when she says things like , "" this is not a love story , it is a story about love . ""  wary of local gold-diggers , cuban coffee dealer luis antonio vargas ( banderas ) makes arrangements to secure a mail order bride from america , listing himself as a mere clerk to dissuade foreign gold-diggers .  a practical man , luis chooses a frumpy looking lady , hoping she will be a loyal mate able to provide him with children .  imagine his surprise when his fianc ? e , julia russell ( jolie ) , turns out to be infinitely more attractive than the woman in the photo .  julia explains that she sent a different woman's image because she didn't want to be selected solely for her pretty face .  luis then confesses his deception , leading julie to state , with great significance , "" we have something in common , we are both not to trusted . ""  after their wedding , luis and julia retire for a glorious night of carefully choreographed lovemaking , with their bodies positioned to display her breasts and his bottom as erotically as possible .  jolie and banderas are attractive people and watching them naked is fun , although the filmmakers' insistence on using one of banderas' legs to cover jolie's crotch makes it look like he's trying to climb her .  luis , the stupidest man who ever lived , immediately instructs the bank to make his personal and business accounts available to julia , despite the fact that she seems nothing like the woman with whom he corresponded .  his blissful ignorance continues as the warning signs mount up .  luis must force julia to write to her sister emily , who is frantic over her lack of communication .  shortly after julia complains about the chirping of a pet bird , it is found on the floor of its cage with a broken neck .  finally , when she cleans out his accounts and disappears , luis begins to suspect that something might be wrong .  incidentally , if you're afraid i'm giving too much away , rest assured that all of this happens in the first 30 minutes of the movie , leaving plenty of time for numerous dopey plot twists , a great deal of operatic acting and more footage of her tits and his ass .  along the way , private detective walter downs ( played by thomas jane , who was terrific as mickey mantle in the hbo movie "" 61 * "" ) turns up , hired by the frumpy woman's sister to find out what happened to the real julia .  luis is also eager for the detective to track down the con artist , having decided that if he can't have her , he will kill her .  oh , the pathos of it all .  the cast appears to recognize the trashiness of the story , adjusting their performances accordingly .  banderas is suitably impassioned , while jolie alternates between vamping and pouting ( and with those lips , she can really pout ) .  as for thomas jane , he starts off acting suspicious and cagey , then accelerates to a snidely whiplash level of nastiness .  his most startling moment comes when , to prove his power to humiliate , he forces luis against a wall , verbally taunts him while rubbing his cheeks against those of luis and then finishes establishing his dominance with a full-on kiss .  if anyone ever questions the difference between sex and rape , show them this chilling scene .  and if anyone ever questions the difference between real drama and a laughable potboiler , show them "" original sin .

0|"one would think that david duchovny , star of the cult favorite "" x-files "" would be very careful in choosing his leading man cinema roles .  at least one would hope so .  one would be seriously incorrect .  eugene sands ( duchovny ) is a surgeon so dedicated to his craft that he becomes addicted to amphetamines to stay awake and work more .  it turns out to be a bad plan when he loses a patient and his license while under the influence .  ten months later , in a seedy bar to score synthetic heroin , the doctor gets a chance to ply his trade when assassins gun down a customer .  using a plastic water bottle and bar tubing , sands operates and saves his life .  smalltime hoodlum raymond blossom ( timothy hutton ) is impressed with the cutlery skills on his associate .  he kidnaps and then offers down-and-out eugene a position in his organization .  blossom needs a doctor to patch up gunshot victims that would be problematic at a hospital .  sand's temptation is that this will give him a chance to practice medicine again albeit illegally , big chunks of cash to fuel his habit and close proximity to the gangster's womanfriend claire ( angelina jolie ) , this film's babe factor .  the would-be big time operator is desperately in need of help .  on the run from russian mobsters ( the bad guys that seem to be all the rage in this year's films ) and trying to cut a pirate software deal with the chinese mafia , blossom is surrounded by blood .  after a few medical misadventures , the physician grows disenchanted with his employment .  an encounter with a couple of psycho surfer dudes who threaten to blow him away unless he "" fixes "" their dead buddy cements his feeling that he is in the wrong line of work .  when the fbi visits and forces him to become an informant , there is no question that he needs to be somewhere else .  oddly enough , these seem like they could be exciting scenes .  the film disproves that assumption .  then a bunch of other uninteresting things happen .  writing this only two days after seeing the film , its a struggle to remember the events .  you can take that as a solid lack of recommendation .  for all the coolness that duchovny exhibits in "" x-files "" , it's a surprise that his big screen presence is so lacking in charisma .  the doctor is particularly bland and dull .  even the cold turkey bit which is rife with dramatic possibilities come across as banal .  a little chocolate and minor sweats get him through heroin withdrawal .  like virtually everything else in the film , it's a missed opportunity .  the fox mulder detachment doesn't work here .  oscar-winner hutton's manic mobster is much more difficult to get a handle on .  played partially for comedy and partially as crazed killer , blossom almost becomes real , but then sinks into goofiness .  most of the time hutton looks as if he's searching for his character and coming up empty .  jolie also makes a few false moves towards creating a three-dimensional human being before giving up and turning into scenery .  the most interesting aspect of her performance is watching her pouty lips threaten to take over the screen .  the rest aren't any better .  michael massee's eccentric fbi agent never revs up .  one of blossom's henchmen steals a few moments of the show as a quirky gunman reminiscent of val kilmer's doc holliday in "" tombstone "" .  his two-gunned blasting as he does a bizarre dance is the high point of the film .  but that 15 seconds isn't worth sitting through the other 90 minutes .  first time film director andy wilson ( known for his work on the british television series "" cracker "" ) appears to be attempting to jump on the "" pulp fiction "" bandwagon .  the best of these movies combine a sense of style and flash with significant substance .  the second-rate ones concentrate on just one of these aspects .   "" playing god "" does neither well .  the basic idea of the film is solid .  and then it goes nowhere .  even worse , it plods back and forth , up and down a long and winding road before it ends up nowhere .  fox fails yet again in his search for intelligent life .

""  starring jet li , bridget fonda , tch ? ky karyo , burt kwouk .  directed by chris nahon .  rated r .  it's no secret that martial arts film often use their plot simply to get from one action sequence to another .  when the fight scenes are enough to justify paying admission , there is no problem with this , as in most jackie chan projects and a lot of the hong kong actioners .  when they aren't , well , we're in bad shape .  kiss of the dragon , jet li's second consecutive american misfire , plays like one big miscalculation , and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment .  now before i start getting e-mails angrily touting the genius of jet li , let me explain myself .  li is as spectacular as ever here , and i don't think anyone would ever dare call his martial-arts-star skills into question .  the problem isn't with him , it's with the movie's tone .  the much touted fight-scenes here are filmed with such unflinching , unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch .  they're joyless , perfuctory ; li's rogue chinese detective is more of a killing machine than a hero , a terminator with a black belt instead of a metal skeleton .  but even the terminator in judgement day had a sympathetic side .  the plot isn't relevant , but if you're curious , it's some nonsense about a chinese law enforcement officer ( li ) sent to paris to investigate a possible drug ring and encounter a corrupt chief of police ( tcheky karyo ) , who kills people and does sinister things with no motivation whatsoever .  oh yeah , and li's character is also an acupuncture expert who is able to ease pain and/or kill at the touch of a needle .   "" kiss of the dragon "" is the name of an acupuncture maneuver , in which you stick a needle in a precise location on the back of the victim's neck , somehow redirecting all of the body's bloodflow to the brain and killing the poor sap more or less immediately .  there's a vague attempt to humanize li by having him fall in love with a downtrodden prostitute , whose daughter is being held hostage , for some reason , by the villain .  this is one of the worst love stories i have ever seen on screen , even worse than the one in pearl harbor .  there's no conviction whatsoever as the movie barely pays lip service to it ; it's only here because someone apparently thought there should be some kind of boy-meets-girl subplot .  kiss of the dragon was written by luc besson , whose screenplay the messenger : the story of joan of arc , for all of that film's flaws , was at least thoughtful .  i don't know why the guy got himself involved in this train wreck , but perhaps he wanted to so something more mainstream after the neverending weirdness of the fifth element and the aforementioned stylized biopic .  i suppose you could call this mainstream , but i'll choose the bizarre any time of the day .  if action scenes in a movie are going to be brutal instead of dazzling , you need a story to justify watching them .  the filmmakers behind kiss of the dragon should have rethought their strategy .  no one will walk out of this misbegotten project smiling , but i hear rush hour 2 is coming in just a few weeks .

""  and now , "" starship troopers "" director paul verhoeven adds one more image that will live in our memories forever : doogie houser doing a vulcan mind meld with a giant slug .   "" starship troopers , "" loosely based on the robert heinlein novel , is the story of an interstellar war between humans and giant insects .  in the hands of verhoeven , the mammoth sci-fi battle flick is one of the most astonishingly bad films ever made , a monument to inept filmmaking on a colossal scale .  to put it simply , it's a bug bomb .  in "" robocop "" and "" total recall , "" verhoeven displayed a gift for creating an entertaining mix of violence , special effects and social satire , and "" starship troopers "" starts off in similar fashion , with a tongue-in-cheek futuristic military recruitment ad that shows promise .  things go downhill fast , though , as we meet our heroes , a group of buenos aires teens preparing to graduate from high school .  inexplicably , johnny rico , carmen ibenez , dizzy flores and xander barcalow are played by square-jawed anglo kids who look like they just stepped out of a mountain dew commercial .  it's a veritable "" alpha centuri 90210 "" as we watch the love-smitten teens squabble in the name of love .  michael ironside plays their teacher , who waves around a cheesy fake severed arm while lecturing about civic responsibilities .  eventually , the kids join the military , with dreams of glory in their addled little minds .  one of their classmates , carl jenkins ( "" doogie houser's "" neil patrick harris , ) snags a job in military intelligence because of his strong psychic abilities .  he displays his gift by psychically ordering a pet ferret to crawl up his mother's leg .  a long , dull boot camp sequence follows , enlivened only by an extended coed shower scene where the recruits swap snappy banter as the "" showgirls "" director's camera roams over their buff bodies .  finally , a full hour into the film , the war finally starts and we meet the enemy .  the bugs hail from klendathu and colonize planets by hurling their spores into space .  they attack starships by spinning around and firing deadly plasma blasts from their rears .  yes , incredible as it seems , the bugs actually kill with cosmic farts .  a phenomenally large amount of money was spent creating the computer animated insects and the results are mixed at best .  sweeping distant shots depicting hordes of giant bugs racing to attack are both impressive and scary , but the close-ups are a different matter .  the insects have an odd , artificial look , like origami creations with a mottled plastic coating .  the attack scenes are intensely violent , as one would expect from verhoeven , but the overall look is too phony to generate any real tension .  while the action is frantic , the military strategy , wildly illogical even by hollywood standards , grows tiresome quickly .  verhoeven tries to spice things up by throwing in more satiric news coverage , but the faux-jingoistic scenes of children "" doing their part for the war effort "" by squishing roaches on a sidewalk aren't enough to make up for the long stretches of sheer dreck .  one can only guess what paul verhoeven was trying to do here .  his customary one part satire , two parts ultra-violence formula is way out of whack , and most of the film just flounders .  in "" showgirls "" fashion , some scenes are almost bad enough to be good .  an intergalactic kegger party , with jake busey playing "" dixie "" on a green plexiglas fiddle , has a certain bizarre appeal .  a sex scene between two of the teens achieves a smarmy charm , enhanced a few minutes later when the female receives a fatal jab from a bug , but tells her hero that she doesn't mind dying .   "" it's okay , "" she gasps , "" i got to have you ! ""  and then , of course , there's doogie's mind meld with a bug .  it's possible that verhoeven was attempting to create an homage to the era of the original novel .  heinlein's pre- "" stranger in a strange land "" books were aimed at adolescent males , and "" starship troopers "" has the antiseptic retro-future look of late 50s/early 60s sci-fi .  the one cityscape shown is a jetsons-like gleaming metropolis , with flying cars whizzing past an obvious matte painting .  the hairstyles are retro too , straight from the frankie avalon , annette funicello school of fashion .  ultimately , verhoeven's motives are irrelevant .  he has produce a gargantuan film that fails as an action film or as a social satire .  it even fails to be an entertaining bad movie .  avoid "" starship troopers "" at all costs .

"" heartbreakers "" reeks of that stagnant mentality , from its lingering shots of jennifer love hewitt's vah-vah-voom breasts to its leaden screenplay , which paints women as haughty schemers and men as drooling buffoons too sex-obsessed to realize they are being manipulated .  in addition to liotta and hewitt , the cast includes sigourney weaver , gene hackman , jason lee , nora dunn and anne bancroft .  i can't imagine what drew performers of their caliber to this project .  perhaps they thought it was a parody of the sniggering sex comedies of the '60s .  if so , they were sadly mistaken .  the story revolves around a mother-daughter con-team .  it opens with the marriage of max ( weaver ) to dean ( liotta ) , a new jersey chop shop operator .  having withheld sex until the honeymoon , max pretends to pass out on their wedding night .  the next morning , she feigns illness , sending a very horny dean off to the office , where he ends up in the arms of his new secretary .  just as the two are about to get overtly physical , max bursts into the room and catches them .  the "" horrified "" bride dissolves the union , garnering a healthy cash settlement along the way .  of course , the secretary was really her daughter page ( hewitt ) and the whole thing was a set-up .  the women move on , but an irs agent ( bancroft ) catches up with them and demands a huge amount of money to cover unpaid taxes .  in desperate need of funds , max and page head for palm beach to replay the scam .  their mark this time is william b . tensy ( hackman , in hideous make-up ) , a decrepit tobacco tycoon obsessed with the joys of smoking .  max starts to put the game into action , but page is so repelled by the old man ( and angry with her mom ) that she slips off to enact her own score , targeting jack , a laid back young beach bar owner who is worth a fortune .  complications arise when page realizes that good-natured jack is stirring actual emotions in her steely little heart .  as if that wasn't enough , dean reappears on the scene with revenge on his mind .  the attempt to weld a romance onto a caper comedy served only to remind me of the infinitely superior "" a fish called wanda . ""  i won't bother to compare the two .  suffice to say that everything done right in "" wanda "" is done wrong here .   "" heartbreakers "" is soulless , inept and , at 123 minutes , at least a half-hour too long .  sigourney weaver and jennifer love hewitt throw themselves into their parts , but have nowhere to go with the metallic characters .  gene hackman is utterly wasted in a one-note , one-joke part that has him doing nothing but smoking , coughing and waxing rhapsodic about smoking and sex .  poor jason lee is stuck in the ingenue role and the normally charismatic actor comes off as merely bland .  ray liotta manages to squeeze a tiny bit of humanity and humor into his walking clich ? , but only a bit .  the low point in the film has weaver employing a russian accent bad enough to make boris and natasha wince , while doing half-assed slapstick with a broken off penis from a statue .  bear in mind , though , that this is merely the worst segment of a movie made up of nothing but low points .  if you remember bob hope specials with fondness , this might be your cup of tea .  as for me , i'm going to watch "" a fish called wanda "" now and try to forget i ever saw "" heartbreakers .

0|last summer , a feature-length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning .  based on the famous 60's television show , the film was an enormous box-office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros . a year later , the studio is up to their old tricks again , with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild , wild west .  but it sounded promising : the same tag-team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld , who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success , is at the reins again .  and co-star kevin kline is attached to the project , as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects .  i mean , what could possibly go wrong ?  the answer is just about everything .  wild wild west is a cinematic abomination - a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate .  there are a lot of fancy special effects , and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression .  but the script is so deliriously uneven , the entire movie so off course , that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it .  at square one , we have a bizarre case of casting .  will smith plays james west , a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series .  my guess regarding the casting of african-american smith is a simple one : the actor + a cozy summertime release = big bucks for all those involved .  smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material , but this is not an ideal role for him .  he's too much of a joker .  i heard that initial casting included george clooney in the lead role , and frankly , that sounds a lot more plausible .  what makes matters worse is that smith goes through the role with such self-assurance in his eyes ; you can practically sense his contentment with the fact that he knows wild wild west will be a huge hit at the summer box office .  the plot involves west and cross-dressing government agent artemus gordon ( kevin kline ) , who are assigned by the president to recover a group of kidnapped scientists .  the trail leads to the diabolical dr . arliss loveless ( kenneth branagh ) , a man with no lower body who speaks in a dry , witty southern accent .  loveless has taken the country's top technical minds hostage so that they can assist in his deranged plan of total government control , using lethal superweapons to destroy entire towns .  one such weapon is an 80-foot mechanical tarantula , bearing eight spindly legs of thrashing metal and spewing enormous fireballs left and right .  the visual effects that bring this metallic bug to life are spectacular , seamlessly blending computer-generated imagery with the western surroundings .  unfortunately , all of these effects seem so detached from the story , and can do little to support the film's plot deficiencies , which are undoubtedly the main problem .  wild wild west is a running gag that never truly works .  most of the jokes , usually care of smith , die on arrival .  if it's one thing that could possibly be the saving grace , it's the performances , and even they are mostly off-kilter and poorly delivered .  kline is admirable , but he has little to do but invent silly devices on the spot .  salma hayek is wasted as the romantic interest , because she is viewed as little more than that - window dressing to look pretty and create conflict between west and gordon .  branagh , an esteemed shakespearean actor and director , adds marginal enjoyment to the film .  but even he is so utterly weird and over-the-top .  rarely is a film so lost in itself as wild wild west is .  i suppose there's always one turkey of the summer season ; a highly anticipated , big-budget release that manages to completely disappoint .  wild wild west is such a movie , and will probably go down as one of the biggest disappointments of 1999 .  but it is highly unlikely that this will go down in defeat at the box office .  perhaps after this , audiences will be less assured when they see will smith's name stamped on a summer movie .  after such hits as independence day and mib , wild wild west is not an impressive addition to the resume .  |-0.85|0.9|0.8000000000000002|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is highly negative, with the authors expressing disappointment and criticism towards the film ""Wild Wild West.""

0|at the outset of swordfish , john travolta's gabriel shear is pontificating about the status of american cinema today .  basically , he says , it boils down to a lack of imagination among the majority of writers .  how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture .  swordfish is loud , violent and amoral .  it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life .  and how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ?  by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists .  swordfish is a very cynical movie .  it relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration .  the movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is .  this is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions .  the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign .  talk about whacked-out patriotism .  my objections to swordfish are many .  the body count is high , but that is expected in a movie of this sort .  it's becoming a bore watching anonymous soldiers , police officers and government agents blown to bits .  another example is the family dynamics between stanley , his 10-year-old daughter and his ex-wife .  stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl .  audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films .  thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve .  in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed .  then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel .  children as pawns have become a most unwelcome clich ? in recent films .  there is enough violence in the real world involving children without having to make them on-screen victims as well .  yea , it's only make believe , but that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it .  travolta is cool , deadly charming and flamboyant as the near-crazy gabriel .  his character is reminiscent of his villainous characterizations in broken arrow and face/off .  jackman looks dour through most of the proceedings .  his only moment of any depth comes when he finally is able to create the worm to get inside the government database .  his sense of joy and accomplishment is one any computer whiz can appreciate .  halle berry is decorative and lovely as gabriel's assistant , while don cheadle is given little to do as the head fbi agent hunting gabriel .  swordfish plays like a comic book with a larger-than-life character in gabriel .  viewers align themselves with him despite their uncertainty if he is hero or villain .  and maybe that is the movie's underlying flaw : there is no real hero to speak of , only those doing their upmost to survive .  and that is not enough .  this is one swordfish that should have been thrown back in the water .  |-0.6833333333333332|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|"The explanations collectively express a negative sentiment towards the movie ""Swordfish"" due to criticisms of its violence, cynicism, portrayal of family dynamics, and the use of children as pawns, ultimately concluding that the movie should be avoided."

""  as the movie opens , therapist catharine deane ( jennifer lopez ) treats a catatonic boy ( colton james ) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that's never fully explained .  after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert , catharine has no success to report .  meanwhile , killer carl stargher ( vincent d'onofrio ) has claimed another victim .  his particular hobby is to kidnap young women , keep them in a glass cell overnight , and drown them .  he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach , then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning .  although carl's been doing this for awhile , he's recently become sloppy , and fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) is closing in fast .  not fast enough , though , to keep carl from sticking another woman ( tara subkoff ) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma .  from the videos in carl's house , peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction .  to save the kidnapped girl , peter has to find the cell before the end of the day , and comatose carl's not talking .  so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl's mind and find out where the cell is in time .  the focus of "" the cell "" in on the ornate interior of carl's mind , but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer-generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality .  for the most part , it's style without substance .  in his own mind , carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes , ming the merciless , as well as a frightened boy ( jake thomas ) abused by his father .  all in all , the mind of a psycho killer turns out to be a strangely dull place , and i kept wishing i could fast-forward to the next development .  singh is best known for directing music videos , particularly rem's "" losing my religion , "" and "" the cell "" seems very much like a really long , really slow mtv video with the sound deleted .  singer lopez seems to think she's in a video as well ; she devotes more time to posing in elaborate costumes than she does to acting .  the premise had great promise .  the computer-generated world within carl's mind could have been a bizarre , surreal universe governed by insanity and symbolism rather than logic .  the first room catharine enters in carl's head shows this promise .  she finds a horse standing in center of the room ; suddenly , sheets of sharp-edged glass fall into the horse , dividing it into segments .  the panes of glass separate , pulling apart the pieces of the still-living horse .  this scene is twisted , disturbing , and thought-provoking , because the psychological importance of the horse and its fate is left to the viewer to ponder .  another element that should have been developed is the effect on catharine of merging with the mind of a psychopath .  their minds begin to bleed together at one point in the movie , and this should have provided an opportunity to discover the dark corners of catharine's own psyche .  like sidney lumet's "" the offence "" or michael mann's "" manhunter , "" "" the cell "" could have explored how the madness of the killer brings out a repressed darkness in the investigator .  however , catharine's character is hardly developed at all , and lopez has no depth to offer the role .  bottom line : don't get trapped in this one .

"" 4 days to the millennium "" ) .  this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci-fi film strange days .  the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning , which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth "" surprise "" revelation is made .  entrapment , in other words , relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character's true motive is , resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion .  the star power here is quite strong , but the viewer can't help but feel the actors are wasted in this production .  sean connery is given such mind-numbing lines as "" never trust a naked woman . ""  ving rhames' character seems like an afterthought ; he's not developed at all .  the camera zooms in frequently and leeringly at catherine zeta-jones's tight wardrobe .  this , in and of itself , is not bad , but , after a while , it has a juvenile feel to it .  at least the species movies hold no bones about the fact that they're exploiting the female body .  entrapment does the same under the thin disguise of plot development ( sean connery supposedly falls in love with the girl while watching her , in tights , arc and pivot around laser beams ) .  the tagline for this movie reads "" the trap is set .
