1|copyright 1996 graeme huggan carry on henry is all about henry viii and his eight wives !  sid james plays henry , who no sooner has the film started , is getting rid of his present queen and hopes to find another one soon .  as part of his alliance with france , he requests the hand-in-marriage to the queen of normandy ( joan sims ) .  she comes to england in the hope of marrying henry but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath , he is totally averse to the idea of marriage .  henry's court is very corrupt , with the cardinal ( terry scott ) trying to bribe cromwell ( kenneth williams ) and cromwell trying to bribe the king .  there is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen ( sims ) in the tower of london ready for execution .  the queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before , so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey , who has a rather lecherous character to play this time .  the cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices !  owing to circumstances , sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and sometimes that he isn't .  this is because of renewed threats by the king of france ( peter gilmore ) to come over himself , which in the end he does .  by then , henry has found himself a new queen , played by none other than barbara windsor !  it looks like he has some explaining to do !  there are stand-out performances by sid james as henry , joan sims as marie , and terry scott in an unusual role as the cardinal .  also there are cameos from kenneth connor and peter butterworth , who plays barbara's father .  the set and costume design is first class and the overall production of this film is good .  there is even an early appearance from david prowse , who later became the green cross code man and darth vader .  the film does have it's downsides though , as it is getting pretty routine for the carry-on team to stage historical films and the inventive streak of the script seems to run out pretty quickly .  there is also the absence of hattie jacques and bernard bresslaw , who could have helped the film along .  however , overall the film is funny and there are plenty of laughs and saucy jokes , so that is why i mainly recommend it to carry on fans only , but there is enough humour in the film to make it worth anyone's while to sit down and watch it .  |0.30000000000000004|0.7666666666666666|0.8000000000000002|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is mixed, with a slight positive leaning.

1|"playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare's works .  they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ?  stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare .  and , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded .  shakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year .  it's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written .  it could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you've ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it's likely that you'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love .  joseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he's a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life's more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc . ) .  he's commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson ) .  shakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work .  he begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel .  this all changes , however , when he meets viola de lesseps ( a radiant gwyneth paltrow ) , a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented lord wessex ( colin firth ) .  shakespeare instantly falls in love with her ; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo .  he discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex .  but she continues to act because she loves shakespeare's writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed .  shakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter .  i was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he's clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care .  he practically overflows with passion in every scene .  fiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i've seen her in .  the two performers work perfectly together , taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic , and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh .  of course , it doesn't hurt that they have a masterful script to work with .  stoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor ) .  the first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet .  one of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid .  director john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director .  i'm going to have to see the movie again ; i'm certain there are numerous references that i missed .  in fact , i doubt it's possible to gather everything with just one viewing .  stoppard is a master of detail : you'll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time .  there's also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe's mysterious death in a pub .  there's also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing .   "" there's no dog in this play ? ""   "" no !  no dog ! ""  the ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year .  geoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe ; wilkinson is also hard to recognize , but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously .  ben affleck , playing one of the actors in the company , shows great range , both in his accent ( his is almost as good as paltrow's ) and in humor ( he has some of the best one-liners in the movie ) .  colin firth , always stuck playing the sap , does a good job being hateful .  judi dench , however , has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth : rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words .  my single , minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end .  the story is moving , but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes .  but my quibbling is not important .  what is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture , the sheer skill with which it has been written , acted , and produced .  shakespeare in love tries so many things , and nails every one of them : it's a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him , a film in which the actors , writers , and director are all perfectly in sync .  it's also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare's work in a positive way , without seeming condescending or superior .  i admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly , but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them .  not just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it .

1|"titantic , writer and director james cameron's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ?  as a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful .  if you've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again .  the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers .  in either case , it is filmmaking at its best .  when we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long .  he said no but that the time would go by so fast she'd never notice the length .  amazingly , he was right .  titanic is one of the few long films that doesn't suffer because of it .  the lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean .  fortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world's most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as "" the ship of dreams . ""  the necklace's hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story .  although almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk .  using a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing .  after twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage .  in a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast .  the strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing .  entering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane .  and thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class .  even with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes .  in contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board .  after jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair .  never tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story .  leonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma .  in so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part .  when he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal's supercilious put-downs .  kate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose .  the chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what's eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing .  from the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship's bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances .  if the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year .  peter lamont's sets are more than authentic .  one scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck .  it then shifts to the ship's massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals .  the handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner .  easily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest .  at first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else .  what a lark .  we've struck an iceberg .  now let's get back to our brandy and cigars .  the ship's musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in .  after all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers .  when the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it .  their civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless .  the story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface .  there are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on .  special effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable .  in titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs .  the most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water .  people are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately .  besides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor .  from the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears .   "" it's good-bye for a little while , "" a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first .   "" this boat's for mommies and children .  there'll be a boat in a little while for daddies . ""  basically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats -- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise .  perhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim's on-board the ship .  in the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink , he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew .   "" no thanks , "" the elegantly attired guggenheim replies .   "" we're dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen .  but we would like a brandy . ""  titanic runs 3 : 14 .  it is rated pg-13 for tastefully and delicately presented sex and nudity and would be fine for kids twelve and up .  "|0.85|0.9|0.8666666666666667|The movie is highly recommended as a wonderful love story with captivating performances and astonishing imagery, making it one of the best of the year.
1|"the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and "" real "" movies .  consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste .  top-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety .  based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story's structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel .  told in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan's version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator .  the author is even on record as applauding egoyan's changes .  in the press notes the book's author describes the story as "" a parable of lost children . ""  he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children .  picking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of "" the pied piper "" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges .  periodically throughout the picture , nicole's readings are heard in voice-over .  you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment .  they and the rest of the town's children come into harm's way -- some live and others are seriously injured .  and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again .  although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss .  ian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery .  mitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness .  his mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf .  if this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot .  the story unfolds slowly and always believably .  each little aspect has its own fascination .  as mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task .  he wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit .  wendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person's numerous faults .  although the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles .  one of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids .  well , single parent billy's fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita .  his confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story .  the accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn't shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film .  although the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy .  as the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning .  to round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear .  his daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another .  fond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk .   ( "" i can help you , "" mitchell tries to reassure billy .   "" not unless you can raise the dead , "" billy snaps back .  mitchell's pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . )  mychael danna's haunting music sets the stage for tragedy .  the cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best .  the show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience .  still , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did .  i could barely breathe ; i was so overcome by the sum total of what i had witnessed .  more than anything , the film is like a master painting .  each cinematic brush stroke is carefully laid down by egoyan with the beauty building with each dollop of paint .  with the final color in place , the masterpiece is complete , and the ending credits roll .  the sweet hereafter runs 1 : 50 .  it is rated r for mature themes , sexuality and some profanity and would be fine teenagers .

1|" ( warning to those who have not seen seven : this review contains some spoiler information . )  seven is a powerful , fully-realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs .  it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals--it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled .  while this film is not for the squeamish , there is no denying that seven demands attention , for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance .  for starters , classifying seven as a "" thriller "" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film .  while i was genuinely thrilled throughout , i would rather call seven an "" intense drama , "" because that is what it delivers--meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up .  part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style .  he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as "" simple "" as a corpse .  and visually , fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all-too-realistic and graphic terms ( courtesy of rob bottin's always-grisly special effects ) .  throw in the appropriate but not-to-be-underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene .  these scenes alone are quite impressive ; as fascinating as they are harrowing .  yet , seven is more than just a technical accomplishment .  in addition to style , fincher supplies substance .  seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand , and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society .  detective william somerset ( morgan freeman ) is a man who has nearly given up on the world .  its easy to see why .  the world doesn't make sense .   ( somerset drives this point home with a rather ghastly story of a robbery victim who was attacked just blocks from the police precinct .  after knocked down and robbed of his wallet , the attacker stabbed the helpless man in both eyes . )  why should somerset believe that by following this murder investigation and "" picking up the pieces "" he will be able to catch the killer ?  somersets new partner , david mills ( brad pitt ) has not given up on the world , perhaps because he is still young ( and perhaps by having this optimism he's naive in this films portrayal of the world ) .  he completely disagrees with somersets abandonment of hope .  however , david's wife ( gwyneth paltrow ) has so much fear of her urban surroundings , she isn't even sure if she wants to * tell * her husband about her recent pregnancy , let alone carry it until birth and attempt to raise it in this environment .  these three characters are all performed with skill and authenticity that makes them feel like real people and not the typical hollywood characters a lesser film might have offered .  and in addition to making clear how each of these characters sees the world , fincher gives us support for * why * they feel the way they do .  but if there's one character that underlines the message seven is trying to convey , it has to be the killer , john doe ( kevin spacey ) .  seven's payoff lies in its ability to allow us to see how the killer views the world and what drives him to do what he does .  one important thing to remember about doe is how easy it is to simply dismiss him as a "" psycho , "" with no motives behind his slayings .  this is exactly the mistake mills makes .  in the extremely intense and superbly performed closing scenes , were allowed to see that doe is , in his mind , merely a product of society .  he's a killer who kills those who are bringing society down .  in his mind he didn't kill "" innocent "" people , and , perhaps , they were not completely innocent ( but , then again , who is ? ) .  hes absolutely infuriated that mills believes that the murder victims were innocent .  really , seven doesn't just comment on the superficial obviousness of how screwed-up john doe is .  seven makes larger statements about how screwed-up society is , hinting that society's degradation is simply conducive of creating more john does .  besides the stylistic and larger-issue arguments for seeing this film , i recommend seven because it is , after all , also a very slick and well-made thriller .  it features exciting plot developments , commanding performances , lots of suspense , and a conclusion that is chilling , riveting , and quite unfair .  but then again , its a cruel world .

1|modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop-broadway musical rather than victor hugo's original tome .  adapted several times for the cinema , this latest effort does a superb job of translating the characters , story , and heart of the novel to the screen .  liam neeson stars as jean valjean .  as a young man , valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger . . . and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes .  prison hardened him , and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor .  however , an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life , and he vows to become a better man .  however , he runs up against one man who doesn't believe in reform .  inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is an obsessive law abider .  he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules , even with benign intentions .  he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served , and after valjean breaks his parole , javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice .  two women also get caught up in the struggle .  fantine ( uma thurman ) is an unwed mother suffocating in an unforgiving society .  her daughter , cosette ( mimi newman , and later , claire danes ) , is her life , yet she cannot afford to raise her .  instead , cosette is sent to live with a cruel foster family which extorts money from fantine , and forces cosette into a life little better than a slave .  director bille august manages to create a faithful adaptation of victor hugo's novel , which , though omitting some of the political undertones , remains true to the overall story and tone of the book .  hopefully you won't , as some clueless members of the audience did , wonder where all the songs went .  the movie manages to be completely engrossing without the andrew lloyd webber flourishes .  the experience is bolstered by strong performances throughout , though neeson and rush deservedly take center stage with their core roles .  neeson in particular deserves kudos for his portrayal of a man trying to do good , but continually haunted by his past .  the supporting cast is also extraordinary .  the only actor who dims in comparison is hans matheson , playing the revolutionary , marius .  the film slightly loses its luster during his brief love affair , but it is transitory , and truly only distracting when contrasted with the rest of the film .  the novel les misirables is , by any account , an epic , both in its scope and in its length .  while it would be nearly impossible to cram everything from its pages into a two hour movie , this latest attempt does an admirable job at the translation .  it , too , is an epic . . . and one worth seeing .  |0.75|0.9166666666666666|0.8166666666666668|The sentiment of the text is overall positive, with reviewers praising the faithful adaptation of the novel, strong performances, and ability to engage the audience.

1|"i was born in 1970 , which makes me barely old enough to remember bell buttons , 8 tracks and disco .  however , since i was 17 years old i've seen more than my share of adult films .  i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i'm not against pornogrpahy .  i've seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available .  director paul thomas anderson's boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema , the mid to late 70s .  this was the period when x-rated movies were real movies , shot on film , shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics .  this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films , films that attempted to tell a real story .  one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how , like in an any other billion dollar industry , the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete .  in this case , the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette .  burt reynold's manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur , known as jack horner .  horner's has a steady "" family "" of performers , some of whom live in his plush l . a . home .  but in the world of porn , performers are a commodity - the fresher , the better .  when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable .  it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his .  as directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door .  boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l . a . 's hardcore film scene .  but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends .  the downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut .  by the film's final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams .  boogie nights is not about sex .  it does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers .  in fact , the film isn't really about pornography at all .  pornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are .  the film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world .  yet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively .  the characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion .  first stop , the den mother ( julianne moore ) in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son .  second stop , the cuckold crewman ( william h . macy ) who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone ( the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real-life porn star nina hartley ) .  but the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams .  eddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it .  with no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame .  his alcoholic mother , clearly dissatisfied with her own lot , abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house .  horner introduces him to amber waves ( moore ) who immediately adopts him , a nuclear family is born .  the surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her "" babies "" provides some of the films most poignant scenes .  clearly , she is not even fit to manage her own life , let alone nurture these lost children .  but the need to love and be loved is so strong , they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to .  even the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family .  then again , perhaps its not so different from real families at all .  eddie adams , who later takes on the screen name "" dirk diggler "" , is skillfully acted by former pop-star , mark wahlberg .  i say "" former "" pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job .  this is bold and brave territory for such a young man .  he pulls it off marvelously .  wahlberg is a "" big , bright star "" with a big bright future .  boogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt , without the first amendment preachiness .  its intimate studies of character make it the superior film .  wahlberg's surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson's .  but in my opinion , boogie nights , is not the best film of the year .  i got the feeling that itus 2 1/2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance .  still , if the subject matter of this film intimidates you , thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing , but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway . . . ya  know , kinda like disco .

1|i remember making a pact , right after `patch adams' , to not be easily be suckered by movies dripping with sentimentality .  but darn it , `music of the heart' is just layered with feel-good material and bright characterizations .  it's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it's manipulation .  in addition , it's also a terrific family film .  this is the true story of violin teacher roberta guaspari , who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools .  it could also be described as `mrs .  streep's opus' .  yes , meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari , and that brings both good news and bad .  out of the gate , possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing , it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta's character and grasp her academic point-of-view .  she is very strict with her students , but what insight does that create into the story ?  slowly but surely , we begin to recognize the intentions of the character , and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied .  one thoroughly interesting fact about `music of the heart' lies with the unlikely presence in the director's chair : horror veteran wes craven .  after leaving an impression with the `scream' films and the original `nightmare on elm street' , craven has attempted a precarious cross-over to drama .  at first , his inexperience with the genre is fairly obvious , but as the film progresses craven finds a surprisingly comfortable niche with directing this material .  it doesn't carry the heart-warming courage of `mr .  holland's opus' , but `music of the heart' is casually assured and filled with little morsels of dramatic truth .  the tag team of streep and craven works better than you would anticipate .  yes , oscar could come calling once again for meryl streep , but it's the solid ensemble cast that makes `music of the heart' work .  angela bassett displays her usual forceful stamina as janet williams , the principal at an inner city school who initially doesn't hire roberta because of her lack of experience .  blue-eyed adian quinn is endearing , as always , playing a new love interest .  gloria estefan also delivers in the tiny role of a supportive second-grade teacher , and the three lead actresses together produce a flaming fireball of estrogenic force .  it's like a schoolteacher's version of `thelma and louise' , in a restrained but effective manner .  the movie tackles more issues than just guaspari's teaching of violin .  there's some powerful moments between roberta and her two sons , who must cope when their father leaves them for another woman .  in it's dramatic build-up , the movie manages to produce some authentic moments of feeling and warmth .  it's a good movie for anyone to see , although missing out on the experience would not be a life-altering decision .  it's commendable of wes craven to be attempting such a difficult cross-over , and also for achieving his intricate goal .  watching this heartfelt chick flick about morals and musical instruments , who may ask yourself : this is the guy who directed `scream' ?  of course , when the third installment of that series comes around in february 2000 ( with craven directing ) , you may find yourself wondering : this is the guy who directed `music of the heart' ?  mission accomplished , wes .  thankfully , there is no layer of artificial sentiment covering the film .  in it's entirety , it's a wholesome and agreeable movie for the whole family , despite the periodic flaws that surface every once in awhile .  the child actors are cute and perform up to par , even if some of their problems are clich ? d and predictable in the extreme .  the mother who doesn't want her son to be learning `white man's music' , the unexpected casuality . . .  basically everything is there .  it doesn't strike the perfect chord , but `music of the heart' is highly convincing .  the uplifting true story of roberta guaspari could have been told better , but `music of the heart' is still edifying enough to properly divulge her morals .  |0.547|0.8333333333333334|0.8833333333333333|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive, with praise for the feel-good material, bright characterizations, and skillful manipulation in ""Music of the Heart.""

1|vannesa kensington : `austin , do you smoke after sex ? ' austin powers : `i don't know baby , i've never looked ! '  and so begins our journey into the most anticipated sequel of the summer season .  austin powers 2 , the sequel to the sleeper hit of 1997 , is filled to the brim with uproarious sight gags and lurid toilet jokes that will make you keel over with hilarity .  the mind of mike myers is obviously a very bizarre place .  myers returns as the swinging 60's spy and his arch-nemesis , the bald headed dr . evil , who is given much of the spotlight here .  there's an early scene in which dr . evil and his son scott ( seth green ) appear on a jerry springer segment entitled `my dad is evil and wants to take over the world' , hosted by springer himself .  most of these talk-show gags , spoofing everything from oprah to regis and kathie lee , are no longer as funny as they once were .  happily , this is an exception , especially when a fight breaks out between dr . evil and the other guests .   ( sample dialogue- `come back here you mother #@%$^ ! !  you want a piece of me ? ' )  the audience was in stitches .  there are many good things about this sequel .  dr . evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry .  mini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all .  mindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber .  this works surprisingly well .  afterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment .  oh , yes . . .  the plot .  after a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr . evil .  in the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods .  here , it's time travel .  dr . evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber .  there , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless .  meanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle .  once back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr . evil's plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon .  in one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a `death star' .  if there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it's austin powers : the spy who shagged me .  ap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers .  but what it doesn't have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit-and-miss .  while myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits .  the hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner .  robert wagner , as dr . evil's #2 man , has only one scene early on in the film , where he lacks all the focus of the character .  one nice surprise is rob lowe , as the young #2 , who patterns wagner's voice and movements right down to a tee .  there are more recycled jokes from the predecessor , including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot ( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina ) .  but myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project , and many bits are side-splittingly funny .  don't miss an extended visual gag in a tent , where the shadows leave much to the imagination . . . .  of the new characters , graham doesn't leave much of an impression .  her performance is merely okay , and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her .  and as for fat bastard . . .  well , he provides one or two hilarious moments , but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far .  but my most severe complaint : mr . bigglesworth was only in one scene ! !  but , with gritted teeth , i managed to get over that .  this sequel will not leave fans disappointed ; it's more often than not a laugh riot .  and , i look optimistically to the future , where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection .  if myers can up the quota of fresh ideas , we should be in store for much more .

1|the premise of the new teen-targeted horror film `final destination' causes a recollection of a memorable `simpsons' halloween episode .  after attempting to repair a malfunctioning toaster , lovably ignorant patriarch homer realizes he has created a portable time-machine .  after a trek into the cretaceous period , homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world .  again and again , homer toys with the master plan and pays dearly for it .  the characters of `final destination' have also tampered with the blueprint schematics of their existence - their `design' .  someone is after them with the strict intent of correcting the mistake .  that someone is death .  you see , alex browning ( devon sawa ) and six others have cheated the grim reaper . . . .  but the dude has got some tricks up his sleeve .  for a high school excursion , alex's french class is traveling to paris by airline transport .  alex , tense and neurotic , has a shocking premonition after boarding : he sees the plane , and every passenger on it , spontaneously explode in mid-air .  in a panic of sheer lunacy , alex charges his way through the aisle and demands removal from the aircraft .  after a handful of others ( including one teacher ) follow and are denied admittance back onto the plane , the unwitting ? survivors' watch in horror as the plane actually explodes in the drizzling night sky .  the loony vision alex experiences does actually materialize .  but death won't be cheated so easily , and one by one , the survivors of flight 180 are offed in mysteriously gruesome circumstances .  the grisly murder count baffles the local officials and fbi .  before i delve into the meat of the review , i'd just like to confer . . . .  is that one helluva premise , or what ?  `final destination' , creepy beyond rational comprehension , probably reads more like an unsettling `x-files' episode than `the simpsons' - therefore , the surprise is minimal when you discover the mutual creators behind both are glen morgan and james wong .  on familiar turf , the task of establishing footing is not difficult for morgan and wong , and the opening 20 minutes of `final destination' reflects that .  unlike most thrillers , the set-up is crisp and cool .  you just deeply , sincerely hope that the momentum won't unspool , leaving us with a second-string effort with nothing but cheap , derivative shocks .  young viewers have a palpable reason to expect this kind of formula deterioration , what with `i know what you did last summer' and sequel , `idle hands' and -- a movie with a nifty premise that just plunged like an anvil -- `urban legend' .  after the set-up , when i remained slouched apprehensively in my chair , i started to really have fun with `final destination' .  low and behold , a teen thriller that is actually unsettling , actually suspenseful and -- yes -- actually intelligent .  some splotty logic and a heap of characteristic genre flaws aside , this film is among the most refreshing and all-out enjoyable horror movies to submerge since the cutting-edge `scream' in 1996 .  `final destination' stimulates the nerves and offers a exhilarating retaliation strike against all the blood-spattered slasher crap we've endured throughout the past few years .  not that the characters are that good .  sawa is game as alex , a connect-the-dots personality that we never fully comprehend .  in addition , the survivors are endearing geek tod ( chad e . donella ) , jocky control-freak carter ( kerr smith of `dawson's creek' ) , carter's ditzy girlfriend terry ( amanda detmer ) , the none-too-subtly named billy hitchcock ( seann william scott , supplier of lukewarm comic relief ) and a lone teacher - the emotionally delicate ms . lewton ( kristin cloke ) .  aside from alex , the primary center of interest is intended to be ali larter ( `varsity blues' ) , playing an abstract character named clear rivers ( what were her parents thinking ? ! ? ) .  the personality of clear is written with such a vague , nebulous definition that she resembles a walking flash-card saying `hello , i am the offbeat character designed to identify with the main character's plight ! '  toss a few stereotypical fbi agents ( daniel roebuck and roger guenveur smith ) and a . . . . ummm . . .  `spiritual' mortician ( former `candyman' tony todd ) into the mix , and you have what could be another generic teenage frightfest with slicing , dicing and assorted disembowelments .  not so .  `final destination' has no slicing and dicing , or at least none dealt by a human killer , and the thought of death itself as the unseen stalker is unique and frightening .  the extra dimension of disconcerting irony rejuvenates the decaying ? murderer-on-the-loose' concept , with assistance from a shrewd , intelligently paced screenplay by morgan , wong and jeffrey reddick .  the plot twists are fun and clever without toppling into utter absurdity ( listen up , `reindeer games' ) .  but i suppose the most satisfying aspect of `final destination' is the murder scenes .  creative , resourceful and breathlessly inventive , the death sequences involve an unlikely string of events leading to a character's demise .  what will trigger the accident ?  will it be the john denver record , just put on to play `rocky mountain high' ?   ( yeah , sick humor ) .  will it be the leaking toilet ?  the falling fishing reel in the corner ?  the murders are startling and largely unforeseen , including one surprise incident that made the audience jump out of their seats and giggle nervously for roughly a minute afterward .  a sense of giddy unpredictability is added with this inventive approach .  it gets sorta tasteless and cheap sometimes , but who cares ?  it's fun .  in that simple regard , `final destination' is my cup of tea .  this stylishly executed thriller , although tagged with laughable circumstances and the occasional snippet of lame dialogue , is an immensely entertaining jaunt to the dark side .  after the show , it will also have an frightening impact on you .  when will your ? design' expire ?  is death waiting around the corner ?  the `final' effect is a major case of the heebie-jeebies .  |0.018100000000000005|0.8477333333333332|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly positive with praises for the premise, set-up, and murder scenes of ""Final Destination,"" but some criticisms for the characters and dialogue."
1|"it is easy to see why the late stanley kubrick believed steven spielberg would be the perfect director for his a . i .  artificial intelligence , just as it is understandable why spielberg was attracted to the material .  for here we have another lost boy trying to find his way home , an outcast seeking family , themes very familiar from most of spielberg's body of work from sugarland express to close encounters of the third kind to e . t .  to empire of the sun to hook to saving private ryan , naming just a few examples .  a . i . is set in an undefined near future in which giant technological advances have led to the creation of robots who serve every purpose from housekeeping to fulfilling sexual fantasies .  it is an era when robots are treated merely as sophisticated appliances .  the last great leap in robotic evolution is the addition of emotions , and with the number of births limited by the government , many couples are yearning for children .  and professor hobby ( william hurt ) has the solution .  a robotic boy named david ( haley joel osment ) , who is programmed to love .  as a test , david is placed with henry swinton ( sam robards ) and his wife , monica ( frances o'connor ) .  their natural-born son has been cryogenically frozen until a cure can be found for his illness .  the first third of a . i .  deals with david's life with the swintons and how that is changed by the recovery and return of their son , martin .  circumstances force david to be cut off from the swintons .  he is abandoned and alone .  david , highly influenced by the fairy tale , pinocchio , feels that if he becomes a real boy he can rekindle monica's love for him .  the film's second act follows david's search for the blue fairy , whom he believes will be able to fulfill his wish .  during these adventures he meets and is helped by gigolo joe ( jude law ) , a robot who specializes in sex .  spielberg is at his top form in this sequence , offering a brutal "" flesh fair "" where robots are destroyed via sadistic methods for the amusement of paying customers .  here , is where kubrick's influence is strongly felt , as the movie explores the fear and distrust humans have for robots .  the savagery conjures up images from the late director's a clockwork orange .  at about two hours and 30 minutes , the film begins to falter during the last 20 minutes , a sequence that seems most spielbergian with images that appear to be borrowed from close encounters .  it is all very anti-climatic and jarring .  these scenes seem almost superfluous , as if from a different film .  a . i . is a dark fairy tale that deserves its pg-13 rating .  it is a story combining hope and intolerance , sacrifice and bigotry , and while it does not coalesce perfectly , the movie does offer some disturbing images .  but a . i .  is really a showcase for the acting talents of the amazing young osment .  if ever an actor deserved an academy award nomination , it is this lad , who brings a sense of joy and wonder to the role of david , a being created for the express purpose of loving .  he shines when with monica , beaming with love , as eager as a puppy to please .  after being left in the woods , he is confused , lost , hurt , focusing on one objective : to become a real boy and find his way home so he can redeem himself in his mother's eyes .  law is pleasant as the care-free robot who really doesn't understand david's quest , but is nonetheless happy to help him on his journey .  probably the toughest role is o'connor's monica .  playing an emotional fragile woman who sees david as a substitute for her lost martin , she grows conflicted after her boy returns and she begins to perceive david not as a second chance , but as a threat to her family .  she gives her character enough emotional chaos that you cannot fault her for her course of action .  many of a . i . 's futuristic sets are breathtaking , especially a mostly submerged new york , lost to the world by the melting of the polar ice caps .  a . i . is a flawed film , and you cannot get through the entire feature without pondering - even subconsciously - how it would have turned out with kubrick instead of spielberg behind the camera .  would it have been darker ?  more cynical ?  we will never know .  we can only judge what is before us on the screen , a collaboration of two cinematic giants .  a . i .  is a most interesting and thought-provoking examination of a future that is quickly gaining on us .

1|"here's a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler's list is to jurassic park .  in 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler's list as the director's "" penance "" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster ) .  now , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance .  once again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers .  now , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity .  that film is amistad .  although not as masterful as schindler's list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture .  thematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact .  watching schindler's list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience .  spielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later .  aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since .  amistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent .  the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that's not a surprise .  however , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order .  several , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film's dramatic force .  on the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired .  one stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape .  led by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew .  adrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey .  they are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut .  the kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy .  the first men to come to the africans' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) .  they are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute .  aided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge .  but powerful forces have aligned against baldwin's cause .  current president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free .  at its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage .  cinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to .  he is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up .  effectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies .  they are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie's success .  to amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man's seemingly-strange "" rituals "" .  the larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity .  as the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as "" sub-human , "" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense .  the abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property .  in a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything .  amistad's presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history .  four claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them .  baldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque .  even though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate .  aside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch .  matthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his "" pretty boy "" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case .  likewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than "" abolitionists . ""  nigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election .  finally , there's anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done .  hopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams .  his ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable .  one point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler's list is this film's lack of a well-defined human villain .  schindler's list had ralph fiennes' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for .  there is no such figure in amistad .  the villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary .  it is to spielberg's credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist .  amistad's trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident .  an opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 , 1997 .  numerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves .  it remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg's rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history .

1|"you know you're in for a truly different cinematic experience the moment you realize steve buscemi has been cast as the movie in question's most normal character .  such is the case with "" the big lebowski , "" joel and ethan coen's first venture since their "" fargo "" nabbed nationwide acclaim and a mantlepiece of academy award nods .  there's no need to fear that the coens suffered creative burnout with that accomplishment , because "" lebowski "" is an effort that makes words like "" strange "" and "" unusual "" seem like an understatement .  thanks in part to delicious characterization and an all-encompassing sense of humor , the film is a smashing success .  the central oddball here is the dude ( jeff bridges ) , an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot , drinking beer and going bowling ( are you college students already rooting for him , or what ? ) .  one night , a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet , a threatening act that's supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire ( david huddleston ) who shares his birth name -- jeff lebowski -- with the dude .  once the dude realizes this coincidence , he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug , and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter ( john goodman ) , a hotheaded vietnam vet , and donny ( buscemi ) , a mild-mannered surfer , before too long .  soon , though , lebowski's trampy trophy wife bunny ( tara reid ) is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom , and he turns to the dude for help .  it seems bunny's troubles are related to a line of work she's kept secret from her husband -- she's actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn .  the dude , now on lebowski's payroll , accepts the offer and agrees to handle the money drop ; walter tags along and insists that the dude keep the cash for himself .  chaos obviously ensues , and the dude eventually finds himself in hot water with cops , crooks and lebowski's ultra-eccentric artist daughter maude ( julianne moore ) .   "" the big lebowski "" deserves to win the coens the same amount of acclaim that "" fargo "" did ; while that 1996 black comedy was certainly a better film , "" lebowski "" is at least as breathtakingly imaginative .  the movie boasts a mile-high absurdity level that sometimes threatens to topple over , but thankfully never does .  the coens ( joel directed , ethan produced and both wrote ) keep you in stitches as they unravel their exceedingly loopy tale , and must be commended for juggling a number of people and subplots one would expect to find in a robert altman flick .  whether we're watching bridges fend off a marmet in his bathtub or moore don viking duds and dance in a busby berkeley-esque dream sequence , "" the big lebowski "" is immensely lively .  there are those who will dislike this film , but not because it's boring .  the cast has a great deal of fun with the bounteous material they're given .  bridges exudes a likeable , surprisingly sweet presence ; his dude sure isn't the cleanest guy around , but you'd still follow him to another movie .  goodman merits 1998's first oscar consideration , as walter's manic temper is one of "" the big lebowski "" 's many highlights ; the same goes for moore , whose throaty , delectable performance as maude is a hilarious hoot .  john turturro may very well steal the movie with his two scenes as a colorful bowler from a rival faction .  sam elliott's rambling narration gets the film off to a solid start .  and some will recognize peter stormare -- "" fargo "" 's silent heavy -- as carl hungus , a porn star who's really a samurai sword-wielding german nihilist and has-been pop star .  only in its final third does the movie falter , with a couple of loose plot threads and some cast members who quickly disappear and never emerge for a curtain call .  these flaws are forgivable , though -- the coens have crafted a tale so rich with personality that it's hard to look at the final product with anything but a big grin on your face .  without a doubt , "" the big lebowski "" is the best film so far this year .  sure , we're only three months in and the competition ( "" deep rising , "" "" desperate measures , "" "" the wedding singer , "" etc . ) has been pretty bland , but it's still the gospel truth .  maybe during next awards season , "" lebowski "" won't be a far cry from "" fargo .

1|"a couple of months ago , when i first downloaded the face/off trailer from the net , my initial reaction was a fourteen carrot gold 'yawn' .  followed swiftly by a press of my computers delete key , not wanting to waste six or seven megabytes of precious space on this piss-poor trailer .  then i started reading the first wave of reviews from the u . s . . . . . unique . . . excellent . . . . must-see .  well , i thought still skeptical , i suppose i might as well go see it when it gets here .  'here' , of course , was still three months away .  i'll admit , when i trotted off to see this film , the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow .  i'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled , but his films were definitely not on my must-see list .  that , let me tell you , has changed completely .  i knew this fact only five minutes into the film , after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet .  the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick .  seriously .  i've never been a big john travolta fan , but he , like cage , perfectly suited his role in the movie . . . . . sorry ,  make that 'roles' in the movie .  even travolta's great performance , however , paled in comparison to cage's character portrayals .  my favourite cage scene was definitely when he was crashed out in compardre dietrich hassler's hideout .  half drugged out of his mind , he sits there reclining back in a chair talking about his son's death from castor's perspective - "" doesn't it just break your heart . "" he mutters coldly .  now don't go thinking from the previous comments about brilliant acting that this is a drama focused movie - it's not .  that's what really makes this movie unique .  it's an action movie with brilliantly portrayed characters . . . . . not a common mix at all .  suspension of disbelief is paramount in this movie though . . . . . that's  the only way to overlook the fact that travolta and cage fire around 5671 rounds at each other . . . . and  never hit .  several action scenes are just so well choreographed that they just make wish that you could press 'rewind' and watch it over again .  the part where archer and troy have a stand off on either side of a double-sided mirror is just plain brilliant .  whilst cage's and travolta's performances would be enough alone to sustain most movies , the lesser characters are just as intriguing .  joan allen , who usually sticks to the straight drama movies , plays her part perfectly as archer's long suffering wife .  i like the fact that her character didn't end up toting a gun at the end of the movie . . . it  would have wrecked her potrayal .  gina gershon was surprising to say the least as castor troy's mistreated girlfriend . . . . . make that * one of * castor troy's mistreated girlfriends .  other movies would have used her character as just window dressing . . . a  sex object , but instead her character is very strong and independent .  dominique swain , who plays archer's daughter , also does a nice job , though her character is not as explored as much as allen's or gershon's .  faults ? well . . . there were some i have to say .  first , the movie's ending , whilst being very good overall , was a bit too drawn out for it's own good .  after the two combatants begin duelling again after the final boat crash you can't help but think - "" geez , are you guys nuclear powered or what ? "" .  there were certain bits that weren't handled properly , like where archer appears safe and sound on solid ground after jumping off the converted oil platform/prison - more explanation here would have been nice .  overall , this movie was not perfect .  but i thought it was about as close as an action movie has ever came to perfect .  many critics have claimed that this movie will change the way action movies are made . . . . . i  certainly hope so .

1|once again , the battle is dreamworks versus disney : earlier this year , the mammoth companies fought to the death with their end-of-the-world asteroid flicks , deep impact and armageddon .  here we are now , just a few months later , and they're at it again with dueling bug movies , antz and a bug's life .  what i find so astonishing is that both pairs of movies are so inherently similar in both story and execution .  i mean , come on -- what were the chances of two studios both deciding to bring out computer-animated films about bugs ?  as was the case with the meteor movies , disney has come out on top : though antz is a likable movie , a bug's life is far superior .  in fact , this movie made me realize what was wrong with antz : i became immersed in the world of a bug's life , while antz just made me scrutinize everything .  but it's not really fair to base an entire review on a comparison .  a bug's life is a remarkable film in its own right , and deserves to be seen apart from any other computer-animated film about bugs .  in fact , it's one of the best films this year : it's smart , subtle , and funny , but it's also perfect family entertainment and relentlessly entertaining .  i haven't had such a good time at the movies in months .  it tells the story of an ant named flick ( voice by dave foley ) ; he's a nice guy , but he's also a troublemaker .  the ants spend all season putting together the offering , a big pile of food that they provide for the grasshoppers .  just before the grasshoppers come , flick accidentally knocks over the offering , and ruins everything for the entire colony : the grasshopper's leader , hopper ( kevin spacey ) , is enraged , and tells them that the ants need twice the food by the end of summer , or they're all dead .  flick , feeling responsible for this , sets off to look for help -- he realizes that the only way to be rid of the grasshoppers is to fight them .  he heads to the city ( the city being a house a few miles away ) , where he finds a colorful bunch of circus bugs : a ladybug ( denis leary , who is spectacular ) , a black widow ( bonnie hunt ) , a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) , a butterfly ( madeline kahn ) , a rhinoceros beetle ( michael mcshane ) , and a stick ( david hyde-pierce , also giving a hilarious performance ) .  flick doesn't know they're actors , and they don't know that flick needs them to kill a bunch of grasshoppers , so they return to the colony with flick and find themselves in an unusual position .  the most obvious element of a bug's life is the quality of animation .  created by pixar , the same people who brought us toy story , a bug's life has some of the most amazing visuals i've ever seen .  the bugs seem to inhabit a three-dimensional space , and occasionally there will be a shot that is indistinguishable from live action .  this is a lush , colorful world , full of life and imagination : the way the animators insert the things all of us see in our daily lives ( matches , bottlecaps , tin cans , etc . ) and make them active objects in the bugs' world is innovative .  the film is also mercilessly exciting , particularly in a superbly-staged scene involving our heroes' escape from a bird ( a little bird never seemed so huge and threatening ) .  but the makers of a bug's life know where the importance lies : story and characters .  flick , with solid voice work from foley , is a great guy to lead the story .  but the real treat comes with the circus bugs ; they're such a likable group of characters -- the standouts are the stick ( hyde-pierce is so good ) , francis the ladybug , and the big fat caterpillar .  all of these bugs have more than a token personality , which makes the suspenseful scenes work because we care about the bugs , and it also keeps the tear-jerking scenes from seeming obligatory .  in my review of antz , i said that the film is a clever cop-out because it presents a bunch of little humans reacting to an ant-like existence .  in concept , a bug's life is basically the same movie , except that i was never given enough time to find things that i didn't like about it .  with such strong work in both animation and script , a bug's life is nothing but a joy to sit through .  it really is too bad that it had to come out so close to that other bug movie , but a bug's life is so good that i'm sure it will find its audience .  after a slew of endlessly violent and cynical movies , it's downright refreshing to sit through an innocent picture like this and laugh without feeling guilty .  |0.7666666666666666|0.9|0.9333333333333332|"The explanations describe ""A Bug's Life"" as a remarkable, smart, and funny movie that is perfect family entertainment.

1|"eight years after its release , disney has decided to re-release the little mermaid theatrically for 17 days ( and 17 long nights ) only .  coincidentally , it was reintroduced to theaters the same day fox's animated film anastasia was released .  you know disney , they can't deal with the threat of any other studio getting even a small piece of the crust of the kiddie entertainment pie , so when someone else wants to make a little money , they counter with an old "" masterpiece "" from their vault and , you know what , i went to see this 1989 cartoon rather than the brand new one from fox .  let no one say disney is losing its monopoly on the market .  they still have hotels on boardwalk _and_ park place .  believe it or not , today , november 25 , 1997 , at 5 : 05 p . m . , i saw the little mermaid for the first time .  it took me a few years to get over an aversion to this movie that was caused seven years ago , when i stayed with one of my mom's friends for a couple weeks .  they had a young child who listened to the little mermaid soundtrack constantly and , over that two week period , i heard every song from the movie probably a hundred times .  by the time i got back home , i promised myself i'd never see the movie .  but promises are made to be broken , especially when you're looking at a 17-day , limited engagement .  damn those shrewd disney marketers and their mind games .  the little mermaid is based on a hans christian anderson fairy tale , but it's disney-ized , which means lots of talking animals and bursting into song .  it also means the heroine is a total babe who shows off cleavage from a seashell bra at all times .  i never wanted so much to be a pair of shells . . .  the heroine , of course , is ariel ( voice of jodi benson ) , a 16-year-old mermaid who is going through that rebellious phase .  she skips her concert to explore a wrecked ship and hang out with a seagull that talks like buddy hackett , who tries to orient her to the mysterious world of humans .  she's also dealing with feelings she hasn't had before -- which comes when you get scales in places you didn't use to have them -- about a handsome prince ( no disney movie would be complete without one ) .  her father , king triton of the merpeople , strictly forbids such lusting after the ways of the "" savage "" humans , in a condemnation that reads as a not-so-subtle analogy about old- fashioned parents who forbid interracial dating .  what's a king to do , though ?  the girl's in love and even total destruction of her little shrine to the human world doesn't deter her .  ariel saves the prince's life when a hurricane rises up , and just has to meet him .  she makes a deal with ursula , the sea witch ( voice of pat carroll ) .  you know she's evil because she has a huge potbelly and one of the worst asses in cartoon history .  she also has octopus tentacles for feet ( something those dr . scholl's corn pads will not fix ) and offers to help ariel out .  she'll make her a human for three days if ariel will give up her pretty voice ; ariel has three days to make that prince kiss her , or else she becomes a slave to the witch forever .  and if she pricks her finger on a sewing machine or eats an evil apple , she'll fall asleep forever .  it's a simplistic plot , yes , but the little mermaid was a revolution in the disney world , coming after such lackluster efforts as the black cauldron and oliver and company .  it ranks as one of the best disney cartoons , certainly since the '50s .  all the elements are there -- memorable songs like "" under the sea "" and "" kiss the girl , "" cartoon animals like sebastian and flounder , an evil villain who still has characterization and charm , and a fair amount of humor that caters to adults as well as children .  the little mermaid is worth a big-screen ticket in 1997 , so hurry up , you only have five days left .  serving america for more than 1/25th of a century !

""  she must carry a rosary in her pocket at all times .  the richly acted film is written and directed by thom fitzgerald in a quirky but loving style .  although some may refer to the film as yet another dysfunctional family picture , that moniker misses the mark .  yes , every member of the household has their own special problems , but the writer didn't choose to name so many characters for various flowers by accident .  this delightful little picture mixes love , tragedy and pathos , resulting in a hopeful and almost magical concoction .  during the opening credits we observe the boy , sweet william , at the center of the story .  first , he's an average sized young lad who is slapped off-screen by his father .  next , he's 300 pound teenager , played with hopelessness and depression by troy veinotte .  when the opening credits end , we cut to 10 years later .  william is now an average-sized , reasonably happy adult , played with love and compassion by chris leavins .  william has returned after 10 years absence to attend the marriage of his free-spirited and foul-mouthed sister rosemary to his first childhood lover , fletcher ( joe s . keller ) .  kerry fox from an angel at my table and shallow grave plays rosemary with a compelling joy .  nicole burnell , who gave such a devastating performance in the sweet hereafter , plays the teenage rosemary .  the father of the family , whiskey mac ( peter macneill ) , is an alcoholic autocrat who is more obnoxious than harmful .  his wife , iris ( seana mckenna ) , says that she would have left him years ago to at least go to some place warm were it not for her lack of money and her obligations to the kids .  rounding out the family is christine dunsworth as nine-year-old violet , the sister whom william meets for the first time .  as the exuberant irish music fills the air at the wedding in the family home , william wanders off to try on one of his old coats , which causes him to laugh at the size of his former self .  the director manages to stage simple scenes in wonderfully imaginative ways .  he takes a common wedding dress train and uses it to set up scenes in fresh and fascinating ways .  rosmary's trip to the bathroom after drinking too much beer is beautifully orchestrated , and kerry fox is at her hilarious best trying to cope with the long train in a small bath , all while talking to her brother .  as much as anything , the film is a series of character sketches .  in one of the strongest we watch william in a flashback as he has his first sexual encounter , a homosexual one .  although he is perfectly happy liking the same sex , his mother is aghast .  a woman friend of hers suggests she take william to a local housewife , dusty miller ( martha irving ) , who , for a fee , will have heterosexual sex with william .  with absolute finesse the director crafts a subtle scene that manages to yield significant emotional punch without being sensational .  dusty , after asking iris to watch her daughter , takes william and gently introduces him to the joys of sex with the opposite sex .  all of this notwithstanding , he still prefers males .  the film is at its most poignant in several sequences in which the grown william comes face-to-face with himself when younger .  this causes his ugly old memories to be reignited .  in the most devastating , he has to come to grips with his former self who was so overwhelmed with the stress that he tried to hang himself .  even here , the director touches your heart without ever letting the story dissolve into anything approaching a tearjerker .  the ultimate result is an uplifting story that has more hope that one would ever expect from the outline of its plot .  the hanging garden runs 1 : 31 .  it is rated r for strong sexuality , language , violence and some teen drug use and would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are quite old and mature .

1|" ( dimension films , "" scream 2 "" 's distributor , has asked press to say extremely little -- if anything -- about the film's twisty plot .  that's no easy task considering the wit that deserves to be mentioned here , but i will do my best to be vague ( now , there's a first ) . )   "" the first one was [good] , but all the rest sucked , "" said a cinematically-savvy teen in last winter's wes craven thriller "" scream , "" her statement referring to the films of the "" nightmare on elm street "" series but really putting down franchise overkill in general .  the comment certainly carries clout : for every truly great sequel , there appears to be a couple of duds , making one wonder if writers are better off sticking solely with fresh ideas .  but like it or not , along comes "" scream 2 . "" and believe it or not , it's a doozy -- a slick , sinister , madly subversive good time at the movies , as intent on sending up hollywood's sequel syndrome as much as its prequel poked fun at slasher conventions .   "" scream 2 "" is definitely that rare movie thing -- a follow-up that can stand along side its original with pride .  it's been two years since a pair of overzealous horror movie fans clad in edvard munch-esque get-ups carved their way through the young populace of woodsboro , california .  those surviving the ordeal have gotten on with their lives .  plucky heroine sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) is a drama student at the midwestern windsor college ; her pop culture-whiz pal randy meeks ( jamie kennedy ) has tagged along .  trash tabloid reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) has written a best-seller based on their ordeal , the basis of which has been turned into a ( very bad ) movie called "" stab . ""  and dewey riley ( david arquette ) , still suffering from wounds inflicted during "" scream , "" has left his job as a police officer for a while .  life is tranquil . . .  at least for a while .  several sudden murders bring sidney , randy , gale and dewey together again , but with suspicious eyes cast on each other and most of those in their surroundings -- if these four people learned anything from the past , it's to trust no one .  thus , the possible victim/potential killer list includes said quartet , as well as : derek ( jerry o'connell ) , sidney's new beau ; cici ( sara michelle gellar ) , a chatty sorority gal ; joel ( duane martin ) , gale's cameraman who's not too thrilled with her blood-soaked past ; hallie ( elise neal ) , sidney's sassy roommate ; debbie ( laurie metcalf ) , a local reporter who gives gale some not-too-friendly competition ; and mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , randy's good friend and fellow film student .  cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney wrongly accused of her mother's murder in scream , also shows up on campus -- but why ?  like the first scream , craven and screenwriter kevin williamson inaugurate things with a bang .  this time , it's an extended sequence that finds an african-american couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a sneak preview of "" stab , "" making sly references about everything from sandra bullock to the lunchmeat non-roles of blacks in slasher cinema .  before tragedy ensues at the screening , the movie-within-a-movie setup allows for plenty of jokey moments , including a scene from "" stab "" which turns scream's now-famous drew barrymore prologue on its ear .   ( "" b---- , hang up the phone and star-69 his a-- ! ""  pinkett yells at the screen . )  it's funny , creepy stuff ( i don't think i'll ever feel safe in a movie theater again ) that effectively foreshadows the ratio of smart scares and spoofy laughs down the road .  another flawless example of this is a riotous cell phone-assault of the killer on randy , dewey and gale in broad daylight ; it builds comedically and ends with genuine terror because of the emotional investment made on these delicious characters .  there are other superb set pieces , but explaining them risks ruining their effect .  there are more players this time around as to provide both a higher number suspects and a staggering body count .  it's something of a trade-in -- the new characters are too large in number to be as fully-developed as the original "" scream "" gang , but this movie packs in knowing performances ( especially by kennedy and cox ) and more death for your dollar .  it can be argued that , while the original might outclass it by a tad , scream 2 is both scarier and funnier .  it certainly doesn't skimp with shocks -- a major one being the killing of one cast member very near and dear to my heart ( i actually questioned craven and williamson's judgment here , considering how much this person has added to these films ) .  sometimes you wish that more could have been done with stab -- the two scenes we're shown are dead-on -- but for film fans , there are plenty of subtle nods to movies like "" the usual suspects , "" "" aliens "" and "" the empire strikes back . ""  still , "" scream 2 "" does so many things right , it's petty to quibble .  its penchant for parody is irresistible , discussions of the merits of film sequels and all .  the attractive , solid cast is a definite bonus .  and the denouement ( while not as shocking as "" scream "" 's ) is priceless ; the film's final revelation incorporates bits of a particular horror film prominently referred to in "" scream "" with one of the best bad guy motives ever put on paper .  all this and a "" scream 3 "" is in the works .  knowing the series' tendency for self-reference , perhaps one of its characters will again discuss the concept of sequel justice .  mentioning "" scream 2 "" 'll help them in their argument .

1|"edward zwick's "" the siege "" raises more questions than it can convincingly answer or even clearly articulate .  its subject is the rising threat of terrorism in american cities .  denzel washington is anthony "" hub "" hubbard , who runs the fbi's anti-terrorism task force in new york .  his investigation into arab terrorist cells intensifies when suicide bombers take out a busload of people .  hub focuses on a mysterious cia operative ( annette bening ) , whose goes by both "" elise "" and "" sharon .

"" siege "" avoids the tougher questions by endowing its hero , hub , with a uncompromising sense of clear right and wrong .  this comforting fantasy of sir galahad confronting the evils of the modern world is an escape from the thought-provoking issues the movie raises .  still , zwick deserves credit for at least addressing the issue with as much realism as he does where so many movies ( willis' "" die hard "" series , for example ) offer only a comic-book view on terrorism .

1|"go's is a gloriously slick hip machine .  director liman ( who also photographed go ) and screenwriter august celebrate the drug/rave scene in l . a . , preferring to take ( comedic ) snapshots of troubled youth rather than critique them .  after more than ninety minutes of pill-popping , tantric sex , car chases , and attempted murder , go even has a happy ending .  this is the sort of film that gives members of the dove foundation splitting headaches ; as go wound down , i anticipated an anti-pill-popping-casual-tantric-sex-car-chase-attempted-murder sermon that ( blessedly ) didn't arrive .  a la tarantino's pulp fiction , go is comprised of three separate but related stories .  the basics are as follows : ronna ( polley ) is a bitter grocery store clerk facing eviction who turns to drug dealing for extra dough .  her co-worker , simon ( the improbably named askew ) , is a clubber from britain ecstatic about his first trip to vegas .  zack ( mohr ) and adam ( wolf ) are soap opera stars escaping a career-threatening conviction by assisting a peculiar cop ( fichtner ) in a drug bust .  perhaps because the innovative structure of tarantino's non-linear masterwork is by now old hat , the id-fueled go delighted me but rarely surprised me ( with the exception of that mind-reading cat ! ) ;  pulp fiction zigzagged down roads unforeseen , but we see go's wheels turning from its first flash frame to the last .  torontonian polley ( of the sweet hereafter ) refused to do publicity for this picture on the basis that she was "" not pleased with "" her turn as the ill-fated cashier .  in go , she delivers , hands-down , her best performance to date .  here's an ( overrated ) actress who agreed to appear on the poster , but not support her team at the junket or in interviews ; this sort of arrogance is commonplace for ms . polley , as anyone who has read of her political agenda in the canadian press will tell you .  if she doesn't want to be the ingenue of the moment , she should have said "" no , "" not go .  but i digress .  go is a fun film , so chipperly depraved one can't help but turn off his moral judgment for its duration and enjoy the ride .  in that sense , it's a departure from liman's last film , swingers , which at least lectured against self-absorption in the form of vince vaughan's trent and his subtle comeuppance in the story's clever epilogue ( which has been aped by mcdonald's for their latest commercial ) .  i wish i cared more about go's characters : like the techno music they listen to , the bands of anarchists on display here are at once absorbing and vacuous .  when the lights came up and stung my eyes , it was difficult to recall what about it entertained me .  yet entertain me it did .  go is light and frothy , featuring compelling if not endearing work by polley , timothy olyphant ( scream 2 ) , and especially fichtner , whose homoerotic behavior is milked for effective laughs .  fichtner is a character actor best known for playing backstabbers ( in heat , armageddon , and others ) ; his previously untapped comic abilities shine in go .  unlike much of the film , fichtner is unpredictable .
