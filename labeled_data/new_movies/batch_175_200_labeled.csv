1|"capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops .  the first few minutes of sweet sweetback's baad asssss song ( yes , i checked -- that's the correct number of ss ) are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds .  a young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother-surrogate figures .  then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that's far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we're not used to seeing on screen .  this is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately .   ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences . )  the plot is simple but not simpleminded .  sweetback , hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man , breaks his bonds and runs like hell .  along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all , for that matter : the slums , the missions , the ghetto .  in other , lesser , movies , sweetback would be machine-gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies ; in this one , we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted .  ssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x ( "" by an all-white jury "" , as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns ) , and it's hardly surprising why .  there's a good deal of sex in the movie , but it's handled in a way that's unsettlingly frank -- a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie .  in one scene , sweetback visits a friend's house in the hope of getting sanctuary there , and the other man chats him up while on the toilet .  we're not used to coming this close to people in real life , let alone in the movies -- especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous .  the movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today , but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles' hands .  one scene , in which a man is interrogated by the cops , is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears , and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack .  another note : ssbas is not so much anti-white ( that would be too easy ) as anti-authority , and as the movie goes on to demonstrate , authority exists in many forms -- governments , churches , and even the paranoid inside of one's own mind .  ssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom -- and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet , god knows .

1|"a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july !  i didn't really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family .  the movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based .  my real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? )  i was surprised to discover a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film .  it is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture .  for those of you who don't know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc . although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , "" a graduate of several 12-step programs . ""  stuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles .  stuart's relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking .  then , disaster strikes .  stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked .  he is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself , and there the comedy truly picks up .  franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes , but as sharply-drawn , real people .  although smalley's dad has always imbibed too much , stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy .  also , after an accident towards the end of the movie , both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought .  although filled with small , very funny scenes , stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments , especially towards the conclusion .  for a lightweight comedy , it handles these scenes especially well , often better than many so-called "" serious dramas "" of today .  all the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit .  if you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven't seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out .  you'll laugh . . . you'll  cry . . . . it's  all there .

""  marty , you see , is a grown-up twin .  although his sister , who thinks she is jackie-o , is certifiably insane , marty fits right in with the rest of this highly dysfunctional family in the witty black comedy the house of yes .  mother and daughter , played in a brilliant performance by parker posey , are both varying degrees of wacko .  most dysfunctional families in the movies are more angry and mean-spirited than diabolically abnormal as this one is .  the daughter's fantasy of being jackie-o is probably the most sane part of her being .  mrs . pascal is the sort that will not let jackie-o keep a hairbrush downstairs since food is kept on that level .  she explains to marty's new fiancee , lesly ( tori spelling ) , soon after their first meeting that jackie-o was holding marty's private part when she came out of the womb .  the dialog by wendy macleod , based on the play by mark waters , is so sharp and biting that it seems in danger of cutting through the celluloid at any moment .  the script , reminiscent of a david mamet play , flows smoothly with its fast paced intelligence and mesmerizing set of bizarre characters .  the exaggerated setup has lesly and marty arriving at the family's out of the way mansion during a thanksgiving day hurricane .  in this storm are two sane individuals .  the fiancee is a giddy , school-girl type , embarrassed by everything , a complete contrast to her rival jackie-o's bitter pseudo-sophistication .  as the two twins' younger brother , anthony , freddie prinze jr . plays the all-america boy type whose only foible is his explicit obsession of bedding his brother's fiancee that night .

( when lesly calls it the family's "" home "" to mrs . pascal -- they've never had a visitor before lesly -- mrs . pascal becomes discombobulated until she realizes that lesly is talking about their "" house .

"" were you poor ? ""  jackie-o asks her when she finds that lesly committed the crime of growing up impoverished .   "" did you eat pies ?  chicken pot pies ? ""   "" pancakes actually , lots of pancakes , "" lesly replies with her usual sincerity .   "" a donut king , so is she like the queen ? , ""  jackie-o cattily inquires of marty when she learns that lesly works at a donut king .   "" are we entertaining royalty ? ""  with rolfe kent's whimsically sinister music it never seems clear where the story is headed .  will it end in a big emotional explosion , a murder , people slowly cutting each other up with words , a familial catharsis , a weather disaster or what ?  the emotionally charged play is clearly going somewhere , and the engaging characters captivate the audience with their spell .  i'll not say more except that the ending is perfect and a bit of a surprise .  the house of yes runs a blazing fast 1 : 25 .  it is rated r for sexual situations and conversations , mature themes , violent overtones and some profanity .  the movie would be fine for older and mature teenagers , i . e . , treat the movie as it were rated nc-17 .

1|"i don't know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it's something i used to wonder about when i was younger .  i can't decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i'm pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought .  the truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public .  since birth , he's been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla . , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign .  all the people in truman burbank's life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras .  people watch truman's life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions .  revenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman's friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones .  the sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else .  even if you haven't seen the truman show , you've probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes .  if anything i've written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news .  either way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you'll probably think it sucks .  it begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial "" eat me "" scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney ) .  but weird things start happening .  a stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father .  we learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm .  the death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island .  similar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman's best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he's not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he'd ever do is hurt him .  as truman's trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else .  there's even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman's existence .  the key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions .  and it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on .  he's come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura .  most fundamentally , it's just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person's life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors .  the most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this .  sure , the most interesting tv genre of the '90s has been reality programming and jerry springer's popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves .  and when news shows use hidden cameras , it's done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment .  but merge the two and you've got the truman show .  right now , it's implausible -- i mean , the fcc won't let you say the s-word on the air ; do you think they'd let you broadcast every detail of a man's life to the entire world without his consent ?  one day , though , it could happen .  and , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up .  you know they would .

1|"no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan .  i'm referring , specifically , to the narrative form .  in the sweet hereafter , egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster .  said story , of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent , british columbia , that shatters the morale of the locals , is told in a most unstraightforward manner .  when the film opens , the accident has already happened , and stephens ( the wonderful holm ) , a polite ambulance-chaser , has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning .  throughout , we get to meet the parents of the dead , broken souls who follow stephens like "" the pied piper "" ( passages of which are read during the film ) .  but there is one living passenger , the paralyzed nicole ( polley ) , whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify .  we finally do see the accident , about three quarters into the film , which is a stunning visual effect .  a horrific long take that shows the bus sliding , then stopping , then collapsing into a frozen lake , is the best digital trickery in any movie this year and , perhaps , ever , in a motion picture .  the fractured narrative also intercuts a preoccupied stephens on an airplane , traveling to meet his hiv-positive runaway daughter , as well as glimpses of the artificially happy lives these people led pre-accident .  i have a problem not with the story or story structure , but with egoyan's heavy- handedness behind the camera .  for the first hour or so , i can quite honestly say i was on the verge of tears ; these are miserable , miserable people .  but that's just the problem : so anguished are these folk that sympathy wanes after a while , when a lot of sadness becomes too much .  also , a subplot involving incest rings untrue .  perhaps it wouldn't feel so contrived if it weren't shot in such a tasteful manner .  there are two characters who are father and daughter ; when they first appeared i thought they were lovers .  i was half-right .  nevertheless it's worth-seeing .  the delightful critic geoff pevere recently wrote that "" american films are about action , canadian films are about consequences , "" hence a recent wave of films about the effects of shock and death from toronto directors , including crash and kissed .  the sweet hereafter is much better than either of these two films , simply because it's not boring or , in the case of kissed , afraid of its own material ( necrophilia ) .  egoyan is a fine , fine , postmodern storyteller , whose work is entertaining , edgy and smart , if a bit too intellectual at times .  though i harped on the weightiness of the material , i was always absorbed , engrossed , and surprised by the sweet hereafter .

1|i know what i would do with $4 . 4 million if i found it in a previously undiscovered airplane crash site , especially if i were with jacob and lou .   ( huh ? )  well , in any event , that is the situation hank ( paxton ) finds himself in .  he and his dim-witted brother jacob ( thorton ) and tubby friend lou ( brent briscoe ) come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck .  against his better judgement , hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities .  the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret , and is it worth it ?  a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things , clay pigeons and even fargo , and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle .  oh , and its much better than any of those .  sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak-show horror-monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture .  he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do .  i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course .  one of the film's components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick's the thin red line .  in malick's three hour bore-a-thon , he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story .  it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass , a small bird , or a flowing body of water .  sure , there were obvious metaphorical connections , but there was no subtlty to his efforts .  raimi does a fine job of tying in a fox in a chicken coop and birds of prey to signify the future of the characters .  i think most viewers may miss the comparison , but it is a very intriguing ingredient in the film .  and then there's billy bob thorton , who is proof that the independent film industry is vital to the life blood of hollywood .  if it can continute to produce people like thorton , hollywood will be ok .  he gives a fantastic and devastatingly deep performance here .  it is not as engrossing as his carl childers character in slingblade , but is is just as complex , if not more so .  jacob is slow and simple , and yet we so often see him deep in thought .  i wondered if he was thinking about things that he would never say ( or didn't know how to say ) or if he was just taking a long time to think about the thing he just said .  here he really proves his worth as one of the best character actors in the industry .  though the plot is somewhat unoriginal , it has a very appealing new twist in its characters .  paxton gives one of the better performances of his career as the straight and serious leader of the group ( a far cry from chet in wierd science ) .  perhaps bridget fonda is miscast as his advice-giving wife , but she certainly doesn't do anything ruin the picture .  a simple plan can be included in the group of recent small hollywood films that is just dark and pretty un-redeeming .  but at least this one has an important message , unlike so many of its counterparts .  |0.08333333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.7000000000000001|"The overall sentiment of the text leans slightly toward negativity, as it mentions negative elements such as finding a large bag of cash and keeping it instead of going to the authorities, and questioning who will die to keep it a secret, while also mentioning that the film is ""dark"" and ""un-redeeming.""

1|"i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater , on a sunday afternoon .  when the movie was over and the audience was exiting , i didn't hear one negative comment , and i didn't have any to offer .  simon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys , simon ( ian michael smith ) and joe ( joseph mazzello ) , and what destiny holds for both of them .  simon is a dwarf , who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart .  surprisingly , he does , and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle .  simon thinks god has a plan for him , a purpose for his life , and his condition , he just doesn't know what .  joe is an illegitimate child ( referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard ) , who's mom ( ashley judd ) won't tell him who his father is .  simon has more than just dwarfism as a problem , the people in the town don't really like him , because he isn't "" natural "" .  even his own parents don't care about him , and are disappointed they didn't have a "" normal "" son .  he is also harassed in church by the local pastor , rev . russell ( david strathairn ) and simon's chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks .  the only person , other than joe , that really cares for simon is joe's mom , who he also looks up to as a mother .  it would be just simon's luck , that he would accidentally kills joe's mom , something you are told at the beginning of the movie .  joe , now motherless as well as fatherless , feels the need to find out who his real father is .  with the help of ben ( oliver platt ) , the local drama teacher and joe's mom's current boyfriend ( before her death ) , he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way .  most of this trouble is laugh out loud funny , although not all of it is .  simon will also look for god's plan for him , although he loses a little faith along the way .  starring in the first ( and last ) five minutes of the film is hollywood's newest dramatic actor , jim carrey .  jim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off , and then tying it up just right .  this is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway , and he does a commendable job .  simon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson , this is his first film as director , but he has written several films , including the grumpy old men series .  he does an outstanding writing and directing job here , the film's structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly .  the dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat .  the cast is excellent .  joseph mazzello gives the stand out performance .  joseph is outstanding for someone of any age , not alone someone who just turned 15 .  ian michael smith , in his film debut , has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation .  other great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast .  i loved this movie , it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year .  take your whole family to see simon birch , it is a magnificent film- an american masterpiece .

1|the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways .  in this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others .  this movie closely resembles a james bond flick .  it has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal .  kilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations .  the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests .  as a young boy , kilmer's character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork .  that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint .  he refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be .  this leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life .  kilmer's first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija .  during a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles .  once his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid .  when he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire .  dr . emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion .  this new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia , where millions are without heat and are freezing to death .  the only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people .  this presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal .  tretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue .  one of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions .  they are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us .  kilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue's character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula .  when the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer's character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer's alter-ego , a traveling artist .  yet , he must reach his goal of $50 million , which requires him to steal the energy formula , putting his feelings aside .  shue's character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together , something no one else is able to do .  when she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak .  the saint is very action-packed , with few slow points .  the sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments .  along the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy .  these moments are almost always thanks to kilmer's extraneous , very convincing disguises and personalities .  all in all , a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non-stop action .  |0.6441666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive.

""  sometimes it was hard to believe that this story , with terrible dialogue , some bad acting , especially from craig bierko , and scenes that go absolutely nowhere , are actually true .  i know this isn't a true story or anything , but a film should be able to make you think that it is .  on the plus side of acting , we get to see the missing from main character action since the film masterpiece shine in 1995 actor , armin mueller-stahl .  in the thirteenth floor , he is back and is still giving believable and amazing performances .  another plus is gretchen mol's realistic performance , creating her character with depth , not just staying in the one-dimensional phase .  don't expect the intensity of the matrix or existenz to come out of the thirteenth floor , just expect another film that messes with your mind for awhile , and shuts you down like any other movie would .  thrills , chills , and spills aren't what you will get in this film , but you will just get another trip to send your mind on , scrambling it until you've had enough .  the bottom line- let's hope this is the last of the "" reality check "" based movies for awhile .

1|i've never been a member of the robin williams fan club .  a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i'm watching a 40-year-old class clown .  in his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances .  mrs .  doubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet .  while it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs .  doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy .  williams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior .  one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce .  unemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda's ad for an afternoon housekeeper .  he turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman .  daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda's flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best .  mrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so .  the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that's instantly believable .  it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman's dorothy michaels look like milton berle .  more problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it's a bit hard to swallow that she doesn't recognize any of the voices as her husband's .  perhaps the biggest contrivance we're asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes .  there's more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask .  fortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll .  during the film , i was generally too busy laughing .  after getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams' riffing , mrs .  doubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place .  daniel's frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away .  clearly , most of the credit for doubtfire's success goes to robin williams .  it took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn't just robin williams with a different name .  he thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed .  wisely , he never aims for saintly .  his responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity .  it's one of mrs .  doubtfire's charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better .  as miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu .  the children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest .  the supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing .  it's easy to see mrs .  doubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it's true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common .  but mrs .  doubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge's decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda's relationship .  there's nothing dazzlingly new in mrs .  doubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply .  and it's nice to see robin williams just act for a change .  |-0.012333333333333326|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|"The sentiment of the text leans towards being positive, with the reviewer praising ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" as an engaging and hilarious comedy, while acknowledging its implausibilities.

1|"weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them .  in the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out .  it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank .  by now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants .  `seahaven' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras .  for 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we're given , ' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him .  thus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program .  in a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through .  this allows us to comprehend and accept truman's world before we contextualize it .  for all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it .  truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed .  the surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment .  cinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images .  as well , it employs wojciech kilar's piece "" zycie za zycie' masterfully and beautifully .  if the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney's characterization as meryl , truman's "" wife "" ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman's `father' , which feels curiously incomplete .  there are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman's audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film .  they wear buttons asking `how will it end ?

1|"part one of "" the strangest movies ever made "" series at www . mediajunkies . com  by scott watson  [light spoilers , nothing you shouldn't read]  existenz has been called "" a gooey matrix "" , and while this is a correct description in some ways , in others it is completely off .  the only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal , "" real "" reality .  a major difference is that "" the matrix "" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality , while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true .  and oh what a reality it is .  david cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies ( naked lunch , crash ) , but this one is one of the strangest .  maybe it's because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre .  technology is organic , but only some of it .  cars are normal .  gas stations are the same .  cell phones are glowing bug like appendages .  you jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus ( referred to simply as a "" pod "" ) .  high technology has been replaced with organic creatures , and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters .  a famous game designer , allegra geller ( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh ) , flees a demonstration of her latest game , existenz , after an assassination attempt .  she is on the run ( from who , i'm still not sure ) , and has to save her pod by playing her game with "" someone friendly "" .  that someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard , ted pikul ( jude law ) .  unfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing , a bioport .  sort of a hole in your spine ( ok , exactly like a hole in your spine ) , a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail-looking wires from the pod into you , allowing you to play the game .  luckily a bioport can be installed easily ( they install them in malls ) , so off they go to get one .  after a crazy series of events at the local country gas station , they are able to plug in and play existenz .  the plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies , reality distortion , chinese restaurants , and multi appendaged amphibian things ( "" it's a sign of the times "" ) .  but the plot , while cohesive in it's own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe .  cronenberg just slaps this weird organic-tech world into the viewers lap , and it's up to you to figure out how all these things work .  and that's the true joy of this film , entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place .  you learn a little bit piece by piece ( oh , they make pods out of those ) , and it's just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you .  there are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around , including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards .  also the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz , the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover .  there's lots of little things that set off the weird-o-meter , like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store , the two headed amphibian creature , and why that guy at the gas station's name appears to be "" gas "" .  it all adds up to a supremely far out trip , and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrix's virtual world . . .  oh wait , i already do .

1|good films are hard to find these days .  great films are beyond rare .  proof of life , russell crowe's one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems .  a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true .  consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world .  i haven't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah's masterpiece , the getaway .  but enough with the gossip , let's get to the review .  the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers .  upon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million .  the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money .  with no choice available to her , bowman's wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband .  but when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands .  the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors .  the script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil's advocate and dolores claiborne .  the biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso .  dug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe's right hand gun while providing most of the film's humor .  ryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne .  the most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes .  the bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story's characters .  the scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise .  director taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film .  proof of life is a thinking man's action movie .  it is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night .  |0.3499999999999999|0.8500000000000001|0.8000000000000002|"The overall sentiment is slightly negative due to initial comments about the scarcity of good films, but is mostly positive due to the review of ""Proof of Life"" as a rare gem with strong acting, intelligent script, masterful directing, well-written dialogue, and skillfully crafted action scenes."
1|"i must admit i'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend .  the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity .  i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film .  maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy .  maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin .  but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life .  the story of serendipity is simple .  two people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle .  charmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink .  but with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera .  sara declares that if this "" thing "" -- let's just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future .  years later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts .  what happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that "" thing "" was right after all .  fortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative .  coupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity .  both piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters  on the flipside , films such as you've got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film's main journey at hand .  but it's what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture .

1|in some regards , making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it .  try too hard , and it snaps ; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther .  in simon birch , director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique : he takes advantage of caution and poise , but also risks his movie with a few bold steps .  in the end , he's not only holding an unbroken band , but he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature .  there's no doubt about it : the film that johnson has crafted is rich .  he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown , maine - leaves turn bright orange in the fall , the grass is a lush green , pure white snow falls in the winter , and the sky goes on forever .  the characters continue that turn : our two leads are simon birch ( ian michael smith ) and joe wenteworth ( joseph mazzello ) .  simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital , and by age twelve he's only two feet tall .  joe is the bastard son of rebecca ( ashley judd ) , and by age twelve he's ready to know who is father is .  naturally , the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together , from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball .  in a wonderfully executed performance by ian michael smith , simon birch is convinced that he's god's instrument , and there must be a reason he's so small .  joe doesn't quite buy it , but he sticks by simon ; the two tough it out through the worst of times and are each other's only true friends .  early on , the two meet up with ben goodrich ( oliver platt ) , rebecca's new boyfriend , and although the bond isn't immediate , ben and the two boys develop a liking for each other .  both platt and judd give solid performances that lend their characters a deep likeability .  the audience cares about them as much as they do about joe and simon , a testament to the acting jobs of both .  finally , jim carrey gives a cameo as the adult joe in the present day , and his few minutes here are relatively more impressive than his entire performance in the truman show .  mark steven johnson's sense of drama and writing is fantastic .  the script is loosely based on john irving's novel , a prayer for owen meany , but it's so far off the source material that irving actually requested the credits be changed from 'based on' to 'suggested by . '  along those same lines , it's almost unfitting to compare the two ; johnson uses tension , humor , atmosphere , and suspense to create an original drama of forrest gumpian proportions .  by no means has he developed a project of similar popularity - gump made over 300 million dollars while birch ought to pass out of sight in a few weeks - but the winning idea remains the same .  simon birch is a different look at a different life , and one that will most likely be studied in film school classes in decades to come .  in the present , however , it's an enjoyable little picture that everyone ought to take a look at .  |0.7666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.9|The film is praised for its masterful technique, rich setting, likable characters, and solid performances, with the potential to be studied in film school classes in the future.

""  another scene involves roth's lengthy manufactured story about running into a group of cops and a police dog in a bus station bathroom while carrying a giant bag of marijuana .  neither of these have much plot relevance but are given ample time to develop , like the captain koons gold watch speech in pulp fiction , only here these sequences are more enjoyable than the rest of the movie .  reservoir dogs is good but it's no pulp fiction .

1|it's a fact that a good thriller or action movie doesn't need violence to be good or worth watching .  all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails .  and what kind of violence could be more efficient than a global thermo-nuclear war ?  and potential violence is the premiss wargames is built upon .  a computer whiz-kid , david , is usually contended with hacking into the school computer to change his grades .  but after having read an advertisment for an upcoming computer game , he wants to be the first to play it .  instead of getting into the computer at protovision software he accidentally comes to the frontgate of norad .  with the help of jennifer , a girl in his biology class , he starts to play a nice game of nuclear war with wopr , war operation plan response ( a top-notch computer at the time , but now hardly faster than my own computer )  i remember being 12 and watching this at the cinema .  it was very efficent at giving you a scare in those days and that hasn't changed .  of course , a nuclear war seemed to be much more of something that could actually happen back in 1983 .  i wouldn't be surprised if this gave people nightmares .  i hope it still does since you still hear about school kids hacking into the computers at pentagon .  broderick and sheedy are just fine as the young teenagers ( although her interest in david remains a mystery ) .  but the rest of the actors are , by no fault of their own , restricted by the script to play one-dimensional grownups .  david's parents are the same kind of parents that populate all these college comedies from the 1980s , movies like secret admirer , porky's or zapped and the norad general beringer is straight out of dr . strangelove .  if for no other reason , you should see this movie to enjoy how far the computer technology has gone since those days .  david uses the same telephone for calling friends as calling other computers .  the modem is some kind of device that he puts the headset on .  far from any 56k modem my guess is that it's some kind of 2400 bps modem , the kind of technology you now find at your local technical museum .  the big computer at norad has a lot of flashing lights ( just like those you see on star trek or any old sf-movie ) but it's hardly impressing compared with what you can get today .  what are the lessons we can learn from wargames ?  1 .  make sure there are no secret backdoors into military computers .  2 . thank you , whoever it was , for giving us a graphical user interface when we use our computers !  |-0.3|0.7666666666666666|0.7999999999999999|The overall sentiment of the explanations is negative, with mentions of violence, a global thermo-nuclear war, restricted actors, and outdated technology contributing to this sentiment.
1|there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie .  action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle .  for fans of both genres , however , realism is key .  action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end .  on this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr .  moreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin .  the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years .  the script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago .  a certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times .  frankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck .  his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it .  robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time .  he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package .  the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik .  at times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk .  fortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened .  the action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews .  the only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness .  ronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots .  the suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open .  considering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it's another good bet this month .  since quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it's definitely worth the visit .  |0.10000000000000002|0.7333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly positive, noting the praise for the realism and intrigue in the movie ""Ronin"", as well as the impressive action content and Robert De Niro's performance.

1|"jay and silent bob strike back , kevin smith's swan song to his two most famous characters , is the best received comedy that i've seen since there's something about mary , which is a tea party in comparison to the foul-mouthed humor in jay and silent bob strike back .  the audience didn't just laugh ; they went wild with boisterous laughter and heavy applause throughout .  in short , if you like really raunchy humor , you may find it , as i did , to be the funniest movie of the year .   ( on the other hand , if you are one of those who walked out in disgust with smith's dogma , then jay and silent bob strike back is not the movie for you . )  in one of the fastest paced movies of the year , the story has jay and silent bob ( jason mewes and kevin smith ) , a pair of card carrying drug dealers , traveling from their new jersey convenience store home to hollywood so that they can stop a movie .  it seems their comic book alter egos , bluntman and chronic , are being used in a movie without jay and silent bob's consent .  jason biggs and james van der beek are slated to star in it .  jay and silent bob strike back has more and better used cameos than just about any movie that i've ever seen .  among others , they include carrie fisher as a bible-toting nun , mark hamill as a comic book version of his famous alter ego and gus van sant as a director too busy counting his money to yell , "" action ! ""  best of all are ben affleck and matt damon who mock themselves and their movies .  the film stops several times to make fun of itself and of the audience who was "" stupid "" enough to buy tickets to this movie .   ( actually , purchasing tickets to this film is extremely smart given that it delivers more laughter per dollar than anything in recent memory . )  the film even skewers people who write about movies on the internet .  guilty .  although it's filled with inside jokes , you'll still be laughing even if you only get some of them .  it's easy to understand enough so that they are still funny .  jay is a motor mouth who hasn't met a subject that he couldn't vulgarize .  his favorite topic is oral sex , but , being an equal opportunity profaner , he's willing to make crude jokes about absolutely anything .  but it is his buddy , the aptly named silent bob , who is responsible for most of the movie's success .  his reaction shots , with his wildly exaggerated eye movements , are comedic gems .  the story's main subplot concerns four animal rights activists , justice ( shannon elizabeth ) and her three sexy buddies , sissy ( eliza dushku ) , missy ( jennifer schwalbach smith ) and chrissy ( ali larter ) .  these charlie's angels types give a ride to our heroes on their trek to lalaland to stop the picture .  jay tries to put the moves on justice , but he doesn't stay in command of the situation for long .  one of the funnier sight gags has the women using a pink , clam-shaped , birth control case that contains high tech gadgetry .  granted , it's not the movie for everyone , but , if you like kevin smith's brand of humor , you'll find that this is his best .  and , as i said earlier , it's the funniest movie of the year thus far .  no , wait .  forget , `thus far . '  it's bound to be the funniest movie of the year .  in a time when almost every movie feels obligated to come in at pg-13 so that they can rake in the maximum cash , it's great to see a filmmaker with the guts to target only a mature audience .  jay and silent bob strike back runs a lightening fast 1 : 35 .  it is rated r and contains pervasive crude humor and language and sexual situations .  it would be acceptable for high school seniors and older .  the film opens nationwide in the united states on wednesday , august 22 , 2001 .  in the silicon valley , it will be showing at the amc and the century theaters .

1|damn those trailers .  had it not been for the advertising of this film , which reveals far too much about its contents , i would have been glued to `under the sand' .  as it is , the film retains some value , thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling , and a more mature francois ozon in the director's chair .  marie ( charlotte rampling ) and her husband jean ( bruno cremer ) lounge on the beach .  she takes a nap while he goes for a swim .  when marie wakes up , jean is nowhere to be found .  she contacts authorities , but they can't find him either .  did he disappear to start a new life ?  was he killed by accident ?  did he commit suicide ?  marie still asks herself these questions a year later , and in order to move on with her life , she must find some answers .  it's a fine premise , and this little movie uses it to the limit .  the film moves at a leisurely pace , a bit slow , but relaxing .  it's a very visual story , and you can pretty much just sit back without reading the subtitles .  this is mostly thanks to the excellent camera work by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie , who shot the film in a dreamy haze , and the lead performance by rampling .  rampling is so expressive in her portrayal of marie , you connect with her character instantly , despite that she's delusional .  the scenes where she interacts with her husband , who she still believes is alive , are heartbreaking .  she can't quite get over him .  they've been married for twenty-five years .  the other actors , particularly jacques nolot , are excellent too .  the sex in the film is rather unneeded , but compared to ozon's `criminal lovers' , it's the disney channel .  likely to cause some discussion afterwards , `under the sand' is a fine movie going experience .  while it's hard to recommend as entertainment , it's a fine adult alternative about how we deal with loss .  ozon seems to ask what you would do , and that's certainly a hard question to answer .  |0.19933333333333333|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|The sentiment is generally positive as the reviewer praises Charlotte Rampling's performance, François Ozon's direction, the film's fine premise, and excellent camera work.

1|"bob the happy bastard's quickie review :  rush hour  so what's the problem with 48 hours clones these days ?  they always try for the same thing that eddie murphy and nick nolte had .  that was the problem that plagued these clones , not to mention the actual sequel : another 48 hours , a complete waste of film .  but , at last , someone has a different take on the matter , and it's director brett rainer .  rush hour features jackie chan in his first u . s . action movie , playing a chinese detective who's being flown to the us to investigate the kidnapping of the chinese consulate's daughter .  of course , the fbi is upset that he'll be interfering in their investigation , and stick him with an lapd office with a big mouth- of course , that's chris tucker .  what makes rush hour work so damn well is the chemistry between the energetic chan and the absolutely hilarious tucker .  tucker mouths off to chan at every given opportunity ( "" i'm michael jackson , you tito . "" ) , and chan delivers a few zingers of his own , as well as some terrific fight scenes .  the story's pretty much your average fare , but with a decent twist involving the main villain , a highly clouded figure named jun tao .  at least it's entertaining , and the concept is excellently realized .  a particular fight scene in a chinese office , where chan and tucker duke it out with the bad guys , is funny and energetic at the same time .  and the finale's a real treat as well . . . chan  delivers yet another fantastic stunt for the fans with a 10-story drop .  rush hour is just the sort of film you'll get a kick out of on any night of the week .  just make sure you don't look for anything culturally different and you'll be fine- drunken master ii this ain't .

1|"this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron's most heralded film , titanic .  postponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview .  so , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ?  my best guess . . . . it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull .  no doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made .  it boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date .  to see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at .  the effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage .  but titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that's where the problem lies .  there is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise .  i'll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you :  the film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic .  we see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor .  bill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure .  what he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage .  we meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family .  rose is to be wed to a man she does not love .  we meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game .  the two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins .  add in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy .  i must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with "" new money "" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship .  she is a pleasure to see on screen .  when the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters .  the film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on .  the effects are tremendous .  from the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other .  we saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen .  my friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard .  when people are in the water , at film's end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles .  titanic runs far too long .  the movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length .  and , while most of the first 2 . 5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends .  don't get me wrong about titanic . . . . it's  not a bad as i am making it out to be .  it really is an exceptionaly well-made film .  the costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period .  the ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction .  this film will certainly win on effects , costume , set design and sound .  cameron has certainly made his best film to date .  unfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate .  it just doesn't have a strong supporting story .  it's an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside .  it just doesn't have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . cameron was shooting for .  i predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews .  it is a film worth seeing .  i predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office .  with its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video .  this will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts .  titanic opens december 19th , and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century-fox .  i give titanic 3 stars ( .  that's not bad .  ron epstein  riginally posted in home theater forum ===  "|0.19999999999999998|0.8000000000000002|0.7333333333333334|The sentiment towards the movie Titanic is generally positive, with some criticism of the love story and lack of emotional impact.
