1|james l . brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy .  nicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen .  he's racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone .  so , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t . v  sitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 ) .  naturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end .  like good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy .  nicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish .  only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers .  hunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson .  there's also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them .  kinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he's more of a plot convience than a character .  although his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together .  in fact , the scene stealer is simon's dog , who is funnier than nicholson .  but then again , pets are always cute on screen .  providing solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn't as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun .  he overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying .  smith is also good , although she has a fairly small role .  even director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor .  but this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he's in , he's steals it .  he's character is so hateful , though , it's amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol .  and this is the films main problem .  it's totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin .  she doesn't fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him .  also , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly .  i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person .  it would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out .  brooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience .  he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he's good .  there's also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer .  but , generally , as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do , which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie .  the movie is a bit overlong , but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly .  overall , as good as it gets is a fun movie , even though it may be unbelivable , and certainly worth seeing ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . )  not quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke ) , but still good fun .  |0.39999999999999997|0.8000000000000002|0.8000000000000002|The reviews generally express a slightly positive sentiment towards the film, praising the entertaining and funny elements, particularly Jack Nicholson's performance.

1|after a stylistic detour with mrs .  parker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption .  while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie .  it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it .  until mrs .  parker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies .  i found equinox , his last pre- mrs .  parker effort , to be irritating and frustrating .  i was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow .  there are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach .  the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch .  in short , rudolph has created a world that it's worth spending two hours in .  afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples .  jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) .  for her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level .  all she's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she's ovulating .  after he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor .  the other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they're no more content than jeffrey and marianne .  a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart .  they remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won't allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs .  the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable .  the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey .  the two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn't take long before they're lounging together , naked , in her pool .  meanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains .  the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love .  sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it's an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it's a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it's an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it's a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness .  ultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves .  the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances .  jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman .  those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity .  lara flynn boyle , who wasn't impressive in rudolph's equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability .  nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph's most pregnant lines with practiced ease .  the clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis .  her often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film's humor , and there's hardly ever a moment when she doesn't steal the spotlight from her co-stars .  i don't know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director's earlier productions .  enough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters .  afterglow is basically a four-pronged character study .  the plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that's the real reason to see this motion picture .  rudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction .  |0.3333333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.9|"The movie ""Afterglow"" is described as an intriguing and absorbing film with top-notch acting.

1|" "" the fugitive "" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made .  it takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that's totally believable throughout .  this isn't an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly .  harrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife .  the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner .  we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble's perspective .  hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble's wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered .  we don't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story .  in fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble's innocence ourselves .  the film doesn't spend much time on the details of kimble's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story .  one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck .  but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch .  this movie is so incredible because it's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable .  tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives .  from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur .  kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other .  most of the film deals with richard's complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife .  ford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy's script and davis's outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is .  just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting .  we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we .  meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down .  at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them .  he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery .  one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor .  there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) .  they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner .  the final act concludes with another terrific chase .  richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved .  the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don't realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together .  maybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it .  we're so relieved when justice is served .  it's not the plot is that makes "" the fugitive "" great , it's all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story .  watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous .  if only hollywood could produce more movies like this .

1|i think that any competent member of the human race who's ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer .  even though i try very hard to not predict films as i'm watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen .  but i don't care .  not even a little .  my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great .  2 ) drew barrymore is great .  3 ) the movie is so funny .  there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard .  i haven't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers .  sandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music .  in the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness .  a week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) .  with his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress .  she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months .  julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans .  soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other .  oh sure , it's trite .  and if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience .  what makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances .  barrymore is simply adorable here ( i've never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) .  not only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn't hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written .  and the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i've ever seen .  naturally , the true star here is sandler .  i think the guy is flat-out hilarious .  he can say something that just isn't funny , and his delivery makes me laugh .  his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy .  whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into .  as far as i'm concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents .  and the movie is just so funny .  perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him .  this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air .  and while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half .  my formal complaints for the wedding singer aren't very important .  the film is predicable , but who cares ?  the characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable .  in addition to this , i can't imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film .  in that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review .  i just want everyone to know that i laughed .  a lot .  |0.2995833333333333|0.8333333333333334|0.9|The sentiment of the explanations is slightly positive overall due to the user's enjoyment of the performances and humor in the movie, despite mentioning predictability.
1|"based on the boris karloff's classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive .  recap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy .  problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . .  walking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good .  the visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all .  they pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi .  the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) .  unfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres .  on one hand , it is a fast paced action film .  on the other , it's a frightening horror film .  and on the side , it's a hilarious comedy .  ideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) .  the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner .  if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep's entombment , that would be impossible .  and then there's the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies .  while really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy .  replace the sword with a chainsaw and you'd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness .  while entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place .  but at least it's a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of .  on the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience .  but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn  the sound down !  while a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you're not careful ) .  when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , "" end of days "" , it was so loud i couldn't make anything out .

1|"on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with .  in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his "" giallo "" murder mysteries .  while it's certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller .  the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book "" tenebrae "" .  with the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems .  the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa .  he brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him .  the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension .  argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business .  tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here .  it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play .  in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes .  needless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director's brilliance as a stylist .  many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork .  they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria .  instead , tenebrae's set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world .  and the soundtrack's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment .  so tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question .  still , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative .  some critics argue that logic doesn't matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don't deserve to feel cheated .  by the way , if you don't want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs .  about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious .  we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal .  he is insane , apparently .  the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it's time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife .  he is finally revealed to us as this "" second killer "" in the film's bloody climax .  but argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively .  you see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer's house .  but thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway .  bad cutting puts the timing way out .  in other words , he's almost in two places at once .  during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring .  by the film's end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant .  the injury ?  he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock !  thus , the revelation of the "" hero "" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled .  helpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along .  but there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least .  the story owes us a better understanding of franciosa's mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage .  tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies .  for instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike .  we would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren't even introduced too !  that's careless filmmaking , pure and simple .  why , you may ask , do i go on about the story's flaws ?  because when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world .  take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae .  an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town .  finally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer's lair .  it's an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone .  and that's exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating .  too often , it seems , argento's films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts .  mind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look .  and if you're a fan of argento's unique style of giallo thriller then it's essential .  see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli .  it's a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative .  a shame , because it doesn't have to be that way .  take argento's more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache .  proof that he can do it , if he tries . . .

1|as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult .  parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives .  but if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome .  `affliction' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood .  the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) .  here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface .  he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me .  but as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head .  we see that he is a mean-tempered person .  he has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him .  he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence .  he also has tremendous problems with relationships .  he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter .  but his bearish persona and stature alienates her .  he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him .  his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk .  she tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point .  finally , he is spiteful and vindictive .  as a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless .  as the town's only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died .  we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain .  he is a prisoner and a slave to it .  he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension .  what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ?  we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) .  this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet .  he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist .  we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks .  to heighten the father's churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person .  very effective .  today , wade's dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man .  the influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade .  the result is every son's nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be .  this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity .  he's a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father .  coburn displays heft as the bitter dad .  but , it's most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare .  there's nothing light or fluffy about this film .  that may turn many moviegoers away .  but it's certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte's and coburn's raw acting talents .  |-0.36600000000000005|0.7666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|The text explores the negative impact of a dysfunctional childhood, including themes of violence and emotional instability, and highlights the influence of an abusive father on the protagonist.

1|is evil dead ii a bad movie ?  it's full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release .  explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult .  `well what's it about ? '  `five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly , hairy , wart covered monsters . '  `come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week .  why should i see it again ? '  `no evil dead ii is different , it's funny . '  `it's funny to see people die ?  are you sick or something ? '  maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie .  his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious .  an example of raimi's odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash's girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound .  sure it's over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet .  the whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster .  the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes .  no matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes .  and raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand .  like the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part .  but it doesn't end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family .  all of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny .  raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off .  with a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares .  ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn't wait to make it's sequel .  |-0.6333333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|The text expresses a negative sentiment towards the movie, citing negative elements such as terrible acting, pointless violence, and plot holes.

1|it's rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year , but that is what disney and pixar animation ; s latest film represents .  while a bugs life isn't nearly as deep as it's predecessor , dreamwork's antz , it is just as funny .  a bug's life centers , appropriately , around the life of an ant , named flik .  flik , cutely voiced by newsradio's david foley , hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task .  when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost , the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way .  the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them .  the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper , who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey .  when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food .  when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission , they never dream he will be successful , they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food .  flik's mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return .  instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs , who he mistakenly assumes are warriors .  when he returns with the `warriors' , the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes .  a bug's life has animation that is simply stunning .  the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative .  together with the great voice acting , this film is the perfect holiday family film .  its main weakness is that it couldn't beat antz to the theaters , making it seem like stale material .  |0.21666666666666667|0.7833333333333333|0.6999999999999998|"The overall sentiment of the text is slightly positive, with praise for the stunning animation, voice acting, and humor.

1|"not since oliver stone's natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility .  while fincher's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997's the game ) into something like a definitive statement .  jack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia .  on the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer .  here he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia .  strangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob's breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy "" tourist "" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity .  later , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life .  one night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don't ask-- you'll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn't feel good .  it is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison .  he moves into tyler's squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are "" don't talk about fight club . ""  armed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees .  resentment creeps into jack's heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla .  funded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem .  their initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour .  it is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist .  it is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting .  it's a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out .  fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people .  in the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it .  i'll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don't spring up here and there , and i'll be even more amazed if fincher isn't vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone .  they needn't bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher's elaborate attempt at a joke .  tyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization .  in this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won't .  hopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won't spoil the joke for the rest of us .

 no . . . okay ,  well i just did !  i coulda done without her whole "" romance "" angle , but to be honest , it doesn't take up much of the film , which is generally covered in blood , explosions , guts and elvis nods .  try to see how many "" inside "" connections to the king you can guess .  of course , it's no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind .  i also like these types of "" guy "" movies a lot , and even though the film doesn't bring much originality to the table , it does offer a pretty coherent story , some nice twists and turns , humor and a big ol' helping of whoop-ass coming straight from costner and russell's respective boots .  probably not a film for everyone , but definitely for those who enjoy the guns , the charismatic bad guys and a fun , if entirely disposable , adventure .  now see how many elvis songs i've used to pun my way through this phony review below .  the elvis songs also recommend this movie !  so whether you're lonesome tonight or any other night , remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets , leave your little sister at home , bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse , cause this movie ain't one to return to the sender .  i really beg of you , whether you're stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel , to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender .  and no suspicious minds either , folks , cause i got stung by this movie , i mean it really shook me up , and unless you're the devil in disguise himself , i think you won't be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either .  so don't be cruel , don't turn away , don't curl up with your latest flame tonite ( whether she be a hard-headed woman or not ) and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film .  it's now or never , folks .  trust me , i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i'd seen so far this year is far behind me .  joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building .  thank you . . . thank  you very much ! !  where's joblo coming from ?

1|>from the commercials , this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight .  instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end .  the concept is deceptively pedestrian .  an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way .  the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea .  the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents .  following one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin .  it's difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot .  seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one .  without giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion .  and it's all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner .  a grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs .  drawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations .  |0.5033333333333333|0.7833333333333333|0.85|The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive, as they highlight that the movie is hilarious and exceeds expectations with a talented cast and funny moments.
1|"i'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review .  i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson's political satire "" wag the dog , "" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it .  quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn't do that .  they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn't quite do that either .  a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick's "" dr .  strangelove "" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn't do that .  that said , "" wag the dog "" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them .  the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office .  the accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn't particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood .  brean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor .  as i said , "" wag the dog "" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform "" we have the right to fight for democracy . ""  another scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village .  the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team's attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt .  william "" old shoe "" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho .  of course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what's going on and strikes a deal with the president's electoral opponent to report to the media that the "" fighting "" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis .  still , even with the cia's involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable .  regardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn't the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ?  the film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt .  schumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it .  there was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss's forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away .  with these plot holes , "" wag the dog "" doesn't quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place .  brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off .  the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret .  motss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project .  in fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss's increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created .  i think it's fair to say that "" wag the dog "" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire .  still , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one .  wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn't even real ?  with this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws .

1|"the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible .  people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred .  five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg's survivors of the shoah visual history foundation .  the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry .  as the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe .  in 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany's reach , and they became the last target of hitler's "" final solution . ""  each of the five tells his or her story .  their stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary .  they recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to "" work "" camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps .  they recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope .  each recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation .  and finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps .  needless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining .  by themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five .  the last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it's mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage .  in this kind of movie it's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects' narration .  the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days .  it's not clear which scene it is .  it could be one of two that i hadn't seen before , both powerful .  one is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars .  there is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white .  another segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore .  there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say .  but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , in greater detail .  and i'm glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject .  the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful .  x-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green .  also , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) ,  so the richness and detail are impeccable .  the dvd's features are plentiful and well-chosen .  there is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter .  there are about fifty still photos , both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors .  also , the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen ) , both on the same side .  one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew ) .  you'd think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary , but they're not bloopers .  instead , they are solid , moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length .  one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film .  renee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr . hans m ? nch , a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz .  firestone was aggressive , questioning the doctor about what his children thought .  the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable .  another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz .  he ends his prayer by saying "" . . . forgive me for surviving .

""  what sort of pies ?  chicken pies , of course .  co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave . ""  the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures .  part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new .   "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories .  but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived .  now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run . ""  the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement .  thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done .  part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ?  park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is .  but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us .  another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing .  there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17 .

""  there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history .  the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it .  when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution .  consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online .  out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome .  why ?  because once you got past the thought that "" they're parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose .  they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing .  conversely , "" chicken run "" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene .  if you've never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun .  even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character .  park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either .  enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer .  the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them .  ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it .  she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer .  the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet .  poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help .  jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence .  they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma .  one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of "" chicken run , "" it comes as a delightful surprise .  the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens .  the animation is first-rate .  remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable "" chicken run "" really is .  this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail .  as in such top-notch family fare as "" a bug's life "" or "" toy story 2 , "" "" chicken run "" has something to offer in nearly every frame .  certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details .  anyway , the movie's just a boatload of fun .  funnest damn movie i've seen all year .

1|"capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg .  joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs .  it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure .  the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious .  i had a good time .   , low +2 ( -4 to +4 )  here goes my credibility .  this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority .  i liked the third jurassic park film .  i even liked the second jurassic park film .  in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton's novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle's novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle .  jp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , "" for the boy who's half man or the man who's half boy . ""  that is what all the jurassic park films are .  expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house .  the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon's mines had under-written characters also .  jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs .  the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting .  some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds .  that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require .  i feel i got my money's worth .  the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica .  this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park .  they hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island's dinosaurs from a safe height .  the height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not .  the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended .  flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide .  he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs .  but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go .  doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs .  they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn .  he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once .  right .  guess what happens next ?  jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 .  first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm .  sattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first .  curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance .  one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time .  they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films .  of course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species .  not only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic .  in this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition .  this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized .  each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course .  in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty .  it has a crocodile's head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright .  perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs .  sometimes they just move too fast to see .  occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision .  a few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory .  but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films .  the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams's score for the first film .  joe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky .  a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay .  the film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun .  if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you .  i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .

1|just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) .  either way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny .  why is this ?  maybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional .  director stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day .  when watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again .  i laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends .  i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time .  and i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around .  rob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all .  he uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman .  and like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort .  he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it .  whatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co .  grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives .  rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in .  during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him .  but these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) .  the plot in three words is : women and music .  the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective .  it gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle .  it also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is .  jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball .  just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week .  what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes .  john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob .  now instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say .  the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended .  instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that .  also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie .  high fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs .  i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great .  |0.4000000000000001|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|"The text expresses a generally positive sentiment towards the movie ""High Fidelity"", highlighting its comedic aspects, relatable characters, and effective directing.

1|"plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes .  he is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors .  oh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ?  kewl !  critique : despite this film not looking like a "" tim burton movie "" or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare .  although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations .  i mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real !  i also have to "" give it up "" to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well .  i especially enjoyed bonham carter's performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth's bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part .  plot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest .  i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of "" human beings as animals "" then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film .  i also hated the "" kid "" character who just got on my nerves and didn't really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won't ruin it here but c'mon guys . . . you  coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? ) .  but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests .  this dude didn't seem to give a rat's ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn't really care about what happened to him either .  now i'm not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it .  visually , the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) , but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton .  the "" surprise ending "" that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 , felt a little tacked on here , and despite being interesting , didn't really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) .  so overall , i loved the whole "" feel "" of the planet , the apes that ruled it , the manner in which they treated the humans , screamed , shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain , but didn't appreciate the film's lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring .  but i would still recommend this film as a fun , summer movie with laughs , creepiness and a really cool premise .  ps : for anyone who has seen the original , i cannot believe that they didn't at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which he's suddenly been thrust ( "" this is a mad house ! "" -  type of thing ) .  the guy in this film barely seems to be "" put off "" by the fact that he's surrounded by apes who can speak english ! !  where's joblo coming from ?  the arrival ( 8/10 ) - battlefield earth ( 7/10 ) - godzilla ( 4/10 ) - instinct ( 6/10 ) - mission to mars ( 3/10 ) - pitch black ( 7/10 ) - ( 1968 ) planet of the apes ( 9/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 )  "|0.03333333333333335|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|"The reviewer's sentiment towards the movie ""Planet of the Apes"" is slightly positive.

1|"disaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched .  to see a disaster film with actual originality , or at least a decent plot twist , would definitely be a welcome surprise .  unfortunately , folks , it's not likely .  dante's peak is cliched , and at times corny , but also pretty decent .  to be honest , i wasn't very interested in seeing this film , and word of mouth , as well as several reviews , didn't make it sound promising .  so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasn't bad at all .  it's pretty run of the mill , but it's not something i would say is merely "" ok "" to watch .  in case you don't know , dante's peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in it's shadow , dante's peak ( who would've guessed , eh ? ) .  pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and , perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof , is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future .  due to the lack of more substantial evidence , nobody warns the small town , and when they finally do , it's in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows .  brosnan , all around good guy , will , of course , save the day .   .   .  or at least the mayor of dante's peak ( linda hamilton ) .  naturally the two will become infatuated with one another .

1|"in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers .  full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture .  go see it !  so , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on "" hard copy "" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980's .   "" hard copy "" 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for .  smart replied that she thought kidman's character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal .   ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . )  smart's got a point .  it wouldn't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version .  however , given a choice between the mass media 'happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later .  real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman .  to die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb .  the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being 'on tv . '  of course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon .  but , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily .  kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne .  i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture .  her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates .  kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell .  she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way .  at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law .   "" you know , "" she knowingly exclaims , "" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . ""  her husband beams at suzanne's profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters .  this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks .  the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix .  he plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne's sexual favors .  kidman's character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland .  phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) .  his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain't going anywhere , ever .  phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him .  gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate .  he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along .  van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn't stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions .  van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to 'get it' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story .  the screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i've heard since heathers .  henry's story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters .  henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic .  danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands .  either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties .  all-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks !  to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant .  written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman , matt dillon , joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard .  rated r - for language and mature themes .

1|"i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool .  i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement .  this was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm .  then marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups .  it certainly didn't look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his "" last night of freedom . ""  ben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this 'till death do you part business .  then , on an ill-fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah , ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock ) , a free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her .  as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he's never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she's never had .  forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue .  ben is an ideal role for affleck's easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation .  sandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping .  the two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script's apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely .  lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification .  the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution .  forces of nature isn't about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it's about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it's not what he thought it was .  lawrence's script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense .  earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine .  though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you'll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom .  that is , provided you're not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes .  for a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans .  occasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can't find what's underneath .  a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes' excesses can't spoil this unique concoction .  forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents .

"" fail-safe "" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism .  the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws .  five u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america .  the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers .  suddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike .  a great deal of "" fail-safe "" 's plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia's borders--at any cost .  the plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios .  the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails .  general bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable .  the events in "" fail-safe "" are fascinating because they're anything but predictable , but the real reason "" fail-safe "" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot .  a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states' role in all of it .  most of this is through the film's use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president's advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war .  many of the film's most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices .  early in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of "" strategy "" in a nuclear assault to "" minimize "" casualties .   "" what's the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? ""  a guest asks impatiently .   "" forty million , "" groeteschele responds wryly .  the problem with groeteschele's mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war .  the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals .  groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over .  yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o'herlihy ) has often recommended .  on the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage .  such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race .   "" fail-safe "" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film .  why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ?  is it wise ?  is it even logical ?  no , not really .  although "" fail-safe "" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way .  again , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film's most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance .  in addition to providing the central "" pro-nuclear war "" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism .  the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib .  one of groeteschele's "" logical "" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it's merely absurd .  he labels the average marxist an "" unfeeling , calculating machine "" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself .  groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia's home soil--which must be preserved at all costs .  groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would .  the irony here is groeteschele's own mechanical theorizing .  he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn't even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns .  once the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be .  just how will the soviet union's leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ?   ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? )  with the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet's long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader .  without getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances .   ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear "" incident "" can probably be . )  it does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn't possible because of its all-too-real consequences .  dramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o'herlihy's character as the symbolic "" matador "" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film's opening ) , is particularly appropriate .   "" fail-safe "" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film .  nevertheless , under lumet's direction and walter bernstein's intelligent adaptation of burdick's and wheeler's novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded .  the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming .  but it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that "" fail-safe "" also finds dangerous .  in retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century .  it's just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele's dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown .

1|"andrew lloyd webber's musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time .  webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as "" oklahoma ! , "" or the slapstickness of shows like "" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . ""  they instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics .  like "" jesus christ superstar , "" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune "" superstar , "" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn't spread his message wider ) , "" evita "" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) .   "" evita "" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn't like di slept to "" the top "" ) .  webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it .  here , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad .  it's also a musical , with almost no words not unsung .  the film plays like a rock opera , much like their "" jesus christ superstar , "" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one .  after all , this is a musical , and webber's musicals never undermine this .  they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side .  this is why the beginning of "" evita "" is kind of a let-down .  okay , it is a let-down .  i'm not saying the opening moments are bad , because they're pretty good .  but what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand .  in the musical , it's a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , "" buenos aires , "" which is also lifeless .  then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , "" another suitcase in another hall , "" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva .  the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it's being narrated by a hater of eva's , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light .  for a while , it looks like alan parker can't pull it off .  however , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song "" goodbye and thank you , "" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful .  from this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical .  no more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact .  we see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) .  more importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work .  juan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory .  a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before .  >from the "" goodbye and thank you "" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation's people downtrodden .  but despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star .  that's when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn't the great woman she really was , and expose her fame .  describing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he's said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can't help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death .  alan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he's done "" fame , "" "" the committments , "" "" bugsy malone , "" and "" pink floyd the wall "" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is .  we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented .  his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is .  and there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings "" don't cry for me , argentina , "" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is .  madonna's golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film .  at the beginning , she looks like she's too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) .  her death , though , is brilliant .  her singing could be better though .  i know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she's trying to hard .  she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti  lupone - i heard her sing on an old "" evita "" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) .  but it's generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires .  antonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i'm one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator .  his singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin .  he does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range .  and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade .  although it gets off to a rocky start ( "" rocky "" 's polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical .  like the other musical released in '96 ( woody allen's "" everyone says i love you "" ) , it's a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance .

1|"there's more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell .  in how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality .  all the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future .  motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative .  the "" quilting bee "" consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma's husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna's daughter .  the project they're busy with is the wedding quilt for hy's granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged .  she's spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it's better to marry a friend or a lover .  one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast .  from winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent .  the performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script's weaknesses .  how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added .  there are probably too many characters .  so , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives .  we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible .  there are other episodes as well : the love of anna's life , marianna's soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend's husband .  the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn's story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger .  there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt .  the stories are all well-told , but it's difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly .  while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous .  there isn't enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing .  to put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn't "" do much "" for me .  on the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships .  finn's segment is by far the most compelling , because she's the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else's experiences .  the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees .  if there's a disappointment here , it's that the script doesn't have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional .
