0|"warning : spoilers are included in this review . . .  but it doesn't really make much of a difference .  deep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 .  remember when dante's peak came out in february ?  a few months later , volcano was released .  the first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen .  the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent .  well , it's deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition .  this time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july .  of course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante's peak .  but while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film .  apparently many did , and it utterly baffles me .  to be completely honest , i haven't had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life .  volcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch .  deep impact doesn't just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot .  the only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters .  deep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) .  a line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above .  among these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) .  leo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds .  he races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident .  a year passes , and nothing is heard about it again .  we are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc .  she gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) .  she talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie .  after talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help .  luckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain "" ellie "" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . .  that girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) .  before she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road .  they take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) .  beck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference .  naturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question .  and so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive .  they announce a plan called "" ark , "" which is their only hope for survival .  a computer will select 800 , 000 people at random .  these people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won't kill off the entire human race .  after two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over .  the rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning .  jenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom .  the final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional .  it's a shame that nothing else is heartfelt .  now , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface .  the title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it !  by doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won't work .  director mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show "" er . ""  her major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film .  well , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one .  suggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre .  much of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off .  throughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) .  it literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it's that boring .  of course , leder isn't all to blame for it .  screenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time .  what starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) .  chock full of cheesy one liners ( "" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! "" )  and stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again .  only one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring .  and the main plot is so outrageous that you can't figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi .  to put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation .  that's right , 80% miss , and 20% hit .  scenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic .  but the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening .  the concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that's forgiveable .  what isn't forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface .  give me a break , will ya ?  and of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth .  well , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant .  the water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous .  cgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks .  in fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days .  just when we think visual effects can't be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be .  one thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder's direction , which also influences the actors .  leder loves to show the actors' faces before and during moments of terror .  this reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) .  but harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations .  leder likes to flaunt people's fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist .  one moment has an astronaut flying off into space .  this should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person's face while drifting into space .  this is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled .  on another note , leder's film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts .  the pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown .  then again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it's obvious it will be emotional .  it's mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into "" feeling "" for the characters , but it didn't work for me .  but anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given .  t ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv's "" the naked truth "" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role .  her character is made stronger by leoni's presence , and we grow to care for her .  robert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot .  elijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn't had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama !  you are too talented for this stuff ) .  vanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen .  maximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor .  morgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) .  leelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character .  a special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby .  eldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot .  crosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv's "" star trek : the next generation . ""  seeing her was one of the highlights of the film .  overall , a very talented cast virtually wasted .  deep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language .  this is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever .  luckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful .  it's a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn't worth much .  costing nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience .  well , it's not .  when the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it .

0|"my first press screening of 1998 and already i've gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list .  what an auspicious beginning !  welcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere .  firestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves's academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year's crop of movies .  as our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are "" smokejumpers . ""  we then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from "" cosmopolitan . ""  having the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest .  when , even in the beginning , the director can't get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble .  with the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles .  not bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people .  miraculously , they manage to hear her and move away .  in a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building .  as it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl's face .  our show's two heroes , the crew's chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl .  in a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames .  the manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse .  this mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make .  the chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group .  will it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica's two firefighting buddies ?  she has only seconds to decide who will be saved .  yes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway .  not content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth's screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape .   ( "" hoods in the woods , "" is what the "" ground-pounders "" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . )  along the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor .  most of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing .  he flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck .  arguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside .  using a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building's attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust .  when the film isn't using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey .  editor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions .  the ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie .  perhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , "" it's not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . ""  firestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 .  it is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers .

0|"ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking .  these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous .  if it's not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect .  hackers is guilty of all of these crimes .  to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can't take it anymore .  those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled "" goofs "" .  this is the section for mistakes in the movies .  well , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : "" generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology "" .  and truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct .  the plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking .  more specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller .  miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers .  the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems .  he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old .  the film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer .  dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi .  oh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film .  really , i can't think of much more to say about the film's plot aside from what i've said .  it's just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi .  thanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do .  this movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time , and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list .  to sum it up , hackers is a terrible computer film .  if you're looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers .  although at times it too may seem a little far fetched , it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users .  hopefully , this film didn't influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time .

0|"if there's one thing i just can't stand , it's a film that oozes with sentimentality .  here's a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves .  swelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless .  alas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up .  what reminded me was that i wasn't choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter .  my giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word "" cute "" but i've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a "" cute "" film here ) .  it takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience .  maybe it will work for some people .  it didn't work for me .  billy crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania .  he's in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film .  the screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall .  his name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he'd be a great movie star because of his size .  subplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he's never around for them , so they move to chicago .  max is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins .  sam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved .  sam is broke .  max is dying .  pass the kleenex .  my giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny .  it has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself .  in one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn't believe that he's actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) .  crystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he's countered by a slew of jokes that aren't funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes .  muresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can't act very well .  quinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents .  she was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff .  here , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent .  all of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre .  as my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings .  sam's multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) .  later , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam's reunion with his family .  and some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) .  it's icky .  it drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions .  my giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film .  more importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is .  instead , it's a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears .  and since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world .

0|this is not a simple plan about finding a plane load of money and getting away with the cash .  this is more about a parable of greed , and how money can become the bane of your life .  yes , there are elements of ? fargo' here ( the snow and cold ) , although not as vivid in the blood and gore department .  it shows how greed can set of a chain of events leading to death and the destruction of lives .  and how at the end of the day , the things that matter most are love , truth and honesty .  although in one sense it may seem tedious , making a movie about the ugliness of greed ( not box office material ) , it does become tedious , not because of the morale ending , but because one expects the movie to end that way .  this becomes apparent after the first murder to cover up the crime , the rest of the movie just spirals downward from there .  the characters in this drama are a mixture of simple and intellectual folk , brothers and friends , who all fall prey to the avarice of money .  they should have perhaps thrown in someone sensible , level headed and not affected by greed to give the party more balance .  commendable is the exceptional performance of billy bob thornton , whose portrayal of the simpleton brother was masterful .  bill paxton also gives a powerful performance as the greedier younger brother , whilst bridget fonda is convincing as the greediest wife , who indirectly causes the most problems .  fill a room full of greedy people and several million dollars , and you will end up with a simple recipe for a blood bath .  it's not a simple plan , when you shoot everyone you love for money , unless you're the menendez brothers .  |-0.39999999999999997|0.8333333333333334|0.9|The text has a slightly negative sentiment due to its focus on the negative consequences of greed, including murder, death, and destruction, but there is also some appreciation for the performances of the actors.
0|"based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won't bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) .  can you say . . . the  third times not a charm ?  plot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation's top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week .  critique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture .  when you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that's not a very good sign .  i also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes .  when you consider that the other "" part "" of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign .  and when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this "" big "" summer blockbuster .  it blows .  or as they say in french , "" eet blows "" .  could it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ?  maybe .  could it be that most of the special effects don't show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don't see anything that its trailers hadn't already given away ?  perhaps .  or could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ?  naaaaaaah !  a bad movie is a bad movie .  on a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in .  branagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that's pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped .  smith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others .  i would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie .  then again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh  yeah , but the rest of the movie sucked .  little known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all-time top grossing films worldwide : 1997's summer blockbuster men in black ( 7/10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy-winning title song , and 1996's independence day ( 6/10 ) .  he once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career .  kevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama , and has been married to the cute-as-a-button actress phoebe cates since 1989 .  they have two kids together , greta simone and owen .  one of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has "" kasdan "" written on it .  lawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss .  salma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english .  she made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders' mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez's desperado opposite antonio banderas .  since then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez's films .  she stands 5'2 "" , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother .  one of the actresses cast as branagh's lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling , a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner ( 7/10 ) .  another is dutch-born frederique van der wal , who is one of the world's most recognized supermodels , having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times , as well as harper's bazaar , vogue and mademoiselle .

 how do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ?  these kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me .  argo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron .  one day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman's cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art .  kara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of "" whatever "" that protects the city .  in the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death . . .  in three days time , or something .  kara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world .  the power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) .  selena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination .  selena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she's arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) .  supergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives .  ok . . .  huh ?  why does the omegahedron fall from the sky but supergirl shoots out of the bottom of a lake ?  attention movie : explain yourself !  i'm sorry , i can only suspend disbelief so much .  i can't buy into any of this nonsense just because the movie wants me to .  knowing that she needs a secret identity , supergirl basically "" wills "" herself into a school girl outfit ( complete with a different hairstyle ) , picks the alias linda lee and enrolls into school .  she's given her dorm assignment , and who happens to be her roommate ?  lois lane's sister , lucy .  ok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we're getting really contrived now .  what follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . .  complete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) .  best moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks .  at this point i'm rapidly wondering why i'm bothering with this nonsense .  there is some credit to give to the film however .  one lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an "" evil "" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its "" prey "" is very well done .  also , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools .  hart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara's love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film's more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some "" menacing "" bumper cars ) .  then there were numerous little things that bothered me .  the flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . .  it's all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires .  instead of having her look like she's flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be "" graceful "" , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers .  also , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ?  a pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a "" wacky "" demise .  there is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye's , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) .  finally , just one word : monsters .  faye dunaway and peter o'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o'toole overacts he's entertaining and when dunaway does it she's annoying ( her character actually says the line "" seize them ! ""  at one point ) .  dunaway's henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty's otis character from the first two superman movies .  helen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she's written to be , as she's able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable .  believability aside though , it's still annoying .  now despite all this negativity ( and i'm not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd !  they have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . .  yet i'm still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) .  the first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters .  the movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory .  extras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and "" special project consultant "" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries .  the transfer on this international version is incredible . . .  you'd think you were watching a new release .  images are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts .  only some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn't much that can be done about that ( unless you're obsessive like george lucas ) .  the new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you'll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films' golan-globus production ) .  the commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries .  bosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there's no dead air on the track .  bosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation .  although , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn't get that response .  we learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the "" almost "" appearance in the film by christopher reeve .  great detail is given about superman's proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out .  as it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission .  for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one .  szwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy "" whimsical fantasy "" nonsense .  bosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office .  again , for the sake of brevity , i won't even get into that one .  anchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set .  disc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release .  disc two features the never before seen director's cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long .  the additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don't add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o'toole's screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) .  the print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won't care .  one question though . . .  shouldn't the director's commentary be on the director's cut of the film ?  i'd never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd .  i was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it .  so when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect .  i knew the film wasn't beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc .  as the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong .  come to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . .  so i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started .  at the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city .  ugh , i give up .  i'm surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs .  supergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie .

0|" "" practical magic , "" is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one .  the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens , two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches , spanning back 200 years .  at the start , their parents die when they are still children , and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest ) .  switch to the present day , gillian , who is the stronger , more rebellious sibling , leaves home , and meets up with a dark , abusive guy ( goran visjnic ) , while sally stays in their hometown , meets and falls in love with a sweet , caring man , has two children , and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it , she's not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes ) .  when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic , they accidentally murder him , and in desperation , bury the body in the backyard of their aunts' house .  add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism , not to mention a spattering of "" light-hearted whimsy , "" and you have a pretty good idea how messy "" practical magic "" is .  after seeing the film , i reflected that there was not even one scene , or element , that i liked or enjoyed .  it is a comedy , to be sure , but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat , and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching .  it is not charming or entertaining in any way .  and then to top it off , we've got this dark , but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian's body .  whatever .  the characters are handled terribly , and actually , most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character .  there is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film , and in every scene involving them , they are always standing side-by-side .  no attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people .  the same goes for aidan quinn , as a handsome police investigator , who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock , even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark , and once again , there is no attempt to develop their relationship , or his character , in any way .  in fact , every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along , rather than getting to know the people saying the lines .  i should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits , when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman , who managed to destroy the "" batman "" series with "" batman forever "" and "" batman and robin . ""   "" practical magic "" is directed by griffin dunne , primarily an actor , who last year made the contrived , clumsy romance , "" addicted to love , "" with meg ryan and matthew broderick .  i disliked that movie quite a bit , but since "" practical magic "" is even worse , that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is .  i'd tell him to quit while he's ahead , but in these last two years , he's ultimately already buried himself .

""  -- yet none of them have been horror films .   "" sleepy hollow "" is his first attempt to actually scare people .  i greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton's whole career seemed to be leading up to this .  i left disappointed .  andrew kevin walker's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story "" the legend of sleepy hollow . ""  in the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors .  ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders .  several of the town's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman .  although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning .  he also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret .  along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) .  my reaction : ho-hum .  the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting .  that in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages .  however , burton's attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy .  it might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal .  along the same lines , it doesn't help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue-in-cheek tales from the crypt tv series .  a witch's eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit's , a tree spurts blood like it's in a monty python sketch , and the headless horseman .   .   .  well , he's a guy without a head .   .   .  on a horse ( boo ! ) .  the performances are also awful .  although he's impressed me with his work in other films , depp doesn't seem to know what to do with ichabod , and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that's supposed to pass for an 18th century accent .  ricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic , which guarantees that we won't sympathize with her character .  the actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish .  the only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee , martin landau , and christopher walken .  i wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola's projected series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only "" bram stoker's dracula "" and "" mary shelley's frankenstein . ""  coppola is an executive producer for "" sleepy hollow , "" and the script reflects his interest in early forms of "" moving pictures , "" particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion .   ( there's a bird on one side of the card , a cage on the other .  when the card is flipped rapidly , the bird appears to be caged . )  bottom line : the hollow isn't the only thing that's sleepy .

0|"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species .  squandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley's a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain't ) .  miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they'd dare tempt fate and go for another round .  so here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid .  the film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can .  in other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there's a catch -- he's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who's now infected with alien dna .  patrick's overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring .  and when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick's primary focus turns to her -- "" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable "" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction .  species ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around .  however , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered .  mr . brancato's original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches .  like the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there's a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious .  last time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker's psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- "" something bad happened here . ""  this time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter "" this is awful . ""  and she's not even empathic !  and when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who's telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , "" he's going to rape her . ""  while species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own .  there's an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn't really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( "" he's in aisle 1 ! ""  informs eve ) .  if the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion .  much of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it's terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief .  the implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve's brain ?  why are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ?  my favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks .  this is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it's being foisted upon the public .  returning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there's realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis .  mykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick's neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film .  mr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) .  ms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that "" she's so empowered . ""  a lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that's * what i call empowerment .

0|the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks .  tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive .  this time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail .  what follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane .  when comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior .  but even on it's own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie .  while the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time .  while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately .  to be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not .  snipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later .  tommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge .  the sense of deja vu was overwhelming .  i know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film .  there's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing .  nobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie .  downey jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife .  nobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot .  the supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it's face .  it doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either .  the film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory .  as said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional .  if this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average .  and because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie .  stuart baird , the director , is all right , but there's no particular scene that stands out .  it's director is the usual action movie style .  even the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension .  the special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there's a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith .  but in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement .  sure , it's loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain't fun .  bored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie .  overall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities  |-0.7000000000000001|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|The sentiment score is negative because the review describes the movie as lousy, mentions a lack of character development and unimpressive performances, and criticizes the uninteresting plot and lack of excitement, ultimately finding the film lacking in enjoyment.
0|"one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton's 1925 silent film seven chances .  now i've never seen seven chances , as i'm more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this .  o'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company .  he also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he's unwilling to marry her .  his reasons ?  well he's a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don't like to be roped or something ( hey , that's the movie's explanation . . .  i'd marry renee zellweger in a second ) .  eventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it's the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever .  he essentially says to her , "" you win "" and hands her a ring .  the audience should now hate this character .  i did .  then the meat of the plot presents itself .  jimmie's grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business .  however , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) .  having blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a "" business proposition "" .  the movie wasn't half bad by this time , surprisingly .  it wasn't boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point .  ustinov's character left a video will , and while he's reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself "" what is this , brewster's millions ? "" .  as soon as i thought it , hal holbrook's character actually says "" what is this , brewster's millions ? ""  it was quite surreal .  something happens though during the film's final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive .  up to that point , all of jimmie's prior girlfriends had turned down his "" business proposition "" which i felt was good .  at least the film wasn't painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers .  when jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story .  at this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride .  these women arrive at jimmie's location and immediately start bullying him about what he's looking for in a woman .  when he's had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there's been a mistake and he won't be marrying any of them .  as a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off .  this goes on for the rest of the film .  it's just chris o'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women .  my groans of disgust could be heard for miles .  the film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day i'm still groaning .  the bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video .  it contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd-rom features .  the original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film .  apparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o'donnell around the city , and at one point o'donnell is leaping from the tops of buses .  so that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ?  ugh .

0|"forget get carter .  instead . . .  get me a cup of coffee .  what the hell has happened to all good american action movies ?  did i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ?  when did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980's -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads .  the only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don't mean new york city .  get carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80's action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown .  stallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up .  a few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey .  that role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul .  stallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past .  too bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges .  get carter is a simple story .  stallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) .  when frank's brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented "" carter's way "" .  he talks tough with his brother's wife , lends a helping had to his brother's daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee .  carter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough .  carter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties .  what a minute !  this sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey .  better not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off .  actually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) .  while stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose .  throughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously .  his one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character .  there is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words .  the biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke .  an amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character .  he may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book .  get carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud .  the only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting .  never mind that it should never have been made at all .

0|"roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , "" who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . .  ben kingsley ? ""  my response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it .  they should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles .  the same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious .  that is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast .  gary "" gal "" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain .  life has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing .  but his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch .  the first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa .  the second punch comes from gal's past .  back in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv's lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal .  he sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal .  don will accept any decision gal makes from "" yes "" to "" certainly . ""  however , if gal says "" no "" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy's ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) .  in the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody's skin .  kingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness .  there are some serious problems in louis mellis's and david scinto's script that should have been caught before filming .  when we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success .  beyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him .  any local hood could have done what gal is needed for .  additionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault .  no only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool .  in spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar .  i know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade .  the story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability .  the old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im .  it is not a great plot .  in sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards .  perhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film .  it is an old plot dressed up to look new .  if the plot is old , at least the style is creative .  this is director jonathan glazer's first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout .  his style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences .  cinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes .  we see one side of a person's faces .  but the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit .  half of everything that is happening is also kept hidden .  us yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog .  at least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language .  sexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film .  the plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western .  further respectability comes from ben kingsley's high-powered performance .  i give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

0|apparantly money talks .   .   .  and uses quite a bit of obscenities doing so !  i've always considered myself pretty open about the gratuity a film can possess , whether in language , violence , sex , or what have you .  i find that this fact gives me a little more leverage to complain when a movie goes overboard , and money talks definitely does !  it's not so much that the movie swore nearly constantly ( and i mean constantly ! ) , but it swore so much that it seemed overly prominent and way too staged .  perhaps if one character were foul mouthed , but in this film , everybody swears nearly every other word .  money talks is about a black ticket scalper named franklin hatchett ( played less annoyingly than expected by chris tucker ) .  franklin is your typical con-man and ends up with more than one person out to get him .  when the plot finally gets underway , there's no less than three people ( or groups ) that want him , dead or alive .  the frenchman who's somewhat responsible for franklin's escape from a prisoner-packed bus , a hoodlum whom franklin owes seven grand , and the cops who wrongly suspect him of murder .  franklin's only hope : james russell ( charlie sheen ) , an investigative reporter for the local news who's out to prove himself a worthy journalist .  james offers to help clear franklin's name if franklin will just allow him an exclusive report to help channel 12 conquer sweeps week .  both of these elements are completely lost along the way however , and never do reappear .  as expected , the odd couple of franklin and james do wind up friends at the end , which is another wasted element seeing as how they show no signs of becoming friends at any point along the way .  there is just nothing original or intriguing about this film , and so many developments are either non-relevant , or just plain forgotten about .  money talks is a paint-by-numbers movie that lacks any real involvment with the audience .  frivilous dialogue , a predictable , flat storyline , and two-dimensional characters make money talks a reason to save your money .  |-0.7333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|0.7666666666666666|"The general consensus is that the movie ""Money Talks"" receives negative sentiment due to its excessive swearing, lack of originality, predictable storyline, and two-dimensional characters, leading to a lack of engagement with the audience."
0|"starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see .  therefore , it's with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas .  despite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters .  a group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the "" savages "" that live there .  the natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust .  only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash .  the ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film's finer moments .  the characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth .  governor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses .  captain john smith is a blond hunk who , while "" slightly "" misguided , is good at heart .  pocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time .  she even comes complete with insignificant best friend .  again , against tradition , talking animals aren't used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is .  this is an odd compromise , but it's one of the few elements that really work .  the animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation .  maybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes .  the talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch .  the music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , "" colors of the wind . ""  mel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more .  the opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character .  i was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time .  even the children in the audience seemed restless .  while there's no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed .  perhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history .  it's all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie's entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn't work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer's minds and plot holes that are never filled .  even the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious .  as mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film .  for instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with "" savages , "" why did he so quickly change his previous "" kill as many indians as i can "" attitude .  if he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this .  or how about pocahontas' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ?  i can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway .  as it is , i wonder if it doesn't give kids the wrong impression .  in short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set .  while disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels .

( the short films are presented in order , btw ) :  the missing ingredient writer/director : allison anders starring : sammi davis , amanda decadenet , valeria golino , madonna , ione skye , lili taylor , alicia witt  this one starts it off horribly with no plot , no intrigue , and crap dialogue .  the situation is so terrible that it's physically painful to watch .  the plot has something to do with a coven of witches needing sperm to bring back a godess who is ( gasp ! )  stuck inside some object in their hotel room .  the witch that was supposed to bring it ( ione skye ) calls up ted and asks him if she can perform fellatio on him to get it .  yeah , that's what i said .  stupid plot , inane characters who aren't interesting at all , etc , etc , etc . the only good thing about this is it has a good cast which , in turn , it wastes pitifully .  not even actually funny for a second .  my rating ( out of 5 ) : no stars ! ! ! !  the wrong man writer/director : alexandre rockwell starring : david proval , jennifer beals and laurence bender  another bad little film with another stupid sex thing going on .  ted stumbles into the wrong room or something and gets in the middle of a couple ( david proval and jennifer beals in her attempt at "" coming back "" ) who are playing sex games .  ted tries to escape and we cheer him on so it will end soon .  but at least this has a bit of comedy in it , just not that much .  and david proval has never overacted as much .  and it's "" pulp fiction "" producer laurence bender who gets to puke from a window .  a masterpiece compared to the first one , but still . . .  the misbehavers writer/director : robert rodriguez starring : antonio banderes , tamlyn tomita , lana mckissack , danny verduzco , salma hayek  would a robert rodriguez film be the same without salma hayek's navel ?  nope .  luckily she's on the tv dancing so we get to see her .  surprisingly enough , when i read the screenplay ( about a year before actually seeing it ) , this one seemed to have the most potential .  it was fast-paced , funny , and well , funny .  but when i watched it , it seemed anti-climactic and only seemed to gain any momentum towards the end when everything happened at once .  antonio overacts nicely and the two kids ( lana and danny ) are funny .  but , as i said , it moves slowly and in that way , it's more painful than funny .  but the ending was stupid and funny at the same time .  oh !  the plot : antonio is a supposed gangster ( assumed , really ) who leaves his two troubling kids home while he and his wife ( tomita ) go out to get drunk at a new year's party .  antonio hires ted for a couple bucks to watch his kids all night long , but things go wrong . . . it  was okay .  the man from hollywood writer/director : quentin tarantino starring : quentin tarantino , bruce willis , paul calderon and jennifer beals ( again )  ironically , this one could be considered the best for a bad reason : it best represents what quentin has done with this film .  he plays chester , a spoiled brat actor or something who has just had a huge box-office hit on his hands and is living it up by playing an anti-climactic game from a hitchcock tv episode starring steve mcqueen and peter lorre where they gamble to see if one of them can get light from his lighter ten times in a row .  they're drunk and need sober but nervous ted to hold the cleaver and bring it down if the lighter doesn't light .  they also pay him a lot of cash .  this is so much exactly what this little film is about that it's campy .  tim roth was probably payed a lot of money to do this stupid part in this stupid film made by a bunch of people who are high on themselves 'cause they've had hits , major or minor .  it took quentin to realize that .  but the thing is , it doesn't seem like he realizes that .  if he did , i'd give this a good 3 stars .  but this sucked .  it was anti-climactic and the dialogue wasn't very good .  he starts off with a very long steadicam shot then goes to flashes .  that makes no sense .  it's cool for a while , then he makes it uneven .  it's long and it's just not very good .  hopefully quentin never repeats what he did with this one .  conclusion : what's the moral here ?  if you've made celebrated films , don't do an ensemble piece .  they should have re-watched "" new york stories "" and then stopped in their tracks .  none of these have any point to them and they're embarrassing to not only the writer/directors , but to the actors 'cause they're working with crap .  but i will forgive everyone involved and i especially look forward to quentin's next directing job ( even though he and rodriguez jumped back to the top immeadiately with the cool "" from dusk till dawn , "" which i found exhilerating ) .  i love quentin and i suppose it's good he made "" the man from hollywood "" because it makes him seem more realistic and not some "" god of cinema . ""  i seem to respect directors if they aren't "" gods "" and are actually human beings who make mistakes .   "" the man from hollywood "" is his big mistake and let's hope he doesn't return her continuously .

0|"you don't need to have seen the original "" species "" to appreciate how utterly lousy "" species ii "" is .  with few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that "" species ii "" is a follow-up isn't the only reason it's so miserable .  it's the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction .  the plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle .  the slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black .  that should have been the end of the movie right there .  back on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you'll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate .  on a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again "" played "" by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing .  this , apparently , includes observing eve's reaction to "" the dukes of hazzard "" tv show , which she appears to enjoy .  eve's bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk "" mates , "" which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail , but otherwise there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let's hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) .  eve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the finale , but the effects are so messy you can't really see what's going on .  peter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams "" i told 'em not to go ! ""  at the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle .  michael madsen reprises his role of press lennox ( so that he can enter high security areas , flash a badge and claim to be press , maybe ? ) , as does marg helgenberger as dr . laura baker , the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns .  they're both unbelievably wooden .  what's a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( "" the ruling class , "" "" the krays , "" "" let him have it "" ) doing directing this tripe , i wonder .  it's an unfortunate trend , this : once-talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like "" species ii . ""  last year peter hyams gave us "" the relic "" ; no thanks necessary there .  and the first "" species "" was helmed by roger donaldson who , although certainly no genius behind the camera , had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects .  is it just that there are no better offers out there ?   "" species ii "" is worthless .  worse than that , it's also exploitative , offensive , and insulting to the intelligence at every turn .  it's not that there isn't anything positive to say about the film .  there is .  after 92 minutes , it ends .

0|" "" something is fishy in the state of universal . ""  about ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post-apocalypse nitty-gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies .  we've always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on .  to date , the most smoothly done were straightforward "" haircuts "" of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim .  most of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane .   ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget . )  now we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter .   ( well , she's not a widow , and the kid isn't her daughter , but you get the idea . )  the lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn't given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script .  the child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she outshines her material all the way through .  in simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now .  the polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet .  the few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies , and survive by trade , theft , or piracy .  somehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries , and its inhabitants , called "" smokers , "" are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials , so the bad guys have outboard engines , and fast-moving boats , airplanes , and jet skis .  enola , found at sea as a young girl , has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back .  we suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical "" dryland , "" the place where trees , crops , and animals grow , and what plot there is hinges on who has enola .  the psycho ruler of the smokers , the "" deacon , "" is trying to get her and find his way to dryland .  played with typical self-lampooning , rug-chewing histrionics by dennis hopper , "" deacon "" is the only thing in the movie that's close to amusing .  his performance is * almost * laughable , but there just isn't enough there to be funny .  the star ( and a co-producer ) is kevin costner .  he's playing an un-named lone denizen of the sea , a man called the "" mariner , "" who turns out to be a gilled , water-breathing mutant with webbed feet .  very little is done with this .  the script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism ; it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted , much of the earth's surface would still be above water ; and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown .   ( canned meat does * not * last for centuries ; ammunition does * not * fire after it's more than a few decades old ; and so on , and so on . . . )  i'm quite fond of tina majorino's previous work , very impressed by jean tripplehorn's past accomplishments , and still speechless over costner's dances with wolves .  but this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it !  this movie cost one hundred and eighty-two million dollars , and there's * nothing * in it we haven't seen before , done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey .  at 125 minutes of material , this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make .  the budget of this movie * could * have given us over thirty movies ; it could have paid for six years of a prime-time sf tv series with expensive fx work , or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx .  in sum , this movie is beneath contempt .  it has nothing new to offer , it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc , and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation .  if you * have * to go see it , see it on a four-dollar matinee .  otherwise you'll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface , for weeks .
