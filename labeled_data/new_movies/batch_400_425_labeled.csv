1|"the happy bastard's 30-second review :  american pie  the summer of raunch continues to spread into theatres with this latest yuk fest , filled with sick jokes and teen dialogue aplenty .  if you go expecting dawson's creek , you're in for a problem .  if your expectations are lower ( and better , i might add ) , you will enjoy the hell out of american pie .  the movie casts several unknowns , with the only real recognizable one being sctv's own eugene levy as a happy-go-lucky dad .  the story revolves around four high school seniors who have one goal before the school year gets out- get laid .  that's pretty much it .  throughout the movie , little sick comic bits are sprinkled throughout , including a memorable scene involving an apple pie ( i won't give it away , but you probably know what it is ) and an internet broadcast gone horribly awry .  of course , the movie has some slightly sentimental bits , but they don't drag the movie's humor content down that bad .  most of the actors get their job done , but it's levy who's a hoot , a father who tries to talk sex with his son with the help of some curious "" visual aids "" .  i couldn't stop laughing during this movie , and if you can stand all the raunch and the sex references , then american pie is for you .  if you're one of those "" conservative "" types , well , i'll bet you're having fun at home while this , south park , and austin powers ii plays in theatres , now aren't you ?

1|"_in brief : _ this film needs no introduction .  if you haven't heard of it , then you must have been up in space on a sabbatical , and if you haven't seen it -- well , i suspect you're in a small minority !  first thing's first ? is it all it's hyped up to be ?  well , yes ? and no .  it's a good film , and there's a lot to like about it , but it's not without its problems .  when i saw the first trailer for "" titanic "" , it was when i went to see "" bean "" last summer , i think , my intial reaction was -- ain't that downright sick to make a disaster movie out of such a dreadful , real-life tragedy ? !  i mean , what's happened to hollywood's script-writers , have they run entirely out of new ideas ?  gads , whatever next , i asked myself , how about an action film based on hiroshima starring jean claude van damme ?  i was not entirely filled with anticipation , but then i wasn't alone in that respect .  it's when it came out in the cinema , to rave reviews ( well , mostly ) and anyone who'd been to see it seemed disturbingly obsessed by it that i started to take notice !  i didn't see the film until several months after its release ( by which time my sister had seen it about four times ! ) ,  so i went with a slightly more open mind , but i still didn't think i'd enjoy it much .  did i ? yes and no .  mainly yes , i'm happy to say .  the first hour or so was beautifully done , not so much because of the scripting ( i'll talk about that later ? ) but because the re-created ship and sets were stunning to look at , as was cameron's directing , and the performances of the principal cast were so strong that the "" human "" aspect of the story , the romance between rose ( kate winslet ) and jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , was enchanting .  the film is told via flashback , with gloria stuart playing the elderly rose in the modern day ( you knew that , a' course !   : - ) ) .  well , it's an often effective device to use in storytelling -- though sometimes it can fall flat .  does it work here ?  in script form it doesn't add all that much to the story .  what does add a lot to the story is gloria stuart , whose stunning performance is the strongest , most moving of the film .  her presence brings a much deeper level of passion , and depth to the story , and though her appearances are relatively brief , the film would have suffered without her .  also impressive are dicaprio and winslet , who wholly succeed in rising above the often poor dialogue , and the bond they form is both heartfelt and moving .  it's an old story , you know -- forbidden love ala romeo and juliet -- but it works , and jack's "" rescuing "" rose ( in both literal and figurative senses ) and teaching her to live life for what counts was pointed and touching .  in fact , i enjoyed the first half of the film a lot , largely because winslet and dicaprio bring such and charm , energy to the romance .  it's engaging , touching and very enjoyable .  there's more than a tinge of poignancy to it as well , simply because you know it's not going to be a happy ending .  which leads us to the second half of the film .  we all knew it was coming .  i'm sure director cameron was looking forward with eager anticipation to it , because as he's stated in interviews , the real thrust of the story ( for him ) was the sinking , and the jack/rose romance was a merely a manipulative plot device to get you emotionally into the film .  i think that understates the importance of the romance , as i found it far more enjoyable than an hour of watching people die .  the iceberg arrives , and the captain announces that titanic will have sunk in about an hour .  and it is an hour .  my goodness , we don't miss a second of that hour ?  gratuitous ? well , perhaps not by today's standards , i'm sure there's been far worse produced under the banner of "" entertainment "" in other films .  but i certainly wasn't prepared for how shocking and graphic the last hour or so would be .  not that i'd expect the word "" understatement "" to be part of cameron's vocabulary ( he who brought us such , umm , vivid films as "" terminator 2 "" and "" aliens "" ) .  is it overdone ?  i thought so .  understatement can sometimes work wonders in conveying tragedy .  no , no one expected a happy ending , but i didn't quite expect the horrendously shocking and powerful scenes we were bombarded throughout the film's second half .  still , whether it was overdone and heavy-handed or not , if it was the shock-factor cameron was after it worked , because i was shocked and moved , in fact i spent most of the last hour in tears !  you really couldn't help but get emotionally involved , whether it was wishing someone would knock that dreadfully psychotic fiance of rose's overboard or desperately hoping that rose would rescue jack , or that jack would rescue rose , or that they would both survive .  perhaps the most harrowing scene was when the ship has sunk , and those that sunk along with the ship freeze to death on the water surface .  the bit where rose lets go of jack's hand , while promising she'll never let go in her heart was particularly heart-wrenching , and the sight of rescue boats sailing amid the ocean of corpses was a pretty powerful image , to put no fine a point on it .  i loved the ending , however , which was both moving and slightly uplifting following the horror of the past hour and a half .  so , we've established that the film is powerful and moving , if the last hour was rather excessive .  haven't mentioned the script .  plot-wise it's ok , though the jack/rose relationship was beautifully developed , but i've a feeling that's to the actors credit if anything .  as for the dialogue ? well , titanic is set in 1912 .  it's a period drama .  but i saw very little indication of period in so far as the dialogue is concerned .  did they really use phrases like "" goddamn it ! ""  back in the turn of the century ?  i doubt it .  would someone talk like this : "" do ya love the guy or what ? "" .  i doubt it .  is such dialogue as "" i saw the iceberg , and i see it in your eyes now "" not just a bit ? clumsy ?  yes it is .  a little more attention to dialogue would not have gone astray , and cameron himself is to blame ( he wrote the script ) .  stick with directing , dude .  but its more than redeemed by the acting , with dicaprio and winslet on fine form , ably supported by a strong cast .  star of the show was gloria stuart , though -- why didn't she win that oscar ? !  after all , they were throwing oscars at "" titanic "" left , right and centre , but gloria was perhaps the most deserving nominee .  directing-wise cameron does a spectacular job .  like i said , his vision was a bit excessive , but at least he directed it well .  i haven't even mentioned james horner's beautiful score .  utterly heavenly , though when your dad and sister play the soundtrack a lot you do start to get a bit bored with it !   ; - )  i've finished my rant , which lasted a lot longer than i thought it would !  just leaves a couple of questions ; was it worth all those oscars ?  hell , don't talk to me about oscars .  bloomin' farce .  it was deserving in a number of departments , though .  last question ; is it , as some suggest , one of the best films of all-time ?  nope , i don't think so .  it's certainly one of the most powerful and memorable films i've ever seen , but i don't think it quite ranks as one of my all-time favourites .  and as for the fact they're reportedly making a "" titanic 2 "" ? well i guess that's typical hollywood for you !

1|in some respects , rush hour is the ultimate exercise in cliched filmmaking .  the hero is the renegade cop that prefers to work alone .  the cop in question cannot solve the case until he gets in trouble .  all chinese people are somehow involved in the criminal element .  the duo must always be completely mismatched .  the hero has to say some smart-assed comment before ( and after ) shooting someone .  however , that doesn't necessarily make for a bad film .  rush hour is jackie chan's first major hollywood film since the dismal the protector ( 1985 ) .  proving once again that hollywood can learn many things from foreign film markets ( ie : hong kong ) , jackie chan is given much more free reign than before .  still , some die-hard jackie chan fans may be disappointed , as even chan himself has voiced displeasure over the length of the fight scenes ( which he views as too short , according to one interview ) .  this film takes a familiar theme of east meets west .  jackie chan is lee , the straight laced inspector who is imported to help deal with a kidnapping case , while chris tucker is carter , the loudmouthed , destructive cop that is `promoted' to the fbi to help him .  or , at least , so he thinks ( also another classic notion in action films : the fbi must always get in the way of our heroes ) .  despite the necessary conventions of action films , rush hour is some of the most fun you'll spend and hour and forty minutes watching .  jackie chan continues to be one of the most exciting martial artists on the big screen , continuing to perform his own stunts and dazzling audiences with his flashy kicks and punches .  chris tucker , familiar from his whiny , annoying role in the fifth element is more palatable , complementing jackie chan's straight-laced character .  however , jackie chan still maintains his comic-slapstick edge , as expected of him and his films .  perfectly downplaying the `fish-out-of-water' routine through his character's attempts at mixing into american culture , he makes up for the down time his character experiences .  when he is in action , however , you'll be amused and dazzled .  still being inventive in the use of objects to beat people up ( in this case , a steering wheel , a serving tray , and a barstool ) , jackie chan proves to be the pioneer of slapstick kung fu .  chris tucker's character may come across as irritating , yet is also humorous .  since he's not a physical actor to the level of jackie chan , he uses his main weapon : his mouth ( hence , the tagline , `fastest hands in the east meets the fastest mouth in the west' ) .  while dialogue is not necessarily shakespeare , it is appropriate for the film and still very funny .  while not necessarily poignant , attempts at character development and growth between characters come off surprisingly well .  lee's `knowledge' of american pop culture ( `that's the beach boys ! ' )  when contrasted against carter's lack of knowledge of chinese culture makes for an interesting scene where lee teaches carter the kung fu disarming trick , while carter teaches lee hip-hop dance moves .  while rush hour is not at the same level as police story 3 and 4 ( known in north america as supercop and jackie chan's first strike , respectively ) , it more than makes up for the poorly received films operation condor and mr . nice guy .  with its appropriate mixture of high kicks and lots of laughs , it makes for a fun film .  as well , it is a true departure from jackie chan films , as it is missing one common element : a whiny female co-star .  |-0.3666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|The text presents a mixed sentiment towards the film, highlighting both negative aspects such as the use of cliches and stereotypes, and positive aspects such as Jackie Chan's impressive martial arts skills and the entertaining nature of the movie.

1|the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/director/producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director , he really is .  he wrote this film , he directed this film , he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film .  i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it's popularity or it's ability to scare the wits out of people .  i think i have seen 'halloween' over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant , and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen .  i own three different versions of the film : a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t-shirt , a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re-mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation , in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow-globe .  in other words i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film .  it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2 , 4 , and 7 being truly good .  it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan .  since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30 , 000 copies , i knew i had to buy one no matter what !  i did and man to me it's the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film .  no words can describe the dvd .  in 'halloween' michael myers is a evil person whom killed his sister in cold blood 16 years ago in 1963 .  now in 1978 grown up and in a mental hospital michael myers escapes to go back to his hometown of haddonfield , illinois , followed by his past doctor sam loomis .  the person michael is targeting is laurie strode who is played by jamie lee curtis in her film debut .  why is he stalking her ?  check out halloween ii it explains it all .  on this unholy night on october 31 , 1978 laurie strode and her two friends are going to have the time of their lives , which is trying to stay alive .  the whole film is filled with terrifying moments most coming from just seeing michael myers walk .  nick castle who played the shape in the first movie did an incredible job , and no other person in any other halloween flick can do what he did .  what john carpenter did in 1978 is made a ground-breaking new film , with scares , wit , and style .  the movie is flawless if not perfect .  no other movie or sequel has lived up to this one , and in my opinion never will .  'halloween' will be like 'psycho' and still be extremely popular even almost 40 years later .  i just hope someday 'halloween' will be released in a new dolby soundtrack with the 4 extra scenes on the dvd edition .  'halloween' isn't just another slice-and-dice horror flick , it's an intelligent , horrifying and best film experience ever made .  see 'halloween' and be scared . . . . then  watch it again !  reviewed by brandon herring october 7 , 1999 .  |0.7749999999999999|0.9|0.7833333333333333|"The user's review of the movie ""Halloween"" is highly positive, expressing admiration for the film's direction, score, and impact on the horror genre.

1|"i have to admit that i disliked this film initially .  it certianly isn't for every taste , and it's sheer torture to sit through if you're in a restless mood .  that said , if you are in the right mood , it's absolutely incredible .  this was my second favorite movie of 1998 , and would have been a shoo-in for first in almost any other year .  perhaps the big turn-off for many was this film's unconventionality .  i'd be hard-pressed to compare it to any other film that i've seen - it is very , very artsy , incredibly slow - and amazingly , it works beautifully .  on my second viewing , i realized that the film follows the three act structure ( i didn't think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it ) .  the first act serves to set up the characters - sort of .  it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness , and perhaps even feelings of boredom .  and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second ( which encompasses most of the movie ) .  the majority of the film is one extended battle scene , intercut with brief flashbacks and voice-overs .  the artsier elements do not detract from the action , but add to it - they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers , only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes .  the battle scenes are amazing ( second only to "" saving private ryan "" in my opinion ) .  they're brutal , horrifying , and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography .  the second act is as immersive , brilliant , and haunting as any film that i have ever seen .  the only problems come during the first and third acts .  malick takes a little too long to get the film started .  although the initial scenes - which consist of two soldiers' experiencing a near-eden-like paradise while going awol , and the preperations for battle - are effective and necessary , hints of pretentiousness sink in .  the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning , and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this .  the final act is effective at winding the film down , but the problems from the first persist - it's a bit too long , and comes over as pretentious at times .  that said , there are two sequences ( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his wife , and another where one of the main characters is killed ) that are nothing short of incredible .  the performances are phenominal all around .  the two standouts are nick nolte and newcomer jim caviezel , both of whom should have been nominated for oscars .  nolte is riveting and intense as the colonel in charge of the operation .  his character is hard , mean , and somewhat reckless with the lives of his men , and yet nolte somehow manages to evoke sympathy for him .  caviezel is forever questioning the nature of war , his place in it , and if there's any deeper meaning to the hell that he's going through .  he is absolutely perfect - genuine , sympathetic , sincere , and yet strong when he needs to be .  although restricted to a relatively small role , sean penn is also very good as the company's pessimistic seargent .  as to how it stacks up to "" saving private ryan "" - it was my second favorite movie of 1998 , "" ryan "" was my first .  it's really hard to compare the two - they are so , so different - so i won't , beyond saying that spielberg's film had more of an impact on me .  however , the two are comparable from the standpoint of quality ( i can easily see why someone would "" the thin red line "" above "" ryan ) .  i highly recommend both of them , and consider them to be the two best war movies ever made .  all in all , "" the thin red line "" is filmmaking of an incredibly high order .  it's slight faults are easily offset by the sheer brilliance of what is done right .  it's a real shame that it tanked at the box office - films this unconventional , powerful , and thought-provoking don't come along very often .

1|"it was a rainy friday afternoon in columbus when i persuaded a friend to see a matinee performance of mst3k : tm .  he had never seen any episodes of the show , and i have watched a scant few , due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes .  for those of you not familiar with the premise , dr clayton forrester ( beaulieu ) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public .  to achieve this , he ( in the words of the tv series' theme , which is missing in the movie ) "" bumped [mike nelson ( nelson ) ] on the noggin and then shot him into space "" , and is monitoring nelson's reactions to the movies he is forced to endure .  rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies , nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions , tom servo and crow t . robot .  the format of the show consists of nelson , servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched , and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love , the ship on which our heroes are marooned .  only two things are different in the movie : the absence of forrester's sidekick , tv's frank , and the slower pace of the jokes .  this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke .  for their big screen outing , the producers have chosen "" this island earth "" , a 1954 classic , and one of the first sf films to have a special effects budget larger than the average grocery bill .  unfortunately for that film ( but making it ideal mst3k fodder ) , acting and dialogue appear to have taken a back seat to the effects which , by today's standards , are less than impressive .  nelson & co . make jokes about everything from japan's dominance in the world market , to star trek , to the state of disrepair of seattle's kingdome , and most of them work .  unfortunately , the segments set outside the satellite's movie theater seem out of place and aren't particularly funny , but at least they're fairly short .  the big question about this movie though is : why ?  i presume it was an attempt to gain a larger following to keep support behind the series ( rumours of its impending demise circulated for some time before the plug was eventually pulled a few months ago ) , but the format gains nothing from its transition to the big screen -- there are no special effects to dazzle you , no action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat , and no use of digital surround sound .  so , it seems pointless to spend $8 per person to see this movie when in a few months it will be out on video and you can watch it for $3 , and not have to sit in a room full of popcorn addicts .  nevertheless , mst3k : tm provides more laugh-out-loud opportunities than any film you're going to see this year , and i thoroughly recommend it to anyone with a pulse .  given its uniqueness , i hesitate to grade it against other films , but it fulfils its claims and so in the class of "" unsubtle comedy films whose laughs come at the expense of bad b-movies "" it does well .

1|"the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau's intimacy has already garnered much notoriety , but it's in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance ( angels & insects ) and kerry fox ( welcome to sarajevo ) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered .  with sharp , intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity , rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols .  their sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty , in the acceptance of flesh and messiness .  less apparent , but no less remarkable , are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance , often without a single line of dialogue .  not aiming for the spiritual poetry of in the realm of the senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash , chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development .  that may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive but never particularly significant on more than a tactile , sensory level .  the themes of human isolation are barren and obvious , a science project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis .  intimacy does manage to stand out from lesser portraits of "" human interconnectedness "" and pinter-esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers ( okay , kill me ) .  shallow though it might sound , it's amazing how much is filled in through an inspired cast , perceptive camerawork , and imaginative ways of treating the love scene .  those ingredients are too assured and confident to merely dismiss as icing on the cake , especially since they are the substance of the cake itself .  adapted from a pair of short stories by british novelist hanif kureishi , intimacy weaves desperate lovemaking between two strangers in london .  every wednesday , jay ( rylance ) and claire ( fox ) meet in his cluttered , dank apartment for an hour or two of sexual release from their uninspired lives .  he's been head bartender at a posh restaurant for over six years .  she's a mystery to him but her glum workaday appearance reveals a similar dissatisfaction .  they're both married , but his relationship has curdled into an embittered separation .  as the weeks draw on , jay obsessively takes it upon himself to uncover claire's personal routines .  in his attempt to gain a fuller semblance of who she is , he opens wounds that hadn't existed before by single-handedly corrupting the fantasy .  if it weren't for a few unnecessary subplots involving jay's brother and his bevy of disgruntled co-workers , this minimalist premise might be described as a modern fable on the perils of wish fulfillment .  chareau's restless camera ( once again wielded by superb and ever-attentive cinematographer eric gautier ) is less appropriate here than in his family transit-oriented those who love me can take the train .  the scenes that linger are the still ones where rylance and fox separately , pensively attempt to carry on with their makeshift household routines .  these are often captured in lingering , unblinking wide shots that view them stranded amidst their drab workplaces and homes .  separation proves haunting in a melancholy series of intercut shots as rylance and fox undress on opposite sides of the room , crawling across the floor to meet in the center .  despite being as restless as a fly during the hyperactive restaurant scenes ( all the better to blend in with a hustling crowd of gabby trendsetters ) , you'd be hard pressed to find a single uninteresting image .  intimacy takes an interest in its sordid world of the lower-middle class , with lonely pubs and busy shopping streets -- it also understands the people who inhabit those spaces , viewing them with sympathy scraped raw .  an evaluation would be incomplete without highlighting the great timothy spall ( the robust scene-stealer of many a mike leigh collaboration ) .  as claire's cuckolded husband , this jocular heavyweight plays out his handful of bitter pill scenes with the unforced menace and self-effacing embarrassment of his imposing bulk .  bangs in his eyes , his mouth forming into quizzical pouts and dry smirks , he may seem the fool in his barroom encounters opposite a sarcastic , gleaming mark rylance ( whose jay has arrived on the scene looking to stir up some trouble ) , but spall is no one to trifle with .  his overreaching best pal demeanor suggests a mind abuzz with secret passageways of guile , his pointed questions only na ? ve if you choose not to read into their crafty insinuations .  in his unassuming way , spall's carefully etched interpretation of hostility buried under a mountain of surface propriety may become one of the most criminally underappreciated performances of the year , but maybe also one of the best .  he's that good .

1|"george little ( jonathan lipnicki ) wants a little brother .  after mr . and mrs . little ( hugh laurie and geena davis ) visit the orphange , they decide to adopt stuart , a talking mouse ( voiced by michael j . fox ) .  george isn't so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house , and neither is snowbell the family cat ( voiced by nathan lane ) .  george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race , but snowbell wants stuart out of the house ( he's unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it's ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat ) .  stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery ( cgi ) .  the character of stuart , while obviously a computer generated image , grows on you as the film progresses and you'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect .  there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film , as many of the "" supporting cast "" are actual cats ( with computer animated mouths so they can speak ) .  it's fascinating to watch these cats give performances without an actual mouse to interact with .  stuart little is a charming family film .  there are some great laughs in the movie ( with a script co-written by the sixth sense's m . night shyamalan no less ! ) ,  some moments that can only be described as "" too cute "" ( the boat race sequence is what won me over ) and even the majority of the one-liners ( common nowadays in children's films or films featuring nathan lane ) are tolerable .  kids and parents will love this one .  stuart little is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video .  there are two different dvds on sale : one contains the film in full frame , and the other presents the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 66 : 1 .  both versions feature choices of either dolby surround or dolby digital 5 . 1 audio .  both versions also contain the following extras ( and hang in there with me here . . . there's a lot of them ) : a full length audio commentary track by director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson , a full length audio commentary track by the visual effects supervisors , an isolated score track , an interactive trivia game , an interactive featurette that goes step by step through eight of the effects in the film , a making of documentary that originally aried on hbo , and a stuart little read-along story ( which you can read yourself or have stuart read for you ) .  there are also three music videos , and six theatrical trailers ( called thecatrical trailers . . .  get it ?  it's funny ! ) for stuart little and five other columbia tristar releases : the adventures of elmo in grouchland , madeline , the nuttiest nutcracker , muppets from space , and baby geniuses ( the only bad thing about this entire dvd . . .  i did not want to be reminded of the awfulness that is baby geniuses ) .  dvd-rom features are also on the disc , including web links and a demo of the stuart little cd-rom game .  but wait . . .  there's still more !  there's a section called "" basement treasures "" where you will find the auditions of the film's animators , six deleted scenes which you can select to view with or without commentary from the director , a visual effects gag reel , a production gag reel , and an incredible eight minute storyboard sequence detailing the original concept for the boat race scene ( with commentary from the director ) .  the first commentary track features director rob minkoff and animation supervisor henry anderson .  they give insightful and detailed thoughts about the film's production .  minkoff likes to point out scenes where other screenwriters came in and polished up the script , namely writers like scott alexander and larry karaszewski ( who wrote the people vs . larry flynt and ed wood ) and lowell ganz and babaloo mandel ( who wrote splash and multiplicity , among others ) .  anderson is very appreciative of the animators who worked with him and often points out which animator worked on each scene as they occur .  the second commentary track features visual effects supervisors john dykstra and jerome chen who discuss more specific details of the effects in the film .  movie fans will enjoy the informative first commentary track , serious animation buffs will love the second one .  now i know this is slightly off topic , but it is related specifically to this dvd so i must voice this now .  one of the music videos on the disc is for a song called "" i need to know "" by a group called r angels .  this video features four mid-teenage girls ( the singers obviously ) having a slumber party .  the girls ask a ouija board "" i need to know . . .  who to do , who to do , who to do "" as the song begins .  they then sneak out of their house , and along the way they strike a pose and their slumber party pajamas are magically transformed into middle class streetwalker outfits .  then they head to a party and dance suggestively with the guys while singing lyrics like "" i'll be your pleasure all the time . . .  just say the words that you'll be mine "" .  um . . .  what the hell ?  what does this have to do with stuart little ?  how is this in any way a song suitable for a kids movie , let alone a video suitable for a kids movie on dvd ?  when the video concludes , the words "" to be continued "" appear .  oh i can't wait to see who they've slept with when the toy story 2 dvd comes out .  kids won't care about most of the special features on this dvd , but those of us who can sometimes be turned into a "" kid at heart "" thanks to a winning family film sure appreciate them .  this is the way to do dvd , a good movie loaded with great features at a reasonable cost .  the di$ney people could learn a lot from columbia tristar .

1|"countries and legal systems that take the rule of law principle seriously , had forbidden judges and juries to make judgements in all matters that could involve them personally .  luckily , movie reviewers aren't burdened with such legislation .  otherwise , small pool of very special movies would be forever ignored by this reviewer .  in case of star wars , 1977 science fiction epic by george lucas , the consequences would be even more severe , because that film is very special for tens of millions , if not hundreds of millions of fans .  in any case , objectivity is something seldom seen in star wars reviews , because undisputed majority of reviewers rate it as one of the best , if not the best film of all times .  those who don't usually have some difficulties in hiding their artistic snobbery .  the author of this review must also concede his inability to use cold , objective standards in reviewing this film .  like so many previous reviewers , i must note that i watched star wars for the first time twenty years ago , and that i remained enchanted by the experience ever since .  perhaps it was childlike fascination with , until then unimaginable , wonders that happened long time ago , in a galaxy far away .  or perhaps it was the rush i felt minutes before the opening shots , with my expectations already pumped up by serialised comic books and novelisation i had read before .  anyway , watching of star wars was one of the most important movie going experiences of my life .  and it was also unmatched for many years to come , because very few movies managed to have such a strong impact on me like george lucas' epic .  star wars wasn't just important movie for me ( or the millions of fans who probably share the same sentiment ) .  it was the defining moment in the history of modern cinema .  until than , american motion picture industry was in a limbo ; social turmoil in 1960s practically destroyed the old hollywood , and new authors filled the void , mostly by using hollywood's financial and technical resources to create serious , "" personal "" or "" artsy "" movies .  as a result , audience , traumatised of dark reality of vietnam and watergate , didn't want to see the same dark and serious content on the silver screen .  george lucas with its science fiction epic was among the first to come into rescue .  the audience responded with unprecedented enthusiasm , and huge financial success of the movie , later backed by supplement industry of toys , books , comics , role playing games and other merchandise , slowly began to change the face of hollywood .  serious , adult movies with artistic ambitions faded into oblivion , and were replaced by industrial products of "" blockbuster "" philosophy .  one of the biggest casualties of that trend was the science fiction movie genre .  until 1977 , science fiction movies were mostly in b-production domain .  in late 1960s , bigger budgets for science fiction didn't look so strange anymore , thanks to the great success of 2001 : a space odyssey .  but the same success coincided with the surge of pesimism , and hollywood science fiction was as bleak as the rest of its production - mostly dark , dystopic movies .  however , in 1977 star wars showed once and for all that this genre can be inspiration for popular movies , even among the audience that usually doesn't like it .  as a result , seriousness in cinematic science fiction began fading away , although some good , dark and cult quality sf and continued to be filmed until early 1980s .  after that , science fiction continued to be considered a synonym for family entertainment .  ironically , the man responsible for star wars was in its time considered to be member of "" new hollywood "" generation of young movie authors who made "" artsy "" and "" personal "" films in early 1970s .  george lucas established himself with the dystopic sf movie thx 1138 , and nostalgic drama american graffiti .  both movies were considered "" personal "" in its time , despite latter one becoming very popular .  in a sense , star wars is an also very "" personal "" film , and the thorny way to the final production shows that commercial considerations were against it , not for it .  but unlike many "" personal "" movies of the era , its "" personality "" was in line with the wishes of the general audience .  the plot , set "" a long time ago , in a galaxy far away "" , begins in a time of civil war .  the evil empire is threatened by rebels who want to restore the old republic .  in order to quash any opposition , the empire had built death star , superweapon powerful enough to destroy whole planets .  the information about death star , acquired by rebel intelligence , is being transported by princess leia organa ( carrie fisher ) when her ship gets intercepted by imperial cruiser .  princess is arrested by imperial warlord darth vader ( played by david prowse and voice by james earl jones ) , but the information is being sent to nearby desert planet of tatooine via two humanoid robots - c3po ( anthony daniels ) and r2d2 ( kenny baker ) .  those two robots are sold to the family of luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , young restless man who wants to leave his farm and become space pilot .  his adventure begins when r2d2 escapes , because the information must reach mysterious local hermit obi wan kenobi ( alec guiness ) .  old man is actually the last surviving jedi knight , member of the ancient order that defended republic through the use of mystical force .  after some hesitation , luke agrees to join obi wan in his mission to save the princess , while the old man would teach him the ways of the force .  their small band comes to the colourful spaceport of moss eisely , where they hire the spaceship owned by rogue pilot han solo ( harrison ford ) and his furry sidekick chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) .  critics who don't like the movie , especially those who can't forgive lucas for his contribution to the quashing of "" new hollywood "" , are prone to point the lack of originality .  on the surface , they might be right ; lucas himself admits that he found a lot of inspiration in the lore of old hollywood - westerns , wwii aviation movies , old sf cliffhanger serials of the 1930s and 1940s ; yet the most obvious element would be akira kurosawa's samurai classic the hidden fortress .  on the other hand , those who had spent last two decades studying the movie to death would say that the inspiration for star wars went even further - into collective subconscious of western civilisation ( hinted by some mild tolkien references ) .  the others would find the author's element within the story - star wars could be seen as an anti- establishment film ; young , long-haired , easy going , nature-loving heroes are fighting against old , uptight and oppressive forces who use supertechnology in most demonic purposes .  even out of its historical or social context , star wars is an impressive as a strictly technical piece of the seven art .  george lucas' direction is very good , with the clever editing and a well-paced segments between action and dramatic buildup .  characters are well-drawn and deliver all the necessary ingredients , both for the space opera and hollywood blockbuster .  we have a "" coming-of-age "" hero , damsel-in-distress ( somewhat toned down due to the popular feminist trends of the time ) , reluctant helper , benevolent mentor , diabolical villain and , finally , comic relief in form of two non-human characters .  some of the actors are very good - alec guiness in his most famous role to date , james earl jones whose voice is enough to cause unease , peter cushing as an incarnation of pure evil in human form .  unfortunately , the same can't be said for the main leads - among the main trio of mark hamill , carrie fisher and harrison ford , only the last one had the character three-dimensional enough to launch his further acting career .  the thing that looked like the most important segment of star wars phenomena during its initial release was the new level of special effects technology .  often comparisons with 2001 : space odyssey , another ground-breaking sf film , were citing the sheer number of effects as a proof of the lucas' superiority over kubrick .  however , the special effects by john dykstra and john stears are indeed impressive , even after two decades ( although 1997 special edition did improve them significantly ) , yet they aren't the most remembered trademark of the movie .  that honour should definitely go to the "" oscar "" -winning soundtrack by john williams , whose work on star wars is probably the brightest gem in his brilliant career .  newer generations of viewers might be somewhat deprived of the enchantment that still holds those lucky enough to witness star wars original release .  yet , even if they are immune to the george lucas' magic they should watch this film nevertheless , perhaps only to become familiar with something that is essential part of contemporary culture .

1|" "" psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred "" .  a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget , third rate rip-off .  but no , this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria , perhaps italian horror director dario argento's most consistently successful film .  what impresses most in re-watching this surrealistic , supernatural thriller is that argento's directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near-fully coherent narrative .  screenplays have always been his achilles heel ; confusing subplots , gaping holes , totally illogical incidents and reactions .  no question : argento has always been a better director than a writer .  fortunately , he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria , taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called "" suspiria de profundis "" .  the film's storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic , provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches .  jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance .  arriving at the school late at night in driving rain , she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state .  what happens next - and i don't make the comparison lightly - is a murder sequence that for intensity , shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock's infamous shower scene in psycho .  it's quite possibly a homage to hitchcock , but with its baroque sets , graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin , this stunning sequence remains very much argento's own .  though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria's opening 15 minutes , the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school .  we meet an assortment of slightly sinister characters , most notably the head ballet teacher played by alida valli in another one of those delicious sour-old-matriarch-from-hell roles she does so well .  several more violent murders ensue , including a startling scene in a deserted square where a blind man is . . . well , i wouldn't want to spoil things now , would i ? and the film's climax , staged amid secret corridors and hidden rooms , has a gothic ghoulishness that's most impressive .  the english language versions of most argento movies usually suffer trimming , and not just for the violence - deep red and phenomena , for example , have been appallingly hacked about .  fortunately , the cuts to suspiria ( about 7 minutes in this version ) have not adversely affected the film .  the dubbing of the italian actors into english is quite competently done , too , excepting one appalling and unintentionally hilarious effort with a conversation between harper and a professor about the history of witchcraft in the region .  and the soundtrack ?  it is interesting to imagine what power the film would have lost if it had been scored by someone else .  as it stands , the use of goblin's music in suspiria is outstanding .  apparently , argento played the soundtrack on location while filming so the actors could hear the music as they acted out their parts .  a stereo video player adds greatly to the viewer's overall experience .  even better , see suspiria in a cinema , where you'll get the added bonus of widescreen .  and the colours !  deep reds , eerie blues , a superb use of shadow and contrast .  the cinematography of luciano tovoli , whose more recent credits include reversal of fortune and single white female , is uniformly superb .  a nod also must go to production designer giuseppe bassan for his wonderful baroque interiors .  these kinds of settings are crucial to the atmosphere of argento's more surreal excursions , the other most notable example being inferno ( 1980 ) on which bassan also worked .  suspiria is the film that broke dario argento into the major league of european directors , and it is fully deserving of its cult status .  the gore is at times a little excessive and overstated - that's always been one of argento's shortcomings - but overall this is a fascinating , compelling example of italian horror .

1|"jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation .  even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation .  this is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction .  to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk 'til dawn .  he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide .   ( i'm willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him . )  tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director's helm .  nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own .  the film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her .  jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas .  this makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico .  however , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs .  jackie didn't know they were in the package with the cash , but that's of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted .  of course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell .  ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police .  sure enough , ordell shows up at jackie's apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she "" borrows "" max's pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell .  instead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol's chamber to ordell's head , jackie proposes a deal .  since ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell's half million dollars .  with a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ?  by itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film .  however , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think .  jackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she's also making a deal with the feds as well as with max .  the film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around .  instead , it's actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today's movies .  at least this film has a little imagination .  most of the performances in jackie brown are above par .  pam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable .  samuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control .  robert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . .  never mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy's apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course .  he's just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn't occur to us , even when we're shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade .  in supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell's , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town .  unfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences .  in this film , he's not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , "" little bit , "" and "" pretty much . ""  fonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side .  as is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy .  it grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves .  don't count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however .  there's a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he's not really sure what's happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what's going on is felt simultaneously by the audience .  we look at the screen and think , "" gee , that's clever , "" and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on .  although tarantino isn't afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film .  there are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head .  this is a tribute to both direction and acting .  however , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something .  we get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she's looking for , but instead hoping she'll just stop .  overall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well .  some flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it's really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today .  in fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these "" offensive "" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness .  go see the film and see what i mean .

( while the depiction is not biblically accurate , it is entertaining and might be excuse enough to familiarize ourselves with the true record by reading what is written in genesis 7 . )  a positive note is that the studio has avoided any segment which is as perversely dark as nihgt on bald mountain upon which the original film ended .  there are some images based upon fantasy such as the flying whales in respighi's pines of rome or images which have their roots in mythology such as the ethereal creatures which tell the story of nature's cycle of life , death , and rebirth in igor stravinsky's firebird suite .  but the stories they tell are uplifting , containing nothing too frightening for our younger children .  the darkest segment , spiritually speaking , actually belongs to the only holdover from the original fantasia , mickey mouse in the sorcerer's apprentice by paul dukas .  but overall , the emotions evoked from fantasia 2000 are positive ones , being full of hope and promise .  music has an impact which can be undeniably felt , capable of leading the listener to emotional peaks and inspirational highs simply not attainable through other mediums .  it is no wonder that the levites , as the priestly tribe of the old testament , were also the appointed musicians .  if fantasia 2000 is able to introduce a new audience to music which inspires and exalts , it will have done an incredible service .  |0.6333333333333334|0.85|0.7666666666666666|"The summary explanation is that the sentiment of the text is predominantly positive as it praises the movie ""Fantasia 2000"" for its blend of classical music and animation, its impact and beauty, and its ability to evoke positive emotions and inspire the audience.

1|ingredients : little orphan boy , rural grandparents , mountains , native american lore  synopsis : in this loving film portrayal of an idyllic and pivotal time that a young boy spends with grandpa and grandma , the self recollections of an unseen narrator focus on his world view as a tennessee orphan boy learning of his heritage through his grandparents .  the setting is after the first world war , during the great depression years .  a nine-year-old orphan named little tree ( joseph ashton ) is taken in and taught the wondrous ways of the woods by his caucasian moonshiner grandpa ( james cromwell ) and his native american grandma ( tantoo cardinal ) in the wilderness of the mountains of tennessee .  here little tree learns an almost magical appreciation for nature and farm life - - and experiences beautiful and wondrous things such as the sunrise .  everything is miraculous to a child .  but it all comes crashing down for the boy when the u . s . government forcibly takes custody away from grandpa and grandma , and forces little tree to attend the notched gap boarding school , a kind of internment camp where multiracial cherokee kids are indoctrinated to dress , pray , speak , and think like white people or face solitary confinement and corporeal punishment .  through his childhood experiences , little tree learns lessons about love , race , life , death , people , nature , and folk wisdom .  opinion : this excellent , excellent family movie .  it is one of those priceless screen gems that nobody knows about because it's not highly advertised .  you won't find any formula schlock , cutesy characters , canned spirituality , sequel teasers or commercial tie ins , but you will find the education of little tree to be a refreshing , impeccably acted , original , wonderful , and touching film .  take the whole family and bring a box of tissues for the tearjerkers .  this one's as good as old yeller .  |0.7666666666666666|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|The overall consensus is that the movie is highly praised for its positive sentiment, excellent acting, originality, and emotional moments, making it a recommended family film that may require tissues.
1|"disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure , mulan .  while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect , it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults .  fa mulan ( ming-na wen , singing : lea salonga ) wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family . . . it's  just that she doesn't quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time .  while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker ( miriam margoyles ) , mulan would prefer speaking her mind .  but there is trouble on the horizon .  the evil huns , led by shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) , are invading china .  the emperor ( pat morita ) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army .  the only male in mulan's family is her father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) , who , old and with a bad leg , honorably accepts his fate .  mulan , on the other hand , decides to save her father's life . . . by  secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield .  mulan , under the assumed name of ping , appears at camp where she , along with the other bumbling recruits , yao ( harvey fierstein ) , chien-po ( jerry tondo ) and ling ( gedde watanabe ) , are trained in the art of war by captain shang ( b . d .  wong , singing : donny osmond ) .  but she's not alone in her tasks . . . in  typical disney fashion , she has three animal companions : her horse khan , a lucky cricket crickey , and a pint-sized "" guardian "" dragon called mushu ( eddie murphy ) .  much like the gargoyles in the hunchback of notre dame , the humor in mulan is lukewarm and doesn't flow well with the rest of the more serious story .  sure , some occasional comic relief is welcome , particularly in a film geared for the younger set , but mulan overdoes it .  the overdose of humor turns what could have been a powerfully great film into a good , but schizophrenic experience .  but , that commentary aside , this is a very well made film ( which makes the formulaic additions all the more regrettable ) .  the animation is on par with some of disney's best .  the story itself is interesting , and the action scenes are awe-inspiring .  the musical score to the film is enjoyable , though , as has been the case with disney's recent work , the songs are mostly forgettable .  at least , we're only subjected to four of them this time around .  mulan boasts the highest death toll of any disney cartoon to date .  most of the killing is off-screen and it's all highly depersonalized ( there's nothing to compare with the death of mufasa or bambi's mom ) .  there's nothing graphic , and the film resides snugly inside a g rating .  children will probably have more questions about the restrictive ancient customs than of the slaughter of armies .  it's ironic that a film concerned with bucking tradition is hampered because of its strict adherence to disney tradition .  if the filmmakers had the guts to lessen the humor , ax the compulsory songs , and remove the obligatory ( and somewhat unrealistic ) romance , they could have had a classic on their hands .  instead , they merely deliver a very good time at the movies .

1|"the rich man's wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double , where the story and characters are so one-dimensional and contrived that you know you shouldn't be enjoying yourself .  but somehow , the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things .  not that it's bad , it's just that it's been done before ; and better , in my opinion .  i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre , but it's probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now ; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet , striving helplessly to get out , and instead of just flushing him , you end up kind of rooting for the little guy ?  that's basically how i felt about this movie .  i mean , it's not very good , but it's not completely bad either .  the wife of the title is josie potenza ( played nicely by halle berry ) .  she is married to tony ( christopher mcdonald . . . you  know , the guy who looks like joe piscapo ) , a really stressed-out businessman who drinks way to much and doesn't give josie the attention she deserves ( * cough , cough * ) .  thus , she is driven into the arms of another man , jake golden ( clive owen ) .  near the beginning of the film , josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods .  once there , however , tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details ( i'm still not quite sure what line of work he's in ) .  making the best of her situation , josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars .  one night , she meets a stranger named cole ( peter greene , finally getting a meaty role ) .  they have dinner together , and eventually , both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal .  after learning that she is not happily married , cole offers to "" take care "" of the problem .  managing to escape from the psychotic maniac , josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband .  but then one night , cole shows up . . .  and here is where the fun begins .  from this point on , it's going to be a no-holds- barred cliche-fest , ripping off every movie from strangers on a train to the usual suspects .  this is why most critics panned this movie when it first came out .  and for the most part , they're right ; the rich man's wife has nary one original bone in it's body .  but who cares ?  if you're looking for good ol' dumb suspense movie , you can't do much better than this .  and if you suspense buffs aren't already sold , it has a killer of an ending too .

1|"with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft's square pictures , final fantasy , inspired by the top-selling game franchise , is visually awe-inspiring and groundbreaking .  no doubt , you have never seen anything like this film , and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved .  but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story , wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting ?  obviously , the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi .  everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail : individual threads in the fabric , individual strands of hair swaying , wrinkles and pimples on skin , incredible water effects .  overall , the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue ; and the times when they don't sync perfectly really stand out , since the animation is usually so dazzling .  but you won't spend much time dwelling on those gaffes -- as soon as you catch one , the next stellar monster or effect will have you muttering , "" wow . . . ""  like the series of games , final fantasy's plot and characters have little to do with its predecessors , outside of being born from the same japanese mastermind , hironobu sakaguchi .  it's the year 2065 , and humans are prisoners in caged cities of their own making that guard them from an outside world now overrun with deadly alien "" phantoms . ""  whenever a human comes in contact with the ghostly visitors , the often-invisible beings pass through the body and wrench out its soul ( for some unexplainable reason ) .  while many humans agree with a plan by monomaniacal general hein ( james woods ) to blast the aliens with a "" zeus cannon , "" dr . aki ross ( ming-na ) and dr . sid ( donald sutherland ) plan to build a "" wave "" using eight collected "" spirits "" to counteract the phantoms and kill them off .  while the images serve the sci-fi aspect of the film well , the storytelling doesn't .  it's unfortunate , because the plot seems so intricately thought out .  perhaps it was far too complex and enormous to be entirely incorporated into the script .  some could blame this weakness on the fact that it was a japanese concept translated to english , except two americans wrote the screenplay .  nevertheless , the end result is an elaborate story complicated by confusing holes .  why do these aliens feed on souls ?  if they can pass through bodies and ships , how can humans hurt them with guns ?  what is so special about the "" spirits "" that they would create a force strong enough to destroy the aliens ?  worse yet , the dialogue is scripted to be either like a science-heavy star trek episode , an installment of die hard , or a sappy love story , depending on who's doing the talking .  for the most part , it's bearable considering the genre , but tedious speeches and cheesy lines don't do anything to help the actors and can get annoying in the longer scenes .  the only exception is steve buscemi as pilot neil fleming , who always has great cracks during tense moments .  but , when the lights come up and the credits roll , you're more likely to be remarking on how fantastic the film looked .  there's no question that the roughly 33 million people who have bought at least one final fantasy game will be eager to see this movie , and so should anyone who enjoys being floored by the best cg animation ever put to film .  you'd be living in a fantasy world of your own if you expected much more .

1|"ladies and gentlemen , 1997's independence day is here !  it's title : starship troopers .  and surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 .  i realize that i gave last year's sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour .  after subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn't as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review .  starship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem .  as a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film .  in fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film .  starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether .  while starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : "" the 'star wars' of the 90s . ""  am i being to generous to this film ?  perhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races .  in essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction .  the easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to .  starship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a "" kick-the-aliens'-asses "" style .  id4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role .  this new "" star wars "" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species .  the alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects .  however , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy .  sometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization .  more than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends .  and they should be .  i doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film .  this is an "" event "" film , but surprisingly above average .  it is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) .  starship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange "" join the army "" ads .  mixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original .  stating , "" would you like to know more ? "" ,  these short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously .  however , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way .  after witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw .  we are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) .  rico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms .  however , carmen isn't as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot .  however , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico .  unfortunately , rico isn't interested in dizzy .  this setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch .  carmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up .  and as a result , dizzy signs up .  everyone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry .  the main story follows rico through his trials and relationships .  in reality , i found myself watching a space version of "" melrose place , "" but with better special effects .  an hour into the film , the war begins .  a sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with .  the first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) .  following the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war .  the bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else .  many dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs' attacks .  a sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense .  the troopers are ordered to locate the "" brain "" and capture it .  i hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot .  it's about special effects and gory violence .  director verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall .  verhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood .  starship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year's event horizon .  the r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it .  my guess is that verhoeven's target audience is the 18 to 25 male group .  the film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women .  despite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful .  while watching the film , we never second guess the character's decisions because they seem perfectly clear .  thankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with .  the cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you .  casper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon .  to most guys , he will come across as artificial .  fortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character .  dina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character .  her dizzy is extremely likeable .  denise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done .  jake busey , gary busey's son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film .  neil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast .  however , he does give a good performance .  michael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm .  his performance rises above the rest .  perhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside's presence on screen .  unfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars .  director verhoeven is the main star of the film .  his direction is fast and unrelentless .  he never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride .  writer edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein .  the writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny .  the dialogue is smart but not too smart .  we aren't required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered .  thankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don't ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) .  amazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues .  in fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story .  the moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage .  i haven't laughed this loud , even in some comedies .  oh , and the special effects are first rate .  starship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity .  believe me when i say this : don't take young kids to see this film .  it is extremely violent .  in fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year .  however , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain .  it's been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys .  and still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world .  now that would be entertaining !

1|"billed as a "" feminist sex fantasy "" , this spirited , imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award-winning canadian director cynthia roberts , is destined for extreme reactions .  camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart-felt tale of the title character bubbles galore ( nina hartley ) , a porn-actress-turned-porn-producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence .  however , those in the andrea dworkin camp , will no doubt loathe the film's decidedly pro-porn stance .  political considerations aside , however , this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers ( shauny sexton ) .  in the backdrop , however is bubbles' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky ( tracy wright ) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss .  this femme-butch-femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity * and * sensuality .  in addition to the romantic aspects of the story , bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex-boyfriend godfrey montana ( daniel macivor ) , a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it .  when his plans to sabotage her latest film fall through , he snaps and psychotically decides to kill her .  these proceedings are presided over by a most heavenly presence .  god herself - yes , in the world of this film , god , is most definitely a "" her "" - and a chorus of undulating , scantily-clad angels , have their most watchful and lustful eyes on the events as they unfold , adding a lovely fantasy element to this frothy concoction .  this bright , colourful and deliriously sexy film is chock-full of great performances .  making her dramatic debut , after appearing in over 300 triple x adult films , porn star nina hartley takes command of her role with considerable assurance and a screen presence which puts many other contemporary 'straight' actresses to shame .  hartley has overwhelming star power , and one wonders why other non-triple-x producers haven't used her bountiful talents .  it is also interesting to note that hartley appears in the recent release of "" boogie nights "" , a film which takes a far more traditional doom-and-gloom approach to the porn industry .  making a cameo appearance in the role of god , former porn actress annie sprinkle , a true artist in her own right - gives the entire film an earthy , sensual glow and certainly solidifies and , by her very appearance , downright justifies the themes of the movie .  the other performances are equally solid .  daniel macivor appropriately chews up the scenery as the villainous godfrey and tracy wright lends able support with her complex role .  shauny sexton , an erotic dancer and pin-up model , makes an impressive screen debut .  overall , bubbles galore is a film which wears its politics on its sleeve and very proudly indeed .  at one point , the title character declares that "" instead of trying to save women from the sex trade , we should be working to ensure that the sex trade is a safe place for women to work "" .  the direction by cynthia roberts is daring and subversive .  roberts is not afraid to plunge the otherwise straight-ahead and simple narrative into extended and extremely avant-garde montage sequences .  the love scenes between the women are especially beautiful .  the musical score by nicholas stirling blends cool jazz and lounge stylings , while the skilful cinematography by harald bachmann terrifically captures a blend of garish 70's porn and psychedelia .  amazingly , this film appears to have received a good deal of its funding from a variety of canadian government cultural agencies .  this speaks volumes towards the importance of state funding for culture , as one cannot imagine such an entertaining , original and vital film being made in a traditional setting where conformity and formula rule the day .  bubbles galore seems to be making the film festival rounds and does not , at present , appear to have any traditional distribution in place , so keep your eye on the alternative film listings for this one .  it's funny , sexy and subversive .  and it shouldn't be missed .

1|"seen at the 21st portland international film festival  film title : supermarket woman director : juzo itami country : japan 1997 cinematography : yonezo maeda music : toshiyuki honda cast : nobuko miyamoto , masahitko tsugawa , shiro ito , yuji miyake , akiko matsumoto super features : typical itami film . . .  funny and pointed in its own way .  if you don't care how and what the food you buy goes through in your local supermarket , then this film is not for you . . . .  maybe it is better to ignore it , as this strong and biting satire , as only juzo itami can deliver , will give you an insight as to what some foods go through .  having , in the past , made films that pulled every punch imaginable , from the family traditions ( the funeral ) , to taxes ( a taxing woman & a taxing woman returns ) , to the diabolical gangsters ( minbo ) , to hospitals ( the seriously ill ) , juzo itami , this time takes on the supermarkets' own war , to get the consumers .  and while this film has its funny side , in the crazy situations that it creates , it also shows another side , which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer .  goro has a supermarket .  and a competitor comes into the neighborhood , trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket .  bargains galore , its name , has in mind the closure of goro's humbler venue , so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can .  goro hires hanako , a housewife whose talents seem to be better suited to management , than they are in anything else .  hanako , as she gets familiar with the operation , discovers many of the tricks of the trade , done by many of the elders in charge of each section of the market .  and the procedures , are not always "" fresh "" food , but a new packaging and a new date , to try and convince the customers that quality is on the shelves .  hanako's ideas take hold , starting with a few of the women that work in the supermarket , being that they do not even shop there at all .  and hanako discovers along the way that a few giveaways here and there make a bit of a difference .  if not cause some serious problems in the running of the store .  a price error , forces them to give away eggs for very low prices , and causes the store a few hassles , but , it brought the people in , and everyone knows that these customers will buy a few other things .  as the operation gets stronger , the competition also has trickery up its sleeve , and it has been undermining much of the operation by paybacks to one of the store managers , as well as the meat and fish elder supervisors .  eventually these people are found out , and hanako has to tread slowly and carefully , until in the end they all have a showdown .  and here , the truth and honesty win out , and even one of the elders decides to stay rather than go to work for the corrupt opponent .  in the process , they also find that "" freshness "" ( with some very funny jokes on this word as well ) becomes a much more important tool than they imagined .  with some very nice performances , in this hectic , and fast paced film , this film gives us a sitting of two hours that is satisfying in many ways , although a failed love story between goro and hanako does not come off much , even though towards the end it is suggested .  but this would take away from the satire and its strengths .  with food gags all over the place , the film lets you have it .  and what fun it is .  worth seeing .   ( editorial ) the director of this film , juzo itami , died shortly after the film was finished , and he left behind a legacy of comedy and satire that is rare , and uncompromising .  we would wish that he had been able to make one about film making , of which he must have had a few stories to tell , but we will have to do with much of the japanese society , and its many errant ways . . . .  not to say that these things do not happen anywhere else . . . .  america is no less guilty of any of these subjects at all , should anyone have the guts to tackle it . . .  we could learn something along the way , too . . . .  worth seeing , specially , is a taxing woman and its follow up a taxing woman returns .  the funeral is also good , although not as funny as the later films .  tampopo is also very enjoyable .  all four of these films are available in video , which means your best local site for foreign film may have them . . .  ask for it .

1|i can sum up first strike in one word : awesome .  never in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan .  for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he's ever appeared in , he should be awarded greatly .  the same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chan's rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well .  however , first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three , for the simple reason that practice makes perfect .  his last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great .  like rumble , this film is about the mafia , the former kgb .  now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men .  the trailer for the film sums it up quite well .  first strike is action-packed , but the fight scenes are so fast and furious , they almost have a witty , italian-like humor to them .  jackie chan is a regular comedian .  well , he's no eddie murphy , but he can really crack you up .  for example , he is hanging off a roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him , as he claims to be the korean 007 ( that's secret agent james bond ) .  even the plot to this film improved above the others , as a sort-of twisted nuclear-weapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame .  but never fear , as the chinese mafia aids him in uncovering the truth behind the incident .  with some of the most high-flying stunts and side-splitting comedy , first strike is a sure-fire hit that's guaranteed to draw some major , world-wide attention .   ,  |0.8336666666666668|0.9333333333333332|0.9499999999999998|"The movie ""First Strike"" is highly praised for its positive aspects, including Jackie Chan's dedication and performance, action-packed and entertaining fight scenes, side-splitting comedy, and an improved plot compared to previous films, all contributing to a strong positive sentiment."
