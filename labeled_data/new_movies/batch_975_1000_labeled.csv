1|"martin scorsese's films used to intimidate me .  because of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks .  as much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something .  i learned from scorsese's casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story .  no mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies .  for example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other .  there was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on .  or toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building .  again , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing .  i don't mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking .  but he simply uses the best tool for the job .  it shouldn't have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward .  the movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet .  the movie's title is another name for the dalai lama which means "" ocean of wisdom . ""  his story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story .   ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film's opening shot and watch where it is repeated . )  we first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old .  his curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama .  a test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before .  several items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items .  the child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own .  the boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama .  scorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk .  before selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation .  sometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice .  either way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader .  >from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama's spirit and the future leader of a nation .  it is a great weight to put on the mind of a child .  in the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services .  but the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage .  neither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person .  certain patterns take shape over the years .  for example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology .  radios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys .  when he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet .  he also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals .  it's nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter .  but the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet's gigantic neighbor , china .  tibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border .  the chinese invasion is so successful that the lama's life is in danger if he stays .  the movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india .  the story doesn't lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do .  it just doesn't fit that mold .  if it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) .  the pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that .  the structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa .  perhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet .  a mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie .  the robes and hats of state are bright red and gold .  the bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans .  even the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet .  philip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice .  for those who don't know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala .  his building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns .  these patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition .  people won't be flocking to kundun for it's great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music .  it gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person .  on top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look .

1|"robert redford's a river runs through it is not a film i watch often .  it is a masterpiece -- one of the better films of recent years .  until 1994 , it was my second favorite film of all time .  the acting and direction is top-notch -- never sappy , always touching .  a friend of mine once reported that he avoided it because "" i was afraid it would just be really politically correct , and tick me off .

1|"richard gere is not one of my favorite actors .  however , i like courtroom dramas , and this film looked good enough to take a chance on .  i wasn't disappointed .  it wasn't a great film , but it was interesting , and took several unexpected turns .  one thing : what's with the title ?  not only is it extremely forgettable , it doesn't really have much to do with the film , as far as i could determine .  in the long run , it will probably hurt the film , as people won't be able to think of or remember it .  martin vail ( richard gere ) is a grandiose defense attorney .  he loves the money and the fame that go along with defending ( successfully ) rich scum , such as mafia men and drug-dealers .  once he sees that the accused killer of a prominent chicago archbishop is a baby-faced alter boy , he wants in on the case , presumably for the press he'll get .  we soon find out that the prosecutor assigned is a former lover , janet venable ( laura linney ) .  vail himself is a former prosecutor , and quit because of tensions between himself and the district attorney , played very well by john mahoney ( frasier's father on the tv series ) .  there is an underlying theme of dichotomy in the movie : people have public faces , and private faces .  we see this in the murdered archbishop , in the accused , and , most strongly , defense attorney martin vail .  richard gere does a fairly good job .  at first , he appears to be a money- and attention-grabbing lawyer , with no consideration of the truth .  but we see another side , as he becomes a seeker of justice , and comes to believe in his client .  alfre woodard , as the judge , is capable , though somewhat wasted in a standard role .  laura linney also does journeyman work ; nothing spectacular , but acceptable .  her relationship with vail is believable ; their verbal fencing adds to the film .  the actor who playes vail's investigator ( unfortunately , i don't remember his name ) is quite good .  his female assistant ( she looked very familiar , but i can't remember where i've seen her ) was also capable , but unspectacular .  the best performance in the film was by edward norton .  he was excellent , as the timid altar-boy turned alleged "" butcher boy of st . mike's "" .  i was impressed by the depth of the plot ; there are red-herrings , and dead-ends , that in a lesser film would lead to a predictable ending .  i liked the plot twists the film took , and most of the supporting characters , thus i give primal fear a respectable b+ rating .

1|" "" when you get out of jail , you can kill him . ""  starring ashley judd , tommy lee jones , bruce greenwood .  rated r .  double jeopardy is a lurid , prepostrous thriller that's also one of the year's most enjoyable .  it's an uncompromisingly brutal , cheerfully anarchic , hyperactive actioner that has a mission and never diverts from it .  there is not a moment here when the events on screen don't have a direct bearing on the plot ; once the film gets going it never stops .  it has been branded as the female version of the fugitive and that's probably a correct assessment of the plot , but the film itself has little in common with the 1993 andrew davis/harrison ford collaboration besides the presence of star tommy lee jones .  not even bothering with character introduction , director bruce beresford floors the gas pedal from the get-go and never finds the brake .  we meet , rather hastily , libby and nick parsons ( ashley judd and bruce greenwood , respectively ) a seemingly happy married couple , with a son matty , age 4 . they go out on a sailboat one night , and after a period of some rockin' sex , they go to sleep .  libby hears a strange noise , wakes up and discovers that she is covered with blood .  she follows a red trail to the upper deck , where she finds a knife and , out of astonishment , picks it up .  at that convenient moment , the coast guard shows up and libby is arrested .  her lawyer , a friend , puts up a defense in court , but though we know she is innocent , the evidence against her is too compelling .  her friend adopts her son and she goes to prison .  once in prison , she makes a phone call to her friend .  her friend gives her son the phone .  nick walks in the room .  little matty screams "" daddy ! ""  the phone goes dead .  libby realizes that the man she is imprisoned for killing isn't even dead .  she gets some advice from a prisoner/former lawyer , who tells her that since the state already convicted her of killing her husband , they can't convict her of the same crime again , meaning that when she gets paroled she can kill him and they can't touch her .  after a weirdly short amount of time , she gets out of parole .  she is sent to live at a house with other recent parolees , under the command of parole officer travis lehman ( tommy lee jones ) .  she sets out on a mission to find her husband and get her son back , which turns out to be much more difficult than anticipated .  she winds up tracking him all the way to new orleans where she finds out that he has long killed his girlfriend and her son's "" adopter "" .  double jeopardy is based on an assumption that is legally false .  the law stating that nobody can be convicted twice for the same crime assumes that it is the same crime : same time , same place , same circumstances .  it's not like it matters .  this is a rollickingly good thriller ; intense , exciting , fast and furious .  it's silly alright , but this is the kind of film you just don't question .  in some films , plausibility is everything .  double jeopardy , however , is not concerned with making sense : its sole purpose is to entertain , and it does .  judd helps the film tremendously in a difficult role .  this is her breakout box-office performance , and she is terrific .  she brings some emotion to what could have been a one-dimensional role , giving the movie a little soul to go along with its effective chase scenes and action set pieces .  tommy lee jones basically just reprises the role for which he won an oscar in the fugitive , but the movie makes good use of his stone-faced wit .  thankfully , too , double jeopardy refrains from developing a romance between libby and travis ; a subplot which doubtlessly would have interfered with the film's story .  this is one of those movies where cops are the bad guys , and i took a sort of sick pleasure in that .  the sheer anarchy of the proceedings was nothing short of wonderful , as ashley judd kicks the crap out of every authority figure in the book .  after all the idealistic hollywood features featuring hero cops , deft fbi agents and the virtues of the american legal system , it's great to see a movie that doesn't so much demonstrate their fallacy as it delights in their failure .  double jeopardy is really good , but it isn't the kind of good that is remembered or recognized with awards .  it's one of those movies better viewed with the brain turned off , otherwise , your brain will be busy ruining your experience .  this is a thriller that isn't concerned with being smart or plausible .  instead it diverts all attention to the action , which , this year , is second to none .

1|"let's say you live at the end of an airport runway .  large jetliners continuously pass over your house , rattling your windows and allowing few moments of peace .  let's say the ground beneath your feet is also contaminated with toxic substances , and high voltage power lines run across steel towers only yards from your home .  now let's say an airport conglomerate wants to buy your property in order to lengthen the runway , and offers you more than it's worth .  wouldn't you jump in the air and have your bags packed before you landed ?  of course you would .  but what if this bit of land was your idea of paradise , and the house your castle ?  that's what they are to darryl kerrigan ( michael caton ) , and although he's happy that a multi-national corporation would like to buy his home , sorry , it's not for sale .  unfortunately , the corporation wields quite a bit of influence over the australian government , which serves darryl and his family with what amounts to an eviction notice .  not about to take this lying down , darryl enlists the help of his inept attorney friend dennis denuto ( tiriel mora ) and makes a determined , albeit pathetic , attempt to fight back .  the castle , an australian comedy by rob sitch , is perhaps one of the simplest movies i've seen in recent memory , yet also one of the funniest .  in fact , it is this film's reliance on simplicity which makes it so successful .  the good guys and the bad guys are clear , the humor is straightforward , and the storyline is as uncomplicated as it gets .  it's the perfect setup for a relaxing , hilarious good time , and as much as i hate to admit it , i liked the fact that i didn't have to think all that much while watching this film .  i just sat back and enjoyed myself .  the situation is one we've seen before : regular joe fights back against the government , or big business , or whatever .  what makes this film different is its characters .  darryl thinks he's got the best life in the world - he tells his family that living next to power lines is a constant reminder of the success of mankind , he asks who would ever want to go out and eat in a fancy restaurant when he's got the meat loaf feast prepared by his wife sal ( anne tenny ) , and he swells with pride when his son dale ( stephen curry ) digs a hole in the yard .  steve kerrigan ( anthony simcoe ) constantly combs the buy and sell ads looking for "" investments "" like jousting sticks and overhead projectors , while wayne kerrigan is in jail , as a result of dennis denuto's incompetent courtroom maneuvers .  the great thing about the kerrigans is that they aren't so stupid that they get annoying .  they're just a group of simpletons whose naive nature is perfectly harmless and even endearing .  we look upon them with a little bit of pity , but a whole lot of affection .  screenwriters sitch , santo cilauro , tom gleisner , and jane kennedy pit this lovable bunch of unlikely crusaders against a stoic court system and a condescending business conglomerate , further polarizing the extremes and deepening our feelings for the kerrigans .  sympathy for their situation , the laughter they bring us , and the family's wonderful characterization , simple as it may be , leaves us with a degree of emotional investment that causes us to actually care about what happens to them .  i suppose one might wonder how deep characterization can go when your characters are as inane as the kerrigans , but trust me , it works .  i particularly noted that the writers did not have to use slapstick in order to get laughs .  don't get me wrong - slapstick , when executed well , can be genius .  it's just that too often , a film will resort to it's use as a shortcut to amusing the audience , not always successfully .  instead , the jokes in the castle are all hinged upon the dialog uttered by these people who have no idea that they are totally skewed to the rest of the world .  when they are by themselves , the are funny , and when they are with normal people , they are hilarious .  one of the few problems i saw with this film was a detour taken about midway though .  the kerrigans go out to a vacation spot for seemingly no reason other than to pack in a few more jokes and increase the film's running time .  luckily , it's a funny little detour that , while slightly distracting from the film's main drive , is still quite enjoyable .  with all the levity abound in the castle , the film still manages to take on a pretty heavy concept , that of the innate right of a citizen to keep his property , an issue which has been bandied about in courts across the civilized world with differing outcomes .  i'm not certain the courtroom monologue near the end of the film would actually hold up in real life , but it brings to the forefront the essence of the constitution ( of australia ) and certainly sounds impressive at any rate .  and , for that matter , it's more than i would have expected out of a light hearted film like this .

1|" "" no man is an island , "" one character quotes john donne in apt pupil , effectively summarizing the movie's themes .  while hardly a great film , singer's ambitious adaptation of king's short story * is challenging nonetheless ; perhaps the most shocking aspect of this inclement psychological thriller is that a major studio got behind it .  apt pupil is a bleak picture destined to be misunderstood by the masses .  1984 . wonder-bred high school honours student todd bowden ( renfro ) conducts his own extracurricular investigation of kurt dussander , a nazi war criminal who fearfully fled berlin in the 1960s and was never heard from again .  bowden suspects arthur denker ( mckellan ) , the lonely german senior citizen who lives nearby , is actually a pseudonymous dussander-much research and dusting for fingerprints proves young todd's theory .  bowden strikes a deal with dussander : in exchange for not revealing his identity , dussander must satisfy bowden's intense curiosity by recounting the atrocities of the holocaust from the nazi point of view .  the stories he hears keep todd up at night and haunt his daydreams , but like a bystander at a traffic accident , todd's desire for gory details overrides his repulsion .  bowden revives in dussander feelings dormant since the end of wwii .  marching in a mock uniform around his kitchen is wholly cathartic for dussander : it leads to his torture of a cat and the torment of his "" student "" , among other things .  bowden , who has taken on very hateful qualities ( he kills birds and doodles swastikas on his notebook ) , engages the veteran in an endless game of one-upmanship .  dussander stands to lose his freedom , and bowden his credibility-in effect , his post-secondary school future .  all of this winds down to a fairly unpredictable ( and unsettling ) conclusion , one which requires leaps of faith from its audience yet is more satisfying than the source material's excessive climax .  singer has yet to get keyser s ? ze out of his system .  his the usual suspects and apt pupil are both about evil masquerading as innocence ( verbal's tics and todd's golden-boy reputation are plausible ruses ) ; they showcase morally bankrupt anti-heroes to whom telling the truth is not an option if they are to achieve their goals .  apt pupil is a richer film than the usual suspects , a movie famous and popular partly because its plot machinations were not germane to the outcome-there was no way you could see the ending coming , as it was all a hoodwink , anyway .  thankfully , singer has gotten most of the usual suspects' film-schoolish geek theatrics out of his system .  some scenes in apt pupil feel overdirected and/or obvious ( the dream sequences were extraneous ) , but the majority of the film is subdued-and singer's handling of the violent scenes is boldly restrained for a film about a murderer and a murderer-in-training .  mckellan's and renfro's performances contribute enormously to the overall success of the film ; while most people will focus on british stage vet mckellan's finely-tuned realization , i'd like to single out renfro's daring work .  he isn't afraid to play someone largely unappealing and cold-hearted ; he strips his character of vanity , something many of his peers wouldn't do .   ( can you picture kieran culkin or jonathan taylor-thomas in the same role ? )  renfro was recently charged with possession of cocaine-i hope he doesn't continue down that path , because he has a big future in good movies waiting for him .  as guidance counsellor edward french , "" friend "" schwimmer also deserves mention .  he wants to be the parent to todd that todd's own well-to-do folks are not ( todd , like most modern kids-and only-children-has mom and dad wrapped around his pinky finger ) , and his sincerity makes the apt pupil's blackening-heart even more apparent .  but one of the film's ultimate questions , are we born evil or do we learn evil ? , might be answered in french , whose motives are the slightest bit ambiguous .  no man is an island , indeed-we all have the capacity to make the "" right "" or the "" wrong "" choices .  schwimmer winningly plays one of a trio of fascinating characters who make the unconventional apt pupil laudible .  -october , 1998   * the excellent collection king's stories called different seasons spawned not only apt pupil , but the shawshank redemption ( originally titled rita hayworth and the shawshank redemption ) and stand by me ( originally titled the body ) .

1|"i rented this movie with very high hopes .  this movie got praise as one of the best films of 1998 , and unfortunately , was not as good as i hoped , but was still very intriguing and thought provoking .  first of all , the casting for this film is great .  tobey maguire and reese witherspoon are the future of hollywood .  they play their roles as the parker brother and sister perfectly .  with a plot as unbelievable as this film , you need chemistry and honest acting from your cast .  tobey and reese ( bud and mary sue parker ) play their roles perfectly and display their characters with honesty and believability .  william h . macy , an actor i have grown to love over the past year , turns in another great performance as the tv dad who is torn over his wife , a "" colored "" person and his friends , the "" non-colored "" ones .  he also displays believability and must display a certain lack of chemistry with his wife .  he does this perfectly and yet again shows why he should be one of the top actors in hollywood .  joan allen is equally great as betty parker , the ideal tv mom .  her character is the most ambitious .  she is very na ? ve , and must display this well to make her character believable and she does just that .  her lack of chemistry with macy , which the role calls for , and her developed chemistry with jeff daniels is terrific , and if daniels would have been as stellar as the rest of the cast , then this film would even been even better .  as said before , jeff daniels gives a bad performance .  his character displays the change going on throughout the town , yet he does not display it with enough conviction .  his character is very confusing and he is not very believable .  this film could have been elevated to a whole new level had daniels been able to give a better performance .  the movie is very provocative .  it challenges the issues of racism that existed in the past and that still exist today .  i really was not expecting all of the elements they brought up , but they pulled them off with such flair that it was mind blowing .  they demonstrate the racism issue without a hitch , but do it in a slow pace .  the only major flaw in the film besides the performance by daniels is length .  some films are not meant to be that long .  pleasantville is one of those films .  this film could have been so much better had they not moved so slowly to it .  first , they are amazed by the implementation of color .  then they want to have it .  then they do not want to .  then the war ensues between the colored and non-colored .  this is all strung out over two hours , which was way too long .  some movies need a lot of time .  saving private ryan was a little bit under three hours long and i thought it could have used more time .  this film is only two hours long , and seems much longer .  length is everything in films .  if you can nail down the perfect timing and pace , you can win half the battle .  pleasantville can move at a good pace at times , but it is not consistent enough .  overall , pleasantville is a very pleasant and provocative departure from the predictability of most films these days .  i went in expecting a light-hearted film about change .  i left learning an important lesson about racism and the way things change .  luckily , pleasantville teaches this lesson in such a way to make it appeal to all audiences .  only if it could have done in a shorter amount of time .

1|"few films in 1999 have divided the critical consensus as sharply as alan parker's adaptation of frank mccourt's memoir angela's ashes .  many dismissed it as an humorless , sentimentalized , uninteresting version of the hugely popular novel ; others hailed it as a heartfelt , sincere portrait of the human spirit .  i'm somewhere in between , leaning strongly towards the latter .  it's certainly well-made and it never becomes tedious like some literary adaptations have a tendency to be .  but i have a feeling that parker filled the movie with pseudo-lyrical shots of rain falling on the homely streets of ireland just so it can have the two-and-a-half hour running time that screams "" i'm important ! ""  mccourt's book of the same name was about him and his family moving from the us to ireland in the early 1900's , a time when most people were desperately trying to get into the us .  as he comments , "" we were the only irishfolk to say goodbye to the statue of liberty . ""  in ireland , frank ( played by joe breen as a small child ) , his 3 brothers , his mother angela ( emily watson ) and his father malachy ( robert carlyle ) get financial help from angela's mother , a stereotypically strict catholic who chides her daughter for marrying a northern irishman .  she helps them get a rat-infested apartment and malachy goes looking for a job .  positions are scarce and when he does finally find one , he is unable to hold on to it because of his fondness for drinking .  meanwhile , frank goes to an uptight catholic school , where the instructors beat students with blunt wooden objects as often as their heart desires .  two of frank's brothers soon die , crippled by the dreadful living conditions and malnutrition .  as if the poverty and the suffering weren't intense enough as it stood , malachy and angela have another baby , worsening the situation further .  i imagine this doesn't sound like much of a plot .  that's probably because it isn't one .  these are people .  this is their story .  director alan parker ( the commitments ) knows how to tell a good story and angela's ashes , despite its relentlessly literary tone remains interesting .  though the film occasionally indulges too much in its gloomily picturesque irish setting , it avoids looking like a glorified travelogue .  supplementing parker's able direction are the engaging , often poignant performances of the leads , some of them seasoned thespians , others relative beginners .  carlyle , the charismatic british actor who has shown astonishing range by hopping from the lead in a rowdy slapstick comedy to the villain in a james bond movie and now to sentimental melodrama , perfectly portrays his rather pathetic character .  we empathize with the guy , but we don't like or admire him .  emily watson turns in a heartfelt , sincere supporting performance .  it is mostly she who implants that lump in our throats .  also worthy of mention is little joe breen , whose face graces the film's superb poster .  it is breen's first feature film and he's extraordinary as young frank .  not unlike sudden oscar darling haley joel osment of the sixth sense , you can peer into the character's soul through breen's sad eyes .  on the flip side , one thing that could have vastly improved angela's ashes is a more decisive editor .  while gerry hambling sure makes the most of the scenery , he and parker also leave in at least a half an hour of unnecessary footage .  the first half , especially , could have been trimmed down , bringing the film to a more reasonable running time and doing our bladders a favor in the process .  things pick up at about the halfway point , sort of dismissing a lot of the criticisms i accumulated during the opening hour , but i maintain that the aggressively deliberate pace parker and co . set in the first half was ludicrously unnecessary .   * spoiler warning !  skip next paragraph if in suspense ! *  the film's final message is somewhat conflicted , as frankie , in effect , leaves his family famished in ireland while he himself goes back to america .  what , exactly , are we supposed to make of that ?  his mother doesn't seem to mind because she wants the best possible future for her son , as any mother would , but it still seems inconsiderate of him .  i haven't read the book , but i'm sure that mccourt justifies his actions therein ; therefore , i'm suspicious .  another thing that's never made clear in the movie is the meaning of the title , which , i'm sure , is also explained in the memoir .  if seen as a film onto itself , rather than an adaptation , angela's ashes stands tall .  despite a few minor setbacks , it is a captivating story of people forced to live in the trenches by an merciless society where those of weaker character are shoved to the bottom of the financial ladder .

1|"now that "" boogie nights "" has made disco respectable again ( well , fashionable at least ) , we shouldn't be surprised to see more films glorifying that dubious era .  the latest art house interpretation is whit stillman's "" the last days of disco . ""  stillman , who made "" metropolitan "" and "" barcelona "" using some of the same actors , uses disco's final hours to highlight what is another conversation-heavy movie that benefits from typically astute writing from the director .  the young , upwardly-mobile professional ( don't call them yuppies ! )  men and women of "" the last days of disco "" frequent a prestigious new york city nightclub pulsating to the bass-pounding rhythms of earth wind and fire , amy grant , and andrea true connection .  here they talk and talk and talk , intellectualizing about such things as dating , success , and being liked , accepted , and admired .  if talk is cheap , "" the last days of disco "" must surely have been an extremely inexpensive movie to shoot .  what makes the film so entertaining is that this preppie , harvard-educated jet set actually have something to say and say it with wit , perception , and style ( including , at one point , a riotously inventive deconstruction of "" the lady and the tramp "" ) .  na ? ve alice ( chlo ? sevigny ) and sophisticated charlotte ( kate beckinsale ) are recent college graduates who work as assistant editors for a new york publishing house .  charlotte is confident and outspoken--perhaps a little too outspoken ; alice is shy and introverted , "" like a kindergarten teacher . ""  the two friends often doll themselves up and head out to the nameless nightspot , looking good and looking for excitement ( and that ms . beckinsale sure looks good on a dancefloor ! ) .  here they meet , or re-meet , a variety of eligible men , many of whom they knew in college .  des ( played by stillman favorite christopher eigeman ) is one of the club's managers whose job is on the line for sneaking his ad agency buddies in the back .  des has reached a crisis point in his life : he just found out--last wednesday , in fact--that he's gay .  whether it's true or not , it makes for a convenient excuse to dump his latest girlfriend ( jennifer beals in a small but soul-baring turn ) .  charlotte observes cattily that the only gay thing about des is his mouth .  jimmy ( mackenzie astin ) is the advertising exec who , by the end of the picture , winds up heading for a new job opportunity in spain ( visions of "" barcelona "" ? ) .  josh ( matt keeslar ) is an assistant district attorney who dreams of being able to say , just once , "" book this clown ! ""  and robert sean leonard plays another one of alice's revolving suitors ; the two have an amusing exchange about the true definition of virginity .  any film that can make robert sean leonard palatable is worthy of respect in my book .  in fact , the entire ensemble is appealing in that well-spoken stillman way .  while the eschewing of "" ferocious pairing "" is a favored topic of conversation in the film , the protagonists tend to slip in and out of love , lust , and trouble with each other in an emotional merry-go-round that cleverly develops its characters through the "" preferred "" dynamics of social group interaction .  more mature than stillman's previous two films , "" the last days of disco "" is as consistently droll as it is stimulating .  it's a movie you should definitely get on down to .

1|"i think the first thing this reviewer should mention is wether or not i am a fan of the x-files .  first , let me assure you that no prior experience with the series is required to fully enjoy this movie .  the producers are not stupid , making a movie just for fans of the series is not profitable .  you have to reach for a larger audience .  therefore , the movie is quite user-friendly .  altough , non-fans will only fail to understand certain emotions behind the looks many characters exchange .  but fear not , duchovny and another man later on provide more than adequate background info on what is going on .  you will never feel as if you just walked in on the third act of some great opera .  in any case , the answer is no .  i am not a fan of the x-files , i only watch it when nothing else is on and i prefer millennium .  however , since the fox network as been so kind as to air several key episodes for several weeks before the movie's opening weekend i took that opportunity to test the movie .  i taped all of these episodes and watched them only after seing the movie , i am glad to report that i learned nothing new .  everything you need to know is explained to the viewer by duchovny and others .  i know i am going maybe a bit too far to make my point but everybody should get the chance to experience this movie .  warning : major spoilers follow !  please do not read to fully enjoy this movie , you must not be able know what is coming , what exactly is over that hill and what that weird "" hummm "" sound is all about .  you have been warned .  the x-files is what a summer should be .  exciting , scary , great special effects ( unlike other summer movies the effects do not take over the movie and are only there when it is really necessary ) and good performances .  this is coming from a guy who thinks david duchovny is the human equivalent of a wooden plank .  from start to finish , this movie does not let go of you .  when i compare it with last summer's movies the best way to describe it would be : take the excitement and great score from face/off and the deadly use of sound from event horizon .  this flick is scary , not in a b movie kind of way where you always know where and when the critter will jump at our heroes .  in fact , the first time the critter in this movie makes an apperance it is totally out of the blue .  you might as well bring ear plugs because this thing is louuuudd !  the last time a monster scared me that much was when i first saw aliens as a six year old kid .  you know , when you are affraid to put your feet on the floor because the creature might be under the chair , or when you keep trying to cover your throat with your shirt ?  so yeah , the x-files is scary .  and guess what ?  you never even have to see the monster but your imagination works overtime and it sure beats having to watch a flawed , computer generated , babyzilla , it looks like you could walk right through it not even scarier than your grandma in undies type of monster .  do not think that the x-files is a monster movie .  in fact , the creature is there for maybe three minutes total .  no , the x-files is definately a mulder episode of the series .  scully is at his side , of course , but gillian anderson gets maybe half the screen time .  she has a couple of good scenes with duchovny , but she gets kidnapped during the last half hour of the movie so she does not get to do much .  no , this is mulder's time in the spotlight .  by now , you have heard of the scene where mulder "" showers "" independence day .  if you have not then i will not spoil it for you , let's just say that due to recent events mulder should be "" showering "" godzilla instead .  to those of you wondering if mulder discovers that the truth is indeed out there . . . who  cares ! ?  if he did find it the series would over anyway so what are you complaining about ?  the dialogue in interesting and the director is marvelous .  the camera is almost always looking over the shoulder of our heroes so we feel as if we are right there with them when they open a door or climb a hill .  the script is spotless , every thing that happens happens for a purpose .  if you are confused by something , do not worry because it will all become clear later on but , and i cannot stress this enough , pay attention ! ! !  unlike most summer movies , the dialogue is twice as important as the effects .  miss one vital piece of information and , like most people who talk during movies , you will go home and tell all your friends how this movie made no sense .  also , to those people who need to go to the bathroom during movies . . . don't !  the person who watched the movie with me had to go twice and twice she missed an important conversation .  there is no time to take a breather between scenes because , again unlike most summer movies ( godzilla anybody ?   ) the x-files does not need to fill scenes between the suspense and the action with useless subplots , every scene is crucial and serves a purpose .  who needs to see the blond chiouaoua have a "" big emotional scene "" between godzilla attacks ?  so far this summer i have seen only one movie who ranks higher on my list of movies i'd recommend and that is the truman show but it only wins by a nose .  but the truman show is not what i would call a summer movie , the x-files is .  what more do you ask from a summer movie other than the chance to be excited ?  cool effects ?  it's got some .  pulse pounding ?  hell yes !  strangely enough , i think that fans of the series will hate this movie while non-fans will have a good time .  it does not provide answers to the show's many questions , the status quo remains nearly the same and , no , mulder and scully do not get together .  rating : four and a half out of five stars for the best movie yet this summer , several jump right out of your seat thrills , many "" whoah , i never saw that one coming ! ""  moments , four "" holy shit , where the hell did that come from "" and one heck of an ending .  you may wonder where this movie lost half a star .  well , i swore never to give a movie the full five stars so i had to find something about the in his ice truck , the tracks it leaves in the snow behind him go on for several miles but then they just stop .  it's pretty obvious the film's makers drove the truck for several miles to give the appearance that mulder had been driving for a long time , but in the end it looks like mulder just dropped from the sky and started driving .

1|"i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn't .  george lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again .  this is the first star wars film i've seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video .  what is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals .  basically , the film's plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets .  qui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war .  when their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother .  qui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing .  anakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon's ship .  however , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy .  meanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit's end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders .  there are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb .  this does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made .  in all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes .  despite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws .  for starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience .  what a klutz !  george lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain .  secondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie's atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments .  this is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie's plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here .  the movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions .  i can't say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway .  however , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale .  natalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma .  there is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance .  jake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk .  despite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie .  the heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn't quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite .  the film is a treasure to look at .  the visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius .  not since 1997's the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one .  the production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick's 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang's classic silent metropolis .  however , all the sets are so original .  the original star wars movies can't even match the grandeur of this film's visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode .  the costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them .  whether its queen amadala's gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness .  the costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie .  as for john williams' score , i don't think he's done one as complex or powerful since ? i can't even remember .  it is as epic as his schindler's list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws .  it includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving .  what with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed .  there is very little to hate in the film : it's a very accomplished and skillfully made flick .  it is the best "" fun "" film and the best big-budget film out today , most definitely .

tell the truth it doesn't much matter .  there could be almost any plot and the film would be just as entertaining .  the narrative only exists so we can watch the offbeat characters and the quirky predicaments they fall into .  the dude's bowling buddies walter ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) look like people you'd see on the street but , like everything else in this film , they're not quite what they seem .  walter is a vet as stuck in vietnam as the dude is in the sixties .  everything that happens reminds him of a situation in the nam .  when a fellow bowler crosses the foul line but won't admit it , walter pulls a gun on him until he marks a zero on the score sheet .  donny gets precious few words in between walter's screaming and the dude's rambling .  when he does , walter shouts him down with horrendous albeit seemingly unintentional bowling puns .  donny is "" out of his league "" and doesn't "" have a frame of reference "" .  the film is peppered with people for whom the term "" character "" would be an understatement .  the big lebowski's daughter maude , an avant-garde "" vaginal "" artist , paints while swinging naked in a leather apparatus like an s&m mary martin .  the kidnappers are german techno nihilist bikers .  bunny lebowski is a high school cheerleader turned porno star .  most impressive is john turturro in his far too small role as a hispanic bowler .  as the flamenco music swells , we see him putting on his lavender hose .  the camera pans up to an all-purple skin-tight bowling outfit with "" jesus "" ( pronounced with a "" j "" , not an "" h "" ) embroidered on the pocket .  he addresses the lane with intense seriousness and one painted fingernail .  his tongue slowly snakes out and lovingly licks the glowing bowling ball .  bridges works the dude as if he had been living him for decades and maybe he has .  i can't think of anyone else who could have done a better job .  buscemi has a limited role , but he plays it perfectly .  the more that i see john goodman the more convinced i am that he's one of the treasures of our time .  it's odd to think that most of the world knows him only as roseanne barr's television husband .  more like the coen's "" raising arizona "" than their hit "" fargo "" , "" the big lebowski "" demands an open mind and even more open eyes .  a mark of the coen brothers is that even with all wonderful dream sequences and the broad slapstick physical comedy on the screen , much of the humor is subtle and easy to miss .  there's so much going on that frequently it disappears before you can see it .  walking out of the theater , i felt that the film had something important to say .  on further examination , i wasn't sure exactly what it was .   "" if you meet jesus at the bowling alley , it's not going to be what you expect "" ?   "" when the going gets weird , the weird go bowling "" ?  maybe there's no real message .  perhaps it's just a roller coaster ride through a hilarious world .  maybe that's enough .

1|i don't box with kid gloves .  i don't play nice , i'm not a nice guy , and i never , ever , go easy on a film .  i consider it to be a breech of some sort of code of ethics for a movie critic .  however , i do some favors , and these often come in the form of points that i hand to certain groups due to the artistic bravery .  rigormortis , the production company that has been my prime example of how money does not need to motivate filmmaking , gets several of these points each time .  i still , however , will not go easy on them .  they recently sent me a vhs copy of their down with america trilogy ( which begins , quite wittily , with a disclaimer that they are not trying to undermine america with the making of this film . ) and i decided to spend an hour of my day watching it .  in the famous lines of many martyrs , i have no regrets .  well , i do have some regrets , but that is not the point in the previous sentence .  the point of it was that down with america was a film that , from a critical standpoint , did not entirely disappoint me .  sure , the risky use of vhs instead of super 8mm or 16mm was a pain , and the natural light was one of the most annoying things about public access films , but the movie itself was fairly enjoyable .  down with america concerns a government agent , needless murder , and a book containing everything from the unabomber's manifesto to the 1995 apple computer profit report .  like the previous films of rigormortis that i have reviewed , it displays an off-kilter humor and intelligence ? it succeeds in making me laugh where countless studio films fail .  the best way to see this film would be as a parody of the countless conspiracy films that we have been drowned in since the paranoia of the 80s .  a dying movement from the day they started , these paranoid `thrillers' had the government always covering up something and had the same favorite word : `roswell . '  in down with america , the line `roswell' is highly absent .  with an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters .  again , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn't care less about .  the film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) .  the plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all .  from there we go into a delightful parody .  the federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books .  we spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast .  although the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out .  for once , i don't have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online .  i can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself .  it's almost as much fun as the film .  |-0.16666666666666663|0.8666666666666667|0.85|"The text presents a mixed sentiment towards the film ""Down with America.""

1|"here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop .  okay , it isn't quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart .  most films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them .  however , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered .  a lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash .  but , the thing is , it isn't .  it's well made , well acted , and quite intelligent .  i can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film .  but the species series isn't about the lack of these elements .  it's about how much it can get into one film .  and yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so .  species ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe .  many films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film's needs .  species ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars .  aboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut .  patrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed .  well , it would seem that he has succeeded .  landing on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so .  of course , he isn't the first ever .  about a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life .  now , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky .  no life lives on it .  that is , no visible life .  patrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground .  he takes them aboard , and puts them in storage .  unfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship .  just prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings .  they pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can't even remember .  they blame it on a technical malfunction .  back on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible .  as we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet .  however , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is .  patrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) .  eve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien .  however , this time around , most of her "" alien "" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant .  the project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable .  since she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again .  and it has .  story-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can't tell me it was strong on story ) .  what surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay .  in my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles .  this piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) .  the script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot .  beginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie .  and it does it quite well .  the characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do .  the only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does .  there are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects .  the special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad .  but for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) .  also , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone's head being blown off .  however , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary .  many people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence .  however , i tend to disagree .  what were the alien films about ?  and , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn't you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ?  my only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store .  i didn't realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) .  the acting is quite good for this kind of film .  it is a vast improvement over the first film , at least .  the acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens .  okay , so it isn't that good .  george dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting .  natasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage .  however , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent .  oh yeah , and she's quite fun to just plain watch .  marg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film .  michael madsen is so-so , but he isn't annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) .  james cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor .  as i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability .  mykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel .  and , of course , justin lazard .  lazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective .  sure , he is wooden , but isn't that what his character is like ?  the moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple's acting .  species ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language .  this is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see .  more than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives .  hell , i don't even know if i will .  what is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year .  i probably won't see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while .  director peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series .  medak has also mastered the wonderful "" jump ! ""  moments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) .  strong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining .

1|"plot : this movie takes place over one day .  it's a rookie cop's narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran .  the rookie doesn't know much about "" street justice "" , so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the "" real world "" .  how even cops like themselves have to "" bend the rules "" and "" break the law "" every now and then , in order to catch the really bad guys .  critique : a pretty intense little movie with solid acting across the board , some ups , some downs and a thrilling ending , despite a couple of small flaws .  i really enjoyed this movie because it followed two extreme characters and put them in situations which had me wondering about what i would do if i were in their place .  the film gets right into the "" dirty "" side of , well . . . the  dirt on the streets , and proceeds to teach the rookie cop ( and us , the audience ) how things really work down there .  of course , we're receiving this lesson from a man who has put away a lot of scum in his time , but the things he seems to be doing aren't exactly on the up-and-up either .  and therein , lies the fun of the film .  do you agree that you yourself would need to break a few small laws in order to put away the people who break the really big ones ?  well , as the film moves along , we're given two points of view in respect to this predicament , and to me , both sides made sense at some point or another .  and you gotta give a lot of credit to the screenplay for that , the director , who builds the film up wonderfully ( with the darkness of the day leading to the darkness in the script ) and the two actors who deliver their parts in spades .  hawke , first off , because he rarely plays these "" commercial "" roles but does so perfectly here , with a vulnerable side which has you feeling for the bastard right off the top .  and denzel , well , what can you say about mr . washington that hasn't already been said before ?  he comes through as per his usual high-level style here , and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent , of which , i personally would like to see more .  he's nice , he's not so nice , he's smart , he's not so smart , he's caring and he's a dog all the way .  the few problems that i did have with this film included the redundant nature of the whole thing at some point ( okay , we get it . . . you  have to be nasty in order to deal with these nasty people . . . move on ) and this one really major "" coincidence "" which involved a bathtub , that saved the day for one character , but seemed a little too "" convenient "" for my taste .  i also never really understood how washington's character got out of a certain dire predicament , only to be seen driving his car in the very next scene .  but obviously these small flaws didn't taint my overall enjoyment of this tense drama , a film that gets you right into the streets , into the nooks and the crannies , and into the moral dilemma which lies between the justice system and the day-to-day drug busts .  see it if you want to wrestle with some of these issues yourself , see it if you want to see denzel and ethan strike up a palpable chemistry on-screen , and see it if you like holding on to your seat-handles real tight during a movie .  in fact , see it for the scene in which ethan hawke plays cards with a host of gang-bangers alone . . . dang , now that's intense !  where's joblo coming from ?  the corruptor ( 7/10 ) - crimson tide ( 9/10 ) - l . a . confidential ( /10 ) - lethal weapon ( 8/10 ) - requiem for a dream ( 8/10 ) - seven ( 10/10 ) - shaft ( 7/10 ) - traffic ( 8/10 )  "|0.5666666666666668|0.8666666666666667|0.7333333333333334|The majority of the explanations point to a positive sentiment towards the movie, highlighting its solid acting, thrilling ending, and ability to make the audience think about moral dilemmas.

1|wow ! what a movie .  it's everything a movie can be : funny , dramatic , interesting , weird , funny , weird and strikingly original .  yep that pretty much describes this movie .  it starts out like a regular movie and ends up being one of the weirdest , funniest most original movies i have ever seen .  it boggles the mind and some have to wonder why we cannot get movies like this more often .  besides being one of the best films of the year , being john malkovich may as well be one of the best movies ever .  period .  then again there are so many good movies , that one cannot pick an all time favorite .  john cusack plays a puppeteer craig schwartz a man out of a job , in search of a job .  his wife lotte schwartz who is played by a completely un-noticeable cameron diaz who looks like something off the streets is an animal lover and has about every kind of animal you could think of .  craig finds a job as a file at the 7 ? floor of a business building . . . you  have to pry open the elevator doors open before it reaches floor eight , the 7 ? floor is just a floor between 7 and 8 .  he is hired by his 105 year old boss ( orsen bean ) to be a filer .  in his office , he discovers a little door , to which was boarded up and hidden .  to his curiosity he opens it and starts to crawl toward it , he then gets sucked to the end and ends up in john malkovich's mind .  fifteen minutes later he is shot out onto the side of the new jersey turnpike .  he returns to tell his co-worker maxine ( catherine keener ) that he has found a portal that will lead him into john malkovich's mind , she doesn't believe him but after she sees it it changes her mind .  lotte also finds out about the portal and discovers that being someone else is good after all .  john malkovich of course has no idea what is going on , and by the end of this bizarre film there are so many twists and turns , that we don't know what really happened .  john cusack is outstanding and utterly believeable in a role only he himself could play .  he fits the role perfectly and to me was brilliantly cast .  cameron diaz is outstanding and utterly one of the world's most prettiest women , is made up here unnoticeable and very unattractive .  she however gives a very comic performance and this could easily be her best role to date .  catherine keener is very funny and sexy as maxine and of course the best thing of the movie is the magic himself john malkovich who is very brilliant and this movie plays big time homage ? to the master himself .  the whole group combined gives us a wonderfully funny movie that is also smart and clever .  spike jonze ( three kings ) makes his fabulous directing debut , and did a fantastic job of directing this new classic film .  he lets the viewer go on the trip as well as let the viewer know they are watching a movie .  by the time the ending rolled around my head was spinning from disbelief of how good this film was .  the screenplay written by charlie kaufman was hilarious and often thought-provoking .  the film also had a soft side to it and even though the ending is very surprising it is also a little sad and heart-warming .  the whole movie was fantastic and had me rolling in the isles .  from cameron diaz's appearence to john malkovich's explorations i laughed very hard , and it may as well be as funny as as good as it gets ( the funniest ! ) .  there isn't a slow point in the movie , or an overused idea .  there are no cliches except for the fact that this is the most original , inventie , witty , and smart movie i've seen in a long time .  i found myself amazed by everything : the direction , acting , writing and the whole idea of the movie .  by the end i had to wonder why hollywood doesn't want to make movies like this anymore .  or why they don't .  all filmmakers watch this movie and get some ideas of movies to come out .  this was a surprise hit as was american beauty .  'being john malkovich' is in the top 5 movies of the year , and in the top 10 best films ever made .  it has something that no other movies playing now has .  in fact it may as well be the best movie out right now .  i highly recommend 'being john malkovich' and have no doubts you will be disappointed .  |0.9166666666666666|0.9500000000000001|0.8833333333333333|The summary explanation is that the movie is highly praised for being funny, dramatic, interesting, and original, with outstanding performances and fantastic directing, resulting in a very positive sentiment.

1|"glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war .  broderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle .  shaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society .  the letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory .  as the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces .  like private eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces .  shaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck .  soon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort .  glory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery .  the film periodically jumps between shaw's point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers .  the movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action .  the large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth .  he is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight .  his bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability .  washington provides much of the film's intensity and emotional power .  in one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army .  when he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave .  it makes your blood boil .  the humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington's cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well .  the episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn't deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores .  freeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role .  he plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember .  he quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers .  colonel shaw recognizes freeman's leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army .  andre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw's close childhood friends .  searles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him "" snow flake . ""  the burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat .  the road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment .  the soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale .  the army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination .  they are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms .  to make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor .  eventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw .  shaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail .  broderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment .  unfortunately , however , broderick's uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie .  in an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent .  he is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced .  the film places too much weight on broderick's character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing .  glory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war .  the movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july .  glory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts .  except for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid .  to the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it's just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of "" thirtysomething "" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster .  the key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers .  the movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals .  in one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire .  each man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration .  a couple of the movie's most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride .  the regiment's greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner .  like any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north's victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america .

1|"steven spielberg's second epic film on world war ii is an unquestioned masterpiece of film .  spielberg , ever the student on film , has managed to resurrect the war genre by producing one of its grittiest , and most powerful entries .  he also managed to cast this era's greatest answer to jimmy stewart , tom hanks , who delivers a performance that is nothing short of an astonishing miracle .  for about 160 out of its 170 minutes , "" saving private ryan "" is flawless .  literally .  the plot is simple enough .  after the epic d-day invasion ( whose sequences are nothing short of spectacular ) , capt . john miller ( hanks ) and his team are forced to search for a pvt .  james ryan ( damon ) , whose brothers have all died in battle .  once they find him , they are to bring him back for immediate discharge so that he can go home .  accompanying miller are his crew , played with astonishing perfection by a group of character actors that are simply sensational .  barry pepper , adam goldberg , vin diesel , giovanni ribisi , davies , and burns are the team sent to find one man , and bring him home .  the battle sequences that bookend the film are extraordinary .  literally .  there is nothing in film that has ever been recorded that will prepare you for the sheer onslaught of terrorizing violence in the film's first 20 minutes .  spielberg films almost the entire movie without music , leaving it up to the characters to generate emotion , and they do to perfection .  the sequences in france , all of them , beginning with the battle and ending with the battle , are fabulous , especially the dialogues between the men as they walk through the hills and countrysides , trying to save private ryan .  there are no words i can use to describe the true horror and power of these sequences .  this is what coppola was looking for in "" apocalypse now "" , but couldn't create .  the sheer horror of these sequences all but condemn war .  the performance by hanks as the leader of this gang is also extraordinary .  he is head and shoulders above of the rest of the actors in the world , with his comic timing , dramatic flair , his quiet emotion that stirs an entire nation to tears .  hanks is this country's finest actor , and he proves it here .  however , spielberg almost destroys his own masterpiece .  with a chance to make it the one of the greatest films of all time , spielberg creates 10 minutes of purely worthless film .  the sequence involving army chief-of-stafff george marshall and mrs . ryan is decent , but doesn't hold up to the rest of the film , relying on wartime cliches to power it .  but that is forgivable .  what isn't is the bookends of the film , the cemetary sequences .  the first one is quite good , a decent introduction into the lives of these men .  the last sequence is atrocious .  the forced emotion , accompanied by a ridiculous piece of music , is simply horrible compared to the rest of the magical film .  these flaws are what downgrade "" ryan "" from the greatest film of our era , to the greatest war film of our era .  spielberg should have trusted his own material , and he should have trusted hanks to deliver the most chilling line of the movie , to end his masterpiece right there .  the use of the flag , though patriotic , is in contrast to the movie's theme .  the power of the bulk of the film , however , is astonishing .  spielberg has truly made a wondrous work of art , that persists even after first viewing of the film , is extraordinary .  this is the film of the year .

1|"truman ( "" true-man "" ) burbank is the perfect name for jim carrey's character in this film .  president truman was an unassuming man who became known worldwide , in spite of ( or was it because of ) his stature .   "" truman "" also recalls an era of plenty following a grim war , an era when planned communities built by government scientists promised an idyllic life for americans .  and burbank , california , brings to mind the tonight show and the home of nbc .  if hollywood is the center of the film world , burbank is , or was , the center of tv's world , the world where our protagonist lives .  combine all these names and concepts into "" truman burbank , "" and you get something that well describes him and his artificial world .  truman leads the perfect life .  his town , his car , and his wife are picture perfect .  his idea of reality comes under attack one day when a studio light falls from the sky .  the radio explains that an overflying airplane started coming apart .   .   .  but then why would an airplane be carrying a studio light ?  the next day during the drive to work , the radio jams and he starts picking up a voice that exactly describes his movements .  he is so distracted that he nearly hits a pedestrian .  when the radio comes back to normal , the announcer warns listeners to drive carefully .  his suspicion aroused , he wanders around the town square looking for other oddities .  the world appears to be functioning properly until he enters an office building and tries to take the elevator .  the elevator doors open up on a small lounge with people on coffee breaks .  a grip sees truman him and quickly moves a paneled door , made to look like the back of an elevator , into place .  two security guards grab him and throw him out .  truman is really suspicious now .  it gets even worse the next day when his wife , a nurse , describes an elevator accident in the building where he saw the lounge .   "" it's best not to think about it , "" she says , trying vainly to change truman's memory .  truman becomes determined to see who or what is behind this apparently elaborate hoax at his expense .  at every turn he is stopped by an amazing coincidence that just happens to keep him in his own little town .  his last hope is to quell his fear of the ocean and sail to the edge of the world .  you know by now that truman's life is the subject of a television program .  his actions are "" real "" but everything else is carefully scripted , from the death of his father to the choice of his wife .  truman is determined to find out what the big hoax is .  meanwhile , christof , the all-seeing creator of truman's world does his best to keep him unaware and happy .  it's sort of like westworld told from the robots' point of view , or jurassic park from the dinosaurs' point of view .  we root for the captive of the cage-world .  our protagonist is counting on "" chaos theory "" to help him escape his elaborate trap .  the story , written by andrew niccol ( writer/director of gattaca ) , introduces some interesting questions , such as the ethics of subjecting a person to this type of life , or the psychological impact of learning that your entire life has all been fake .  although these questions came to mind , i don't think the film itself asked them .  it certainly didn't address them or try to answer them .  i was particularly disappointed that the film didn't deal more with the trauma of learning one's life is a tv show .  carrey's performance at the end showed a smidgen of truman's pain , but i almost felt that he got over it too easily for the sake of the film's pacing .  earlier in the movie i found myself wondering if it would be better for truman to find out the truth or whether i should root for him to be well .  the two seemed exclusive of one another , but weir and niccol didn't see it that way .  perhaps it's not fair to criticize a movie for what it isn't , but it seems like there were some missed opportunities here .  but on its own terms , the movie is well made .  sight , sound and pacing are all handled competently .  much of the first part of the movie is the truman show .  the scenes are all apparently shot from hidden cameras , with snoots and obstructions covering the corners of the screen .  one hidden camera is apparently in his car radio , the green led numbers obscuring the lower part of the screen .  the music is well-chosen and scored .  the film opens with what sounds like family drama theme music , when truman's world is still beautiful and perfect .  when the movie ends , the score sounds more like a frantic , driven , tangerine dream opus , while still keeping the same timbre .  philip glass' epic music ( from powaqqatsi ) permeates truman's scenes of suspicion and awakening .   ( glass has a small cameo as a keyboardist for the show . )  and the pacing of the story was brisk .  there was no unnecessarily long setup explaining the concept behind the truman show , just a few quick title cards , a few interviews , and then right into the show , and the movie .  one of the first scenes is of the studio light falling ; there was no token scene of truman's idyllic life before it falls apart , because it wasn't necessary , we pick up the story at the first sign of trouble , and no sooner .  there's also no point in the movie where the plot slows down .  it's a quick , straight shot to the movie's end .  in terms of overall quality , i would compare the truman show to niccol's gattaca .  both films are well made with interesting stories set in interesting worlds .  but neither film really felt like it capitalized on all the great ideas ; neither film "" clicked "" and became an instant classic .  nevertheless , i look forward to niccol's next film , whatever it may be .
