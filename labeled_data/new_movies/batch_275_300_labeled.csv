1|"after the press screening of "" moulin rouge , "" i stood in the lobby of the theater listening to the reactions of my friends and colleagues .  everyone seemed a bit numb , understandable after sitting through a barrage of often-incongruous sounds and images .  a pal of mine simply said that he loved the film and could hardly wait to take his wife to see it .  another enthusiast immediately began to analyze the production , while a woman who flat-out hated the movie gave him the skunk eye .  when one fellow quietly stated "" i've never really been a fan of musicals , "" the statement surprised me because , even though the story is told almost completely through song , i didn't think of it as a musical .  there is so much going on in "" moulin rouge "" that "" musical "" seems too small a term to cover it .   "" moulin rouge "" is the kind of creation that sends critics scurrying off to the big tub o' adjectives in search of proper words to describe the experience .  australian director baz luhrmann , the man behind "" strictly ballroom "" and "" romeo + juliet , "" fills the heads of viewers with unique camerawork , opulent imagery and songs ranging from "" the sound of music "" to "" smells like teen spirit . ""  sumptuous and beautiful , vulgar and overdone , "" moulin rogue "" travels through the looking glass while an ethereal stereo loaded with 50 years worth of catchy tunes operates on the "" random "" setting .  oh , and it has a story as well .   "" it was 1899 , the summer of love . . .   "" christian ( ewan mcgregor ) is a penniless young writer newly arrived in paris , "" to write about truth , beauty , freedom and love , "" where he encounters a group of bohemians , led by henri de toulouse-lautrec ( john leguizamo ) .  christian meets satine ( nicole kidman ) , a courtesan from the legendary moulin rogue , and his world transforms from black and white to technicolor .  at once fragile and vivacious , the dazzling red-haired woman sweeps him off his feet without even trying .  christian instantly falls in love with her and satine finds herself smitten with him as well , which is quite a hindrance for someone in her profession .  working with the bohemians and moulin rogue impresario harold zidler ( jim broadbent ) , christian writes an opus modestly named "" spectacular spectacular . ""  zidler quickly finds a backer , the wealthy duke of monroth ( richard roxburgh ) , but there's a catch ? the duke also wants the hand of the fair satine .  as if all that isn't enough , satine has a cough , and while a cough in the real world probably indicates a cold , it rarely turns out to be anything that simple in movie land .  like a teeter-totter , "" moulin rogue "" moves up and down between the ridiculous and the sublime .  one of the loveliest moments comes as christine and satine commune outdoors at night , becoming part of a defiantly unrealistic parisian cityscape straight from a book of fairy tales .  together they dance , while serenaded by the man in the moon ( alessandro safina provides the vocals ) , apparently transported from the classic georges m ? li ? s silent film to guard the nocturnal sky .  other scenes merely traffic in everything-and-the-kitchen-sink overload .  the cavorting of toulouse-lautrec and his comrades gets strained at times and some of their overt comedy , accompanied by cartoon sound effects , is overly reminiscent of the frenzied farce that sitcoms like "" bewitched "" beat into the ground .  of course , sensory overload was exactly what baz luhrmann had in mind .   "" we never heard from baz to turn it down , "" one of the actors told the los angeles times .   "" it was always , 'more !  more ! ' ""  the director even sent a note to his cast reading , "" i dare you to make me say you've gone too far . ""  the musical numbers reflect his attitude .  one knockout piece , the "" elephant love medley , "" incorporates the beatles' "" all you need is love , "" u2's "" in the name of love , "" dolly parton's "" i will always love you "" and elton john and bernie taupin's "" your song . ""  need more ?  how about "" diamonds are a girl's best friend "" spiced with portions of "" material girl ? ""  luhrmann's cast offers a wide variety of approaches that , together , add up to something messy , but often wonderful .  ewan mcgregor is extremely likable as christian , emphasizing the sincerity of the love-struck poet .  mcgregor's singing voice is robust and adds vigor at just the right moments .  once labeled the "" ice queen , "" nicole kidman melts that characterization with a sizzling , yet tender , performance .  she handles the songs adroitly , although her voice sounds a bit thin in the upper range .  veteran character actor jim broadbent is suitably larger than life as ringmaster zidler ? wait until you see him perform "" like a virgin . ""  as the buffoonish duke , richard roxburgh proves to be the film's weakest link , although i'm sure he was simply following instructions .  i suspect "" moulin rogue "" will be one of those love-it-or-hate-it films .  while i didn't completely love it , i most certainly liked it a lot .  over the course of a year , i see well over 300 movies , and most of them look like xeroxes of each other .   "" moulin rogue "" is an original , and an original , even a flawed one , is a thing to be cherished .

1|" "" living out loud , "" is the type of motion picture we don't often see : it is a film about mature , intelligent adults , instead of the usual american film , in which children basically dress up in grown-up clothing and parade around acting like immature seven-year-olds .  judith ( holly hunter ) , a fortysomething living in new york city , has been having a difficult time with life lately .  she is extremely depressed about her recent divorce to her husband ( martin donovan ) , who had been cheating on her .  she cannot sleep , haunted by terrible memories , often imagines off-the-wall things to try and make the world seem like a better place , and the only place she can really go to feel happy is to hear one of her favorite singers , liz bailey ( queen latifah ) , perform at a local club .  judith's life does start to brighten a little when , one night when she gets home to her apartment late , strikes up a conversation with the elevator operator , pat ( danny devito ) , a lonely man in his fifties whom has lost his daughter recently .  both of them create a sort of emotional connection with each other , seeking comfort with the other person , but while pat starts to form a deep love for her , judith only wants to remain friends .   "" living out loud , "" which was written by richard lagravenese ( "" the bridges of madison county "" ) , who is also making his directing debut here , is a wonderful film from beginning to end , one that is honest , genuinely funny , and poignant .  the three central characters , that of judith , pat , and liz , are all written to be free-thinking , complex human beings , and are all likable , but flawed , people who are constantly interesting , as is the film itself .  one highly original element of the film is that judith occasionally imagines things occuring in her mind in the way she wishes they would happen .  sometimes it results in comedy , and sometimes it turns out to be subtle and truly touching .  one sequence that stands out is when judith is at a restaurant by herself , reading a novel .  an older woman comes over to her , mentions that that is a great book she is reading , and then goes over to join her own friends .  as the woman sits down , she looks over to see judith by herself , and motions for her to come join them .  instantly , we realize this was simply in judith's mind , as we see the same woman just sit down at the table and begin talking to her friends .  holly hunter and danny devito both give the performances of their careers here .  hunter , of course , was brilliant in 1993's "" the piano , "" for which she won an academy award , but in this film she is even better , i think .  she finds the right note for each scene and holds it .  and devito has never had such a humanistic role before , which i was surprised about .  usually he is used as the butt of a joke , or as a caricature , but in this film , has a living-and-breathing , sympathetic person to play .  topping it all off is latifah , also a singer , who is quickly turning into a respectable actress herself , and has a juicy , natural supporting role as , in some ways , judith's role model .  another joy of the film is that it does not somehow form a contrived , "" happy "" ending , but , in staying with its realistic tone , manages to be upbeat , but truthful .  the last shot is an especially powerful image .  nothing is said , but just the image of someone walking down a sidewalk says it all .  the relationship that results between judith and pat is true-to-life and sincere .  as we watch these two people talk , and get to know each other , all that we wish for them both is to be happy , even if that does not include for them to become romantically involved .  and as , "" living out loud , "" which is one of the best films of the year , proves , sometimes a friendship is the strongest bond anyone could possibly ask for .

1|written by john grisham and robert altman ( as al hayes )  directed by robert altman  some time ago , a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel .  the novel was a summer smash , topping best-seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads .  the only problem : the novel wasn't very good .  it was far more pulp than pulitzer .  but the director realized that , no matter how pedestrian the prose , this book really grabbed people - that the author , while not a great writer , was a fantastic storyteller .  so he took on the project , convinced he could make something happen on screen .  the director ?  francis ford coppola .  the book , of course , was mario puzo's the godfather .  the rest , as they say in showbiz , was history .  by bringing up the godfather , i don't mean to suggest that robert altman's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness .  but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material .  can you get any more questionable than john grisham ?  depends on whom you ask .  but there's no question that grisham's work grabs people .  like puzo , grisham is a better storyteller than a writer - unlike fellow hack michael crichton , who is a good idea man but who can't tell a well-constructed story from a can of spam .  so something in grisham's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman , who at 73 years old remains one of america's greatest living filmmakers .  the result is a gripping thriller that , while falling short of classic cinema , deserves its place in the altman canon .  >from its opening shot to the closing credits , the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread , with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe .  this terrific sense of mood is a classic altman touch .  witness said opening shot : we see an aerial view of coastal georgia with its writhing , undulating landscape while the soundtrack grumbles ominously in our ear .  we roll over the hills into the town of savannah , then zoom in close on a red sports car speeding over a bridge while its driver chatters oblivious on his cell phone .  right away we know that the driver of that car is in for a few surprises .  pay attention , boys and girls - this shot was not conceived by john grisham , but by altman .  this is what a great director can do for questionable source material .  the sports car belongs to rick magruder ( kenneth branagh ) , the aforementioned hotshot attorney who specializes in police brutality cases .  magruder has just won a high profile case and celebrates that night with a catered party at his office .  outside after the party he meets one of the waitresses , mallory doss ( embeth davidzt ) , just as she realizes her car has been stolen .  driven by southern chivalry , a driving rainstorm and his unspoken attraction to the fragile waitress , magruder offers her a ride home .  there he learns more about mallory's life than he bargained for .  her car was stolen by her schizophrenic father dixon ( robert duvall ) , a ted kyzynski-style whacko who has been stalking and terrorizing his own daughter .  magruder , perhaps influenced by mallory's decision to strip off her wet clothes in front of him , is sympathetic to her plight , and offers to help her get her father committed - right after he sleeps with her , of course .  this simple offer of help leads magruder down a dangerous path with a black end .  he succeeds in having dixon incarcerated in a mental hospital , and for a moment all appears well .  but then dixon's crack team of homeless commandos bust him out of the lockup - and suddenly magruder finds himself , mallory and his own children in danger .  the cops won't lift a finger to help a liberal attorney .  his only allies are his faithful assistant lois ( daryl hannah ) and his bumbling private-eye sidekick clyde ( robert downey jr ) .  if this predicament wasn't bad enough , hurricane geraldo is bearing down on savannah and throwing the world into chaos .  altman may provide the atmosphere , but branagh's performance holds the gingerbread man together .  an accomplished actor when he isn't directing himself in vanity productions , branagh does a fine job of making rick a sympathetic hero while casting doubt upon his motives .  is his offer of help to mallory an act of kindness , or of egotism ?  magruder is so sure of his place in the world that he never considers that he has bitten off more than he can chew until he has to swallow it - and by then it's too late .  as the plot unfolds , magruder learns that none of us are as secure as we think we are .  and life is never so bad that it can't get worse .  if you're familiar with altman's work , you'll recognize several of his signature techniques .  characters are not introduced in establishing shots , but rather are allowed to wander in the background of scenes until their importance becomes apparent .  crucial scenes are shot from the outside through windows , making the audience unwitting voyeurs of the action .  dialog overlaps and the actors seem to slip naturally into an improvisational style .  and of course there's my favorite altman technique - the obligatory nude actress shot .  thanks to altman , here are some of the actresses i've had the pleasure of seeing naked : sally kellerman , julianne moore , madeline stowe , even frances mcdormand .  and now i can add embeth davidtz , who looks quite healthy in the altogether .  the naked actress shot has become as ubiquitous to the altman film as the director cameo was to the hitchcock film .  is it old-school sexism , or a clever in-joke ?  you be the judge .  but back to the picture at hand .  in the hands of a mere mortal , the gingerbread man would have been a routine thriller , no better or worse than the countless others we've all endured .  in the hands of a master like altman , it becomes an exercise in existential doom , in its own way far more successful than scorsese's cape fear remake , which tried for the same result .  what may prevent it from enduring with altman's greatest work is a weak third act - in fact , there really is no third act in grisham's story , so it appears that altman had to throw in the hurricane just to jazz things up .  but there are true moments of riveting suspense , and great performances by branagh , davidzt and downey jr - more than enough to see you through .  that polygram so hated this picture that they tried to steal final cut from altman , and then buried the marketing campaign when he won it back , should tell you how utterly clueless of quality most studios are .  they probably wanted it to look more like a time to kill .  and that , my friends , should make you very afraid .  |0.39999999999999997|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment of the explanations is moderately positive, with praise for director Robert Altman's ability to create a gripping thriller from questionable source material and high regard for the performances by the actors.

1|"october sky is a rare oddity in cinema : a self-proclaimed "" uplifting "" film that is actually uplifting !  based on the autobiographical book by homer hickam , rocket boys , october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream .  it's 1957 , and for the boys of coalwood , west virginia , there's not much hope of a rosy future .  coalwood is a coal mining town , and , except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship , most of coalwood's boys are destined to work in the mine .  but , in october 1957 , an event happens that sparks one boy to dream .  the launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) to dream a future of rocketry and space travel .  of course , homer's parents ( chris cooper and natalie canderday ) aren't quite sure what to make of their son's unusual interests .  homer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley ( laura dern ) , a teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of a national science fair .  and so , with stars in his eyes , and thoughts of scholarships in his head , homer enlists the help of three other boys ( william lee scott , chad lindberg and chris owen ) and begins to build a rocket .  but , do these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their destiny ?  there is a lot that could have gone wrong with october sky .  nearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched .  however , miraculously , october sky avoids nearly all of these pitfalls , making the exact right moves at the exact right times .  a film emerges which manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness .  jake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film .  >from the outset of the film , he is immediately likable , and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience .  unfortunately , while october sky focuses on homer , the other three kids get the short end of the stick .  they remain little more than placeholders reading "" insert friend here "" .  of the adults in the film , chris cooper is the most fully realized character .  the film never paints him as merely the villainous parent standing in the way of his child's dreams , but , instead , shows the multihued portrait of a man who wants the best for his family and town , but is too stubborn to realize what that is .  director joe johnson deserves much credit for successfully navigating the many obstacles that october sky manages to dodge .  however , there are still a few occasions when he allows things to proceed just a step too far .  scenes which were natural and inspiring start to become contrived and artificial .  however , these lapses are minimal , and johnson quickly steers the movie back on course .  the problem with many so-called "" uplifting "" films is that they attempt to force their mediciney goodness down your throat .  october sky never resorts to that level , and yet , manages to become a truly uplifting film purely on its own merits .

1|while watching boiler room , i was constantly reminded of last year's masterpiece fight club .  both films consist of a predominately male cast .  both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires .  and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator , who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped .  while boiler room writer/director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club , he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation .  a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire .  paying homage to oliver stone's 1987 classic wall street , younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger , hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older , more experienced types .  as is true in real life , younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology .  boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages .  another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks .  some people are convinced that an all-male cast automatically means there must be gory violence , here is proof that this is not true .  if you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck , go see reindeer games this weekend .  if you want to see a smart , insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script , see boiler room .  giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film's narrator , seth .  after dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment , seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man ( nicky katt ) .  he agrees to take the job ( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years ) of selling stock to well-off americans from the mid-west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co-workers .  learning tricky techniques to deceive innocent people into buying shares of a good in production , seth figures this is too good to be true .  after stumbling into a room at the wrong time , he knows there is something no good about this company .  at this point , seth is left with the ultimate choice ; continue with the american dream and make millions or tell the authorities that something fishy is going on .  ribisi is believable as seth especially when he shares scenes with ron rifkin , playing seth's dad .  the two have perfect chemistry as a troubled father and son trying to impress each other and simultaneously impress themselves .  the transitions from anger to sympathy that these scenes contain are the standout segments of the entire film .  the supporting cast of greedy co-workers is also flawless .  ben affleck shines in a short but sweet performance as a recruiter for the company , nicky katt is fabulous as the ostensibly friendly boss who eventually becomes extremely jealous of seth , and vin diesel gives his best performance of his career as the foil character of nicky katt .  the energy of the cast as a whole makes boiler room well paced and never boring .  the only major error in the film is that nothing major happens .  there is no big plot twist or climatic point to make the film more memorable .  due to the lack of a major event , boiler room never finds a suitable genre to fit into .  the movie is not intense enough to be a thriller , the romantic segments involving seth and abby ( nia long ) are not properly finalized , and the dialogue isn't funny enough to make it a comedy .  in having trouble to characterize the movie as a whole , boiler room is slightly confused at times .  it doesn't seem to know which category to fit itself into .  one satisfying concluding scene could have changed the whole film for the better .  otherwise , the movie is fun to watch thanks to its lively cast of young actors .  |0.4123333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|"The film ""Boiler Room"" receives a generally positive review for its clever script, insightful nature, and outstanding acting, particularly Giovanni Ribisi's performance.

1|"ok , let's get one thing straight right away : maximum risk is no battleship potemkin ( although it does have some russians in it ! ) , but it's not too bad , really .  it's the new film from ringo lam , the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood , and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium , jean-claude van damme ( who , you will recall , also starred in john woo's maiden hollywood effort , hard target ) .  in lam's film , van damme plays alain moreau , a french cop ( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target ) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians .  these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york ( where , i suppose , they thought they wouldn't be noticed ) .  this brother , mikhail suverov ( played in his few scenes by . . . well ,  you know ) , becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi ( almost the same thing , i guess ) , and is killed in france ( in the movie , things happen so fast that you don't have too much time to think about how weird this all is ) .  moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed , and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed ( we wonder the same thing ; i still do ) .  in little odessa , he meets mikhail's girlfriend , alex ( natasha henstridge , last seen in species ) , who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise-en-scene ( she has very nice breasts , and we get to seen them briefly in this movie ; it was rated r in the us but is pg here , so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do ) .  this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken arrow , the fugitive , hard target , or anything starring arnold , but that works to its benefit , i think .  after all , one thing that's been missing from woo's hollywood films is that certain hong kong funkiness that we all know and love ( well , some of us do ) .  movies like this shouldn't be too pretentious , and that is part of the problem with some of these other films : they try to be too "" big "" in terms of special effects and sheer spectacle .  maximum risk has its share of car chases and explosions , but they don't overwhelm the movie or detract our attention from the narrative ( not too much , anyway ) .  the emphasis throughout is on the characters and their interactions ( even if , at times , they don't make a hell of a lot of sense ) .  in fact , one of the more interesting aspects of the film is a minor character , a rather overeager new york cabbie ( frank van keeken from tv's "" kids in the hall "" ) , who begins as something of a joke but becomes an important part of the story .  unfortunately , by the time we have come to really get interested in him , he . . . well ,  you'll see .  the movie also features some set pieces of the type that we have come to expect from lam and his hong kong compatriots .  one is a fight in a russian sauna , with lots of sweaty , muscular male flesh ( this one will appeal to certain parts of the audience more than others ) , bullets in heads , and vodka .  another , my personal favorite , is a fight in a meat packing house , featuring pig carcasses and a chainsaw .  and even the predictable car chases are more hong kong than hollywood , as they trash those quaint french cafes , vegetable carts , and , well , french people that , we all know in our hearts , deserve trashing just for being so damn quaint .  of course , the movie does have its share of silliness .  for example , while beating the crap out of an obnoxious russian thug who obviously deserves what he's getting , alain stops long enough to look at his own reflection in the cracked mirror with which he has been whacking the guy on the head .  in an unnecessarily dramatic moment , he apparently is shocked at what he sees , at what he has become .  but what has he become ?  a tough cop who beats the hell out of a guy who tried to kill him ?  doesn't sound too unreasonable to me , considering the genre .  but let's face it , any time van damme tries to be dramatic , he looks silly .  so maximum risk is a little different from most other action films .  while watching it , i was surprised , and a little disappointed , in the relative lack of pyrotechnics .  but watching some of these other action films is sort of like experiencing a sugar rush ; after the initial excitement , there's not much left .  although it's short on spectacle , lam's film leaves a better and more lasting impression , i think .  i'm more impressed by it now than i was while watching it , and to me , that's a good sign .  go see maximum risk , but don't expect a typical hollywood action movie ; expect a sort of funky hong kong-hollywood action movie .  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  dr t . white teaches film at the english language and literature department of the national university of singapore , but we don't hold this against him .

1|trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi-dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda , the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter .  the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60's , then cut to the harsh reality of the present .  sheffield has become some sort of a semi-slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel-factories ; a once flourishing industry .  gaz ( carlyle ) spends most of his time in the worker's club , a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers .  he and his `plump' friend dave ( addy ) as well as their former foreman gerald ( wilkinson ) have been sitting around the club for months without any `call for duty' .  what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he cannot afford the 700 pounds of child-support money to his ex-wife .  suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son , he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild-idea to get the money he desperately requires .  dave and gerald too have problems of their own .  on top of his lack of employment , dave is also faced with the paranoia of his wife leaving him because of his current financial state as well as his`plump' appearance while gerald have been cheating on his wife by not telling her of his layoff for as long as 6 months , leaving home for `work' when he was actually a long-standing member of the worker's club .  there we have it ; people with real problems and a not-so-practical solution for them .  gaz manages to get the support from them and sure enough they managed to get a few other poor jobless blokes to join in their gag : to perform a strip-act at the local pub .  in gaz's own words while looking at an add for a strip-act featuring hunky `beautiful' men , `if women are willing to pay for this , they sure as well will pay for real-men' .  the full monty is very simple in nature and not a trace ambitious at all .  it is a small film which delves in the harsh-reality of unemployment and the desperation it drives people to .  it also is a very light movie to watch despite the theme it delves in because it has a lot of human-factor going for it .  never for once , was it trying to be manipulative at all , the full monty was true to itself all the way .  while the hilarity level of this film soared unexpectedly high , audience will find that they are in no way being cheated of a laugh , something lacking in many comedy films ( wannabes ? ) from hollywood .  other than carlyle , who acted as the psychotic begbie in trainspotting , the rest of the actors were definitely very new to me on-screen .  however , the acting presented in this film is more than satisfying .  carlyle's work here is a stark contrast to his character in trainspotting , implying real acting skill and flexibility on-screen .  kudos to the people involved in this film , especially to director peter cattaneo for being able to put together an excellent film which is has so much potential in ending up as your just-another-striptease .  already a critical and financial success for such a small film , the full monty is a humble film which deserves applause throughout .  while titanic managed to feast the eyes and soul in an epic way , the full monty gives one the same satisfaction ? ? . in  half the time .  |0.3972333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.7833333333333333|"The text contains positive sentiments towards the film ""The Full Monty,"" praising its success in British humor, comedy and human-factor, as well as its portrayal of real problems faced by unemployed individuals in a humorous and light-hearted way, commending the acting and direction."
1|" "" you'll go ape over tarzan because it's more fun than a barrel of monkeys ! ""  okay , there's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie .  disney's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning , skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship .  father , mother , and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins , and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson .  it's amazing , the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack .  before you know it , an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala ( glenn close ) , a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard .  against the wishes of her mate and family leader , kerchak ( lance henricksen ) , she takes on the infant boy as her own .  tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild .  much of tarzan's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his "" father , "" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well-meant his attempts .  all he's looking for is acceptance , perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers , but one which will ring true with a lot of adults .  when you really think about it , this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end .  look back on past disney animated features and you'll see the trend .  growing up , tarzan ( voiced by alex d . linz as a child , and by tony goldwyn as an adult ) has a couple of friends .  one is an ape named terk ( rosie o'donnell ) , and the other is a paranoid hypochondriac of an elephant named tantor ( wayne knight ) .  both provide the requisite comic relief ( timon and poombah from the lion king immediately come to mind ) and perform the usual hijinks as prescribed by the disney mold .  i'm beginning to think anyone can write the screenplay for one of these films .  just fill in the blanks !  can you see it ?   "" now we have to have a couple of zany friends for out hero who might get him into mischief , but cover for him or come to his rescue when he needs it .  we've already had a fish and a crab , and we've had a candle and a teapot , a genie and a dog , a few stone statues . . . . have  we had an ape and an elephant yet ?  well , there we go ! ""  of course , there's gotta be romance somewhere along the line , so jane ( minnie driver ) gets introduced about halfway through .  together with her father dr . porter ( nigel hawthorne ) and the big game hunter clayton ( brian blessed ) , jane is on an expedition to find and study the wild gorillas of africa .  she discovers the man raised by apes and is enchanted almost immediately , and soon shares an amusing version of the compulsory "" you tarzan , me jane "" scene .  thankfully , those aren't the exact words .  however , i found it distracting that tarzan is going "" ohh ohh ee ee "" one second and then tells jane his name in this manly voice with perfect diction .  how does he tell his name to another ape ?   "" ohh ohh ee - tarzan - ee ee ohh ? ""  well , regardless of my picky nature , the romance actually works as only disney romance can : purely contrived , but for some reason rather believable .  but hey , tarzan's a young adult .  do you think he dated a few of the female apes before meeting jane ?  isn't that illegal in most countries ?  oh , well .  i don't think disney will be using my quote anymore .  tarzan departs from the usual disney feature in that this one is not a musical .  there's lots of music to be sure , but not a single character song in the whole hour and a half of running time .  we instead get more of a phil collins concert , as no less than five of his original songs are used as interlude material .  this isn't really a bad thing , as the songs are very high-energy and catchy ( i found myself singing one to myself for most of the following day ) ; it's just different .  do yourself a favor and see this film in a theater with a good sound system , because the music will come through astonishingly well and really enhance the movie .  with each new feature , disney animation gets even better .  not necessarily by leaps and bounds , but since they put out a new film each year , a steady rate of improvement is apparent , and this definitely shows in tarzan .  there are a couple of scenes where the animation achieves a near 3-d effect , and a number of scenes which feature tarzan moving through the trees are absolutely dizzying .  the way he slides down tree limbs and trunks is very reminiscent of skateboarding and rollerblading maneuvers , and had me thinking this isn't just tarzan , it's "" extreme tarzan . ""  however , tarzan does not seem to have what i call its "" chandelier scene , "" which is the one scene to which the animators have chosen to devote an inordinate amount of effort , utilizing a computer-assisted process that makes the animation absolutely breathtaking .  lasting but a few seconds at most , it's been the signature of nearly every disney animated feature since beauty and the beast , in which the castle ballroom chandelier was rendered in stunning detail .  as usual , the voice talent is up to snuff , convincingly make you believe in the convictions of animated characters .  the one poor choice in casting , however , was rosie o'donnell .  going into the film , i didn't know she was even a part of it , but when terk started talking , i recognized her voice immediately .  her performance was fine , but through the rest of the film i kept thinking , "" that's no boy ape , that rosie o'donnell . ""  distracting to say the least .  i'll admit i've never read the edgar rice burroughs story "" tarzan of the apes , "" so i couldn't tell you how true this film stays to the book .  but unless you're a purist , you should have few objections to this film .  with solid performances , action , adventure , a bit of romance , and great music and animation , tarzan should appeal to the kids and to the kid in all of us .  note : when i wrote my review of mulan a year ago , i went off on the promotional and merchandising tie-ins prevalent with the release of a disney animated feature .  this time , i'll just say that i went to mcdonald's yesterday to treat myself to a mcflurry , and tarzan was on the cup .  'nuff said .

1|"according to hollywood movies made in last few decades , life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being .  even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark , god-forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience .  on the other hand , it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america , because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view .  this film is amarcord , 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini , which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages , and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life .  the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense .  instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs , as well as series of local , often very colourful characters .  although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator , movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist , 14-year old boy titta ( played by bruno zanin ) and chronicles his sexual frustrations , obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca ( played by magali noel ) , problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family , as well as troubles his father ( played by armando brancia ) have with mussolini's fascist regime .  amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film , and it probably explains why it is very popular , even among those people who actually don't like federico fellini's work very much .  every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film , because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible .  distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film - word "" amarcord "" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase "" i remember "" in local italian dialect .  in the same way the word is distorted , so is the past in memories of those who remember it .  after the premiere , fellini rejected any claims about autobiographical character of this film , but it doesn't matter whether rimini of amarcord actually resembles rimini of fellini's childhood or not ; any place and any time could resemble characters and situations of this film .  fellini's views on nostalgia are clearly illustrated with a way he mixes reality and fantasy in this film .  even the most naturalistic scenes are laced with dark humour and grotesque images .  characters look like caricatures , actors playing them often deliberately overact , and women , especially those who fuel titta's sexual fantasies , often have certain body parts with gargantuan proportions .  every now and then , scenes that depict 1930s reality gradually slide into fantasies of movie's characters and rimini becomes almost indistinguishable from the magical place in characters' visions .  because of that , almost everything in this film looks different , and in most cases better , than it would have looked in the real life .  even the fascism gets fellinian make-over - fellini views mussolini's totalitarian regime as nothing more than visual spectacle ( explaining why similar regimes enjoyed such popular support throughout history ) and opportunity for comedy .  when fascists finally show their true colours and begin torturing their opponents , even this becomes opportunity for scenes of macabre humour .  unlike many of his italian colleagues in 1970s , who had used 1930s period setting to explicitly condemn fascism and serve fashionable political agenda , fellini doesn't care that much about politics .  lack of self-righteous moral perspective is compensated with fellini's humanistic approach to his characters .  each of them , regardless of age , gender , social class or physical appearance , is given opportunity to express his or her views , dreams and fears .  fellini treats all those characters with warmth and affection , even when he paints them as grotesque caricatures of real people .  because of this warmth and democratic spirit , amarcord could be viewed as one of the most humane films of 20th century , and it keeps its general feel good atmosphere despite depicting having many uncomfortable , melancholic and even tragic moments .  fellini couldn't produce such effects without using his own directorial talent that gave a very personal touch to this movie .  vignettes aren't memorable because of the characters only ; fellini uses camera , painting film in bright colours , especially in the scenes that depict character's fantasies .  fellini also knows how to use locations , whether such location happens to be luxurious hotel , bright-coloured beach or rural countryside .  even the down-to-earth streets of rimini , where everyone knows everyone , gets magical dimension during the snowfall .  on the other hand , lack of credible special effects somewhat diminished the same effect during the ocean liner scene .  this atmosphere is also provided by incredible talent of composer and fellini's long-time associate nino rota .  his amarcord theme is probably one of the most recognisable , most popular and most relaxing and uplifting pieces of film music ever produced .  that music alone should be the reason to view amarcord as one of the indisputable classics of seventh art .

( aside : notting hill's portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate . )  only anna's celebrity-or william's lack thereof-threatens to drive a wedge between them .  richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered , and for at least its first half-hour the picture's "" beauty and the beast "" -like scenario is ( romantic ) escapism of the highest order .  as with groundhog day or pleasantville , while watching the high-concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him/herself in the lead ; it's william's ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna .  curtis ( who previously penned four weddings and a funeral ) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple's situation is not enough to fuel two hours' worth of entertainment , so some of notting hill's finest moments revolve around william's eccentric friends and family .  by now , dear reader , you've probably heard a lot about rhys ifans' performance as william's imbecilic welsh flatmate .  yes , he's a crowd pleaser , a walking sight gag , but his character is not nearly as involving as the wheelchair-bound ( and appropriately named ) bella ( mckee , the anguished waitress of naked ) or max ( tom mcinnerny ) , her lousy chef of a husband .  in the movie's best sequence , william , anna , and company sit around bloated from max's latest concoction and hold a contest : the last brownie on the table goes to the diner with the saddest life .  the scene ends only as a british writer would end it .  if anything , fantastic bits like these dull the main plot's dramatic impact .  roberts and grant , especially , are appealing , but their relationship is convolutedly interrupted too many times ( four weddings' suffered similar flaws ) , and william and anna ultimately only have one thing in common : they're lonely .   ( worth noting in roberts' and grant's favour : the ubiquitous "" i'm just a girl , standing across from a boy , asking him to love her "" episode is not nearly so syrupy as it appears in clips , and it features some of the best emoting either actor has ever done . )  notting hill is nonetheless enjoyable ; on the visual side of things , i especially appreciated michell's playful changing-of-the-seasons number .  if only ( and this is a surprisinly minor gripe ) he had lopped off the egregious epilogue ; for a story that thrives on what we bring to it , the filmmakers work too hard to tidy things up , leaving our imaginations in the lurch .

1|"slavery is bad .  after hundreds of years , we've finally figured that one out .  this almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg's latest "" serious "" film .  during the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa's west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery .  fifty-three of them are stuffed into the "" la amistad "" ( from a spanish word for "" friendship "" ) by their new spanish owners .  freeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt .  after killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think .  instead the ship heads up the coast to the united states .  the amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy .  the legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property .  if they are property , who do they belong to ?  their masters ?  the spanish government ?  salvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ?  the us government ?  the defendants are pawns in several games .  abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause .  their lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees .  south carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states .  president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends .  when the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes .  even that doesn't work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims .  at the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners .  this little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america's past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court .  the slavery issue is easy pickin's for spielberg .  much like his "" shindler's list "" ( which followed "" jurassic park "" as this follows "" lost world "" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose .  nazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human .  it's not hard to see who the bad guys are .  without that question to ponder , the director's job is more difficult .  he has to make the story interesting .  spielberg succeeds for the most part .  the visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach .  where the movie falls down is a bit more subtle .  there are very few _people_ in the tale .  in fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out .  tappan and joadson are "" abolitionists "" : symbols but not humans .  van buren is a weak politician but nothing else .  the rest of the "" slaves "" barely exist other than dressing for the set .  like many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white .  the film's salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou .  the former model's first major role is a winner .  without speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog .  the other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in "" nixon "" ) .  the impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen .  there are some other great moments .  especially impressive are the african's struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land .  their interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant .  as grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans .  more humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film .

1|"reflecting on "" bedazzled , "" a lively comedy about the devil who seeks to possess the soul of a pathetic loser , one sinful thought remains in my mind .  if hell means having to spend an eternity with elizabeth hurley ( who portrays the fiery demon ) , then use that pitchfork and point me the way .  with her pouty lips , irresistible british accent , and wild display of haute couture , hurley crackles with naughtiness and fills your mind with temptation .  it's practically impossible to turn this beelzu-babe down .  her next target is elliot ( brendan fraser ) , a tech support geek who is clumsy , awkward , and just too eager to please .  to aptly picture him , you would have to remember a saturday night live skit featuring "" steve the copy guy "" who effortlessly irritated his co-workers with his unpolished social skills .  eugene , thus , is loathed and feared by his co-workers , who do their best to stay out of his way .  yet , beyond his annoying mannerisms , he's a lovable oaf .  he wishes that he could get closer to allison ( frances o'connor ) , a co-worker with whom he is infatuated but who has never taken notice of him .  however , the odds of him getting together with her are about the same as a snowball's chance in hell .   "" dear god , "" he prays .   "" i would give anything to have that girl in my life . ""  guess who then shows up ?  she makes an offer that is too hard to refuse .   "" seven utterly fabulous wishes for one piddling little soul . ""  there's even an escape clause .  if elliot's wish doesn't go exactly the way he likes , he need only 'beep' her ( one guess as to what the three-digit number is ) and he gets to start over .  the remainder of the film consists of elliot's various fantasies that incorporate his personal desire to have enormous amounts of wealth , power , fame and allison's love .  but when he makes sweeping statements such as "" i want to be very , very powerful and very , very rich and married to allison "" , he'll soon learn that the devil is in the details .  for example , ( and we've seen this several times in the trailers ) , he is granted his wish , but finds out that he's a columbian drug lord and that allison , while married to him , has her eyes on someone else .  apparently , the devil is just as eager to skew his fantasies as she is to possess his soul .  his other wishes also end up with some strange but funny twist that short-circuits his new life .  soon , elliot wishes that he had never made that deal .  given the mischievous nature of the devil , "" bedazzled "" has many amusing moments .  a lot of the credit goes to fraser who turns in a great comic performance .  he ably assumes various personas .  his funniest segment is when he wishes that he could be the most sensitive man in the world .  allison becomes so frustrated with him that she practically urges him to take advantage of her .  hurley also heightens the humor quotient , especially in the transitional scenes when fraser waits to start his next wish after bailing out of the previous one .  it's clear that she's having a good time with it all .  yet , while the filmmakers work hard at creating funny scenes , they conspicuously avoid developing the allegorical underpinnings between good and evil that could have added more heft to this story .  but that would be playing with fire .  what they've got works , so you can easily accept it for the pleasant little comedy that it is .

1|"since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller "" blood simple , "" joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic , original , and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood .  their films are highly stylized , deeply embedded in a particular time and place , and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances .  in "" the big lebowski , "" their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award-winning "" fargo , "" the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war , and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski , aka the dude .  the dude is played by jeff bridges -- one of hollywood's most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high .  the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties .  he has shaggy , shoulder-length hair , a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim , and he wears mostly stained tee-shirts , long shorts , and gellies without socks .  he smokes a lot of pot , drinks a lot of white russians , and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies , a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak ( john goodman ) and donny ( steve buscemi ) , one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation , but never quite makes it in .  one day , the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski ( david huddleston ) , this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife , bunny ( tara reid ) , owes a lot of people a lot of money .  the main plot and all its accompanying side-plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here .  suffice to say that the dude becomes deeply involved with the big lebowski when bunny is kidnaped and the dude is asked to be a courier for the ransom money .  by the time all is said and done , walter has become deeply involved , as has the big lebowski's daughter , maude ( julianne moore ) , a feminist performance artist , a pornographer named jackie treehorn ( ben gazzara ) , and a group of german nihilists led by peter stormare , who was so great as the silent but deadly kidnaper in "" fargo . ""   "" the big lebowski "" plays like an amalgam of all the coen brothers' earlier efforts .  it shares their previous films' strong sense of time and place , as well as their send-ups of movie genres and political and cultural ideologies .   "" lebowski "" has the same kind of crazed caricatures that made "" raising arizona "" such a hoot ; it has surrealistic dream sequences ( one of which involves a busby berkley-like dance number ) that characterized the ending of "" barton fink "" ; and it has the same kind of cartoonish look and feel that pervaded "" the hudsucker proxy . ""  the film was shot by veteran cinematographer roger deakins , who has worked with the coens on three other films , "" barton fink , "" "" the hudsucker proxy , "" and "" fargo . ""  deakins always gives the coens' films a distinctive visual style , and here he does a brilliant job of capturing the bright colors of seedy los angeles in the early nineties , whether that by the obnoxious blue bowling suit worn by the dude's main competitor jesus quintana ( john turturro ) , or the strikingly manic dream sequences , one of which involves the dizzy spectacle of watching a strike from a bowling ball's point of view .  if "" fargo "" was the coen brothers' most restrained effort in years , "" the big lebowski "" marks their return to over-the-edge filmmaking .  it is overflowing with style and attitude , which helps make up for the scattered plot fragments that never quite come together in the end .  the coens fill the screen with lighting , set design , music , and hilarious performances from all the leads , especially bridges and the always reliable john goodman , who shows real comic timing in his untimely 'nam-inspired outbursts and his intense dedication to his adopted judaism .  with joel directing , ethan producing , and both writing , the coen brothers seem limitless in their capacity to turn our world inside out .  their talent lies not in their ability to reflect the norms of reality , but in their potential to dig out the darkest corners of life and bring them to light .  the coens rejoice in the oddballs of the world , and they put them center-stage to show that it's not just guys like the dude who are nuts , but the entire planet .

1|lean , mean , escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by .  most are unnecessarily complicated , and others have no sense of expediency -- the thrill-ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot .  perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive , which featured none of the flash-bang effects of today's market but rather a bread-and-butter , textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about .  the latest tony scott movie , enemy of the state , doesn't make it to that level .  it's a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers , without looking back .  although director scott has made missteps in the past , such as the lame thriller the fan , he's generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun .  that vibrant spirit is present here , shown in well-timed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed .  enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography -- director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views , angles , lenses , and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie .  enemy is truly a visual experience , and that's only one of the reasons it's such a fun watch .  the movie lights up with an aging senator visited by nsa deputy chief thomas reynolds ( jon voight ) .  reynolds wants a new communications act passed to allow the government free reign in the use of surveilance equipment , but the senator plans to bury the bill in committee .  reynolds has the senator offed , but not before the murder is caught on a naturalist's camera .  by an extremist chain of events , the tape ends up in labor lawyer robert dean ( will smith ) 's posession , and it's not long before he's running from reynolds' cronies .  it's only with the help of an ex-spook named brill ( gene hackman ) that dean is able to get to the bottom of things .  the acting is top notch , and the three principles - smith , hackman , and voight - are generally more mature and excellent all around .  smith puts aside the wisecracking act and becomes a normal human being ; voight tones down the amount of sneer he puts into his character for greater ominpotence ; and hackman is simply over the top in the mysterioso role .  smith's regular joe comes off particularly well , as he runs from authorties for reasons that he knows not .  the supports are also in fine form , lending credibility to the main roles and advancing the plot in key areas .  this is , for the holiday crowd , the hot ticket ; as well as anyone looking for a serving of genuine action in a market that is otherwise lacking .  |-0.09999999999999999|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|"The text evaluates the movie ""Enemy of the State"" with both positive and negative statements.

1|"1992's alien3 marked not only the death ( by suicide ) of its popular protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , but , in many ways , the alien franchise itself--box office receipts were anemic , thanks to poor audience word of mouth ; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments , 1979's alien and 1986's aliens , savaged david fincher's slog of a sendoff ( myself included ) .  hence , weaver , director jean-pierre jeunet , and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two-fold challenge--not only somehow resurrect ripley , but also rescue this once-profitable series from the scrap heap .  despite the odds , they have succeeded , even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two .  writer joss whedon devises a quick , easy , and painless answer to the dead ripley problem--clone her , which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161 , the prison planet of the third film .  that done , the _real_ challenge presents itself--what do with her .  alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful ; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable , exploring her maternal side ; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death .  what could be next ?  whedon comes up with a clever spin : since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen , the blood used for the clone is also "" infected "" with alien dna .  so the new ripley is , indeed , new--a human/alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength , a psychic bond with the deadly species , and a more predatory attitude .  unfortunately , that is where alien resurrection's clever streak in writing stops .  the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features .  but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought .  the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding , but once the creatures break free , it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew ( this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers , including tough waif call , played by a game winona ryder ) trying to exterminate them .  and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential ; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy .  while the settling into tried-and-true formula is a little disconcerting , the formula is tried-and-true for a reason , and jeunet tackles the proceedings with giddy abandon .  the alien , after all these years , is still terrifying , and a new breed that is introduced is no less so .  the violence is appropriately grisly and extreme , and the action set pieces are suspenseful and exciting , most notably an extended underwater sequence .  the film is absolutely mesmerizing visually , thanks to the solid work done by production designer nigel phelps and cinematographer darius khondji .  as technically adept as jeunet's direction is , perhaps his ( and , for that matter , whedon's ) greatest contribution is the infusion of humor into this notably downbeat and serious series .  a sense of humor may seem to go against everything this horror show stands for , but the self-awareness of the excess just adds to the fun .  no , alien resurrection is not the great film that ridley scott's alien or the even greater film that james cameron's aliens was .  but after the dauntingly slow gloom and doom of fincher's alien3 , jeunet's resurrection is a welcome return to its roots as a wild , reckless thrill ride .  that is what made the alien series so popular in the first place , and that is what will keep the series popular in any future installments .

1|"most sequels don't do what they're supposed to do like "" toy story 2 "" does .  far too many of them end up re-hashing the original and adding very little .  is it any wonder that most sequels fail to live up to their predecessors ?  thankfully , "" toy story 2 "" is a wonderful exception .  i can't remember the last time i saw a sequel as consistently fun and inventive as this one .  it's yet another sign that pixar , the acclaimed animation studio behind "" toy story "" and "" a bug's life , "" is still at the top of its game .  woody and buzz are back in the sequel to the 1995 hit "" toy story , "" and things have changed a bit since the last one ended .  woody ( voiced by tom hanks ) is preparing to leave with his owner andy for cowboy camp .  in his absence , he has assigned buzz lightyear ( tim allen ) , now comfortable in his role as a toy , to take charge .  unfortunately , woody's trip is ruined when he is accidentally put into the family garage sale , and is stolen by an over-zealous toy collector ( wayne knight ) .  off to save him are buzz and members of the old "" toy gang , "" including mr . potato head ( don rickles ) , rex the nervous dinosaur ( wallace shawn ) , hamm the piggy bank ( john ratzenberger ) , and slinky dog ( jim varney ) .  while in captivity , woody makes a startling discovery : he is actually part of a collection of toys based on a 1950's children's show entitled "" woody's roundup . ""  he meets the show's other characters , which include jesse ( joan cusack ) , his cowgirl sidekick , the wise old prospector ( kelsey grammer ) , and bullseye , his trusty horse .  they have all been anxiously awaiting woody's arrival , as once their set is completed , they will be sold to a japanese toy museum , and finally escape storage forever .  this means woody now faces a difficult choice .  with his friends coming to rescue him , does he go with them and spend a few more years with andy , or does he go to japan and be immortalized forever ?  as in the original film , "" toy story 2 "" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there .  reportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters .  the film is well worth seeing on the big screen .  the colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more "" human . ""  the animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable .  there are so many impressive sequences that i'd find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al' s toy barn , the store owned by woody's captor .  pixar's rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it .  the voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development .  tom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice .  it was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim .  all the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent .  several new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work .   "" toy story 2 "" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie .  woody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn't yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like .  the new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner .  it may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it's downright touching .  the script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it's a sequel .  the reason "" toy story 2 "" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original's success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters .  not this one .  we get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up .   "" toy story 2 "" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself .  there is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here .  the humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults .  there are funny asides to films such as "" star wars "" and "" jurassic park , "" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock 'em sock 'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts "" a bug's life "" and the 1997 short "" geri 's game . ""   ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody's broken arm . )  the action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better .   "" toy story 2 "" never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest .  the more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is .  it's rare to see a film like "" toy story 2 "" come along , because it's the kind of film that's almost impossible to dislike .  it's created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it's nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile .  it's a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing "" toy story 2 . "" it's the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original .

1|expectation rating : a bit worse than expected ( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull ) .  roger ebert gave it a four star review , and while he is a critic that uses the full scale , and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998 , he must have seen a better film .  i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it .  the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter .  the landscape is snowy and cold , and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner ( which also reminds me of fargo ( which i loathed ) ) .  one can almost sense the cold .  but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead , instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better .  this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots .  the movie also reminded me of affliction , as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father , and they see a chance for such a dream to come true .  this chance is uncovered in a snow covered field , where an airplane has crash landed .  in the plane three men find ? the american dream . . .  in a gym bag . ?  affliction too was set in a snowy landscape .  it really seems very simple .  just hold on to the money until spring , and if no one claims it , they'll be safe to spend it and their hope of experiencing the american dream can come true .  but the snow melts , and so might several of the character's hopes .  as in ? return to paradise ? , some of the characters are presented with a chance to do the right thing .  but doing the right thing might not result in a better result than something more selfish .  the movie's biggest strength is that it fact makes sense .  i have seen many movies based on books that just seem like selected scenes from the book visualized , eschewing anything remotely resembling a coherent story -- for example clear and present danger .  the biggest problem seems to over-familiarization with the story .  the writer perhaps feels that he doesn't have to present scenes that are clear to him , but the lack of which only baffles an audience which has not read the book .  this is definitely not the problem with a simple plan , even though the screenplay is by the book's author .  the movie is always clear on where it's going , and always makes sense .  i'm sue a lot was cut , but really i can't remember what .  even a minor scene involving a man complaining that he has paid for too much grains is included .  the man only comes in on mondays , but he claims that he has been charged for one purchase too many .  turns out . . .  well , see the movie .  one should be warned against seeing the trailer .  it reveals several scenes from the ending moments ( which yes , like in the book , it is a downer ) , several plot developments , and much of the beginning .  but much of this is not spelled directly out during the trailer , so if you're lucky , you'll have forgotten about all of this when you see the movie .  |-0.16666666666666666|0.7666666666666666|0.7999999999999999|The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly negative, as the middle part of the film is found dull and is compared unfavorably to other movies. However, there are mentions of the movie being clear and coherent, which slightly balances the negative sentiment.
