0|"a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i've ever reviewed on paper .  i didn't know at the time that i'd soon encounter and despise batman & robin , which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer .  as directed by joel schumacher ( who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and isn't very good at either ) , b & r is one long excuse for a taco bell promotion .  the plot , which has mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) planning to take over gotham city and then "" the vorld "" ( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states ) , is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust , partnership , blah , blah , blah .  but morals are not the point of this film--topping each bloated , confusing action scene with next one is .  the garish art direction and overlit cinematography make this picture oddly comparable to the trashy showgirls .  since when did gotham city become a giant las vegas hotel ?  only george clooney comes out on top ; he underplays nicely and pretends like he's in a real movie .

""  call it whatever you want , but certainly don't see it unless you're in desperate need of a bad movie-induced chuckle -- "" hush "" scores so many unintentional guffaws that it almost qualifies as a guilty pleasure .  chalk its losses up to frequent stupidity lapses and apparent post-production tinkering ( it was supposed to open about a year ago ) , the latter of which appears to have given "" hush "" a send-off that's downright infuriating .  it's too bad that "" hush "" is so laughable , because the on-screen talent -- including the pairing of gwyneth paltrow and jessica lange -- is nothing to laugh at .  paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson , a photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy , well-to-do family's horse farm/estate kilronan .  jackson's mother martha ( lange ) runs kilronan all by herself , and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately -- even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether , caught red-handed after a bedroom romp with her husband-to-be .  but it seems that martha's friendly smile masks a much more threatening demeanor ; she's what you'd call someone who loves too much .  martha eagerly , deviously wants a grandchild , and then helen will be expendable , as far as she's concerned .  if there's one reason to catch "" hush , "" it's lange .  she treats the pedestrian screenplay better than it deserves to be treated , injecting martha ( poorly written though she may be ) with a little empathy to level out the psycho-playing field .  when she delves into martha's dark side , predictable cliches -- chain-smoking , staring in mirrors , praying in a confessional to a priest who isn't there , poking a hole in helen's diaphragm so she'll become pregnant ( and she does ) -- abound , but it's moderately entertaining junk because lange is such an interesting actress to watch .  veteran performer nina foch is smart and tart as jackson's wheelchair-bound paternal grandmother .  the rest of the cast looks ill and uncomfortable , especially paltrow .  but can you really blame them ?  the character relationships in "" hush "" hold a certain amount of promise , at least until their psychological impact is blown out of the water by sheer stupidity .  idiotic situations ( martha yells at a nearby horse so it will bolt up and knock helen over ) compliment idiotic dialogue ( "" why did you yell ? ""  helen yells back at martha ) , and the film takes the form of one of the shoddier fill in the blank-from-hell flicks ever made .  you can see through a great deal of martha's actions and lies from their conception ; why do people who have known this woman for years longer than we have never figure things out ?  does nobody communicate or read the newspaper in this town ?  if any of her potential victims thought , acted or behaved like normal people , "" hush "" would be a really short movie .  and then there's the climax and ending , which abruptly come when helen starts having contractions after eating some pound cake spiked with a labor-inducing drug normally used on horses .  after a really weird chase scene , martha calmly knits in a rocking chair while forcing helen to give birth in a bed all by herself .  i won't spoil what happens next except to say that it's contradictory , illogical and ( probably , since i'm no doctor ) medically impossible .  the final scene offers no closure , no resolution , no confrontation whatsoever .  it's just there , dangling amidst silent displeasure .  no one should like this ending , regardless of their feelings on the preceding material .  perhaps "" hush "" 's title is a plea to silence its audience's likely bitter word of mouth while exiting the theater .

0|"i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard .  the problem is , i can't remember them as i write this review .  that's not a good sign .  in booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can't really describe , because i don't know that much about him .  i only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn't like relationships , just "" booty calls "" at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) .  bunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz's direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! ) .  rushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it's going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki's friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met .  to make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki's obsession with safe sex .  first she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them .  oh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin .  back to the store .  now they've got to get dental dams , or there'll be no foreplay .  why are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ?  nikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she'd better be making these demands , too .  talk about coitus interruptus .  booty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies .  the difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality .  in this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane !  at the extreme .  there are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention .  it is disappointing , and even worse , distracting .  there are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? )  does not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing .  for instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant .  bunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone's surprise .  however , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery .  this negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene .  if , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , "" kung-fu movies , "" and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective .  this is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable .  by explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit .  the inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions .  why are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ?  why do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ?  if nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn't she have some condoms at her own apartment ?  these questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward .  a very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language .  some movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character's pattern of speech .  other films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves .  booty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn't work .  they stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them .  half of the scenes seem to occur for no reason .  the chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler .  this is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long .  it's too bad that the core of the film isn't much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog .  i refer you to the first paragraph of this review .

0|retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year .  earlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs .  and now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies .  starring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend .  besson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience .  at first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber .  after seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb .  with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making .  a timeless epic it is not .  besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands .  on the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery .  there is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) .  jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective .  jovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard .  she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast .  jovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost .  quite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble .  the script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions .  faye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience' .  all three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful .  the battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart' .  there's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier .  even his fellow troopers are petrified .  `the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story .  almost too 90's , it seems .  there's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! '  sprinkled throughout the screenplay .  i was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened .  there's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly .  it seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does .  the musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive .  if it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal .  but the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake .  during these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning .  it's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects .  `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf .  anyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film .  despite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy .  |-0.7333333333333334|0.9|0.3333333333333333|"The text summarizes that the film ""The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc"" is negatively criticized for being disjointed, overblown, and poorly executed, with disappointing performances and laughable dialogue, but it is praised for its musical score and production designs."

( yakuza translated for the average american is the japanese mafia . )  if you piss a "" family "" member off , or dishonor yourself in any way , the usual punishment is public display of self-mutilation , usually resulting in the loss of limbs .  a definition of dishonor can be anything from making a stupid decision to leaving one family for another .  it would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from .  unfortunately the film doesn't give too much of an explanation , assuming its audience is aware of kitano's earlier work .  there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members , leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something , but you never know what .  then there's a scene in which a man kills himself in front of a rival in exchange for that rival joining the family .  granted , this is one of the best scenes in the movie , but it doesn't make a lot of sense .  instead , the two hours are basically spent watching the following : people go out and shoot each other , talk about it for ten-plus minutes , then go out and do it again .  the consistently repetitive discussion of territory during these moments involuntarily provokes yawning .  there are also plot details thrown in for no identifiable purpose .  all of the sudden yamamoto ( kitano ) has a girlfriend .  he barely speaks to her , treats her like crap , and then sends her away .  another missed opportunity , considering it is such a big deal for kitano to bring his magic to the united states , is the combination of cultures , which rely too heavily on overused stereotypes .  though slow moving , brother does have good elements .  the action scenes are well directed , clearly defined , and interesting to watch .  some of the violence is more hinted at than shown , which produces the luscious squirm that one goes to see such films for .  the actors would be more enticing if they had more to do .  shirase's ( masaya kato ) loud , sarcastic coolness set against yamamoto's quietly threatening attitude is truly an entertaining combination .  their moments together or apart steal the rest of the show .  also to its credit , brother tackles the cause and effect of crime with realism .  a life of crime is easy to get sucked into with the first reward of quick cash .  sure people get rich , but they can also lose just as easily .  it's a great moral , with a great cast , just not much substance to back it up .

""  --- dr . alexander mccabe ( bob gunton ) , in response to why he created evil bats .  alright folks , stop me if you've heard this one : genetically altered animals wreak havoc on a town and a small band of locals , assisted by a specialist in the particular animal's field , must team up to stop the mutant creatures before they can multiply and spread across the earth .  oh yeah , the military is on their way to bomb the town as well , so they are running short on time .  sound familiar ?  such is the plot of the destination films release of bats .  dina meyer stars as the "" bat specialist "" sheila , who is pulled from her research ( along with her annoying sidekick , played with irritating deftness by leon ) in order to help a small texas town figure out why some local citizens and animals have been chewed to death recently .  with the help of the local sheriff ( lou diamond phillips ) , a cdc official ( carlos jacott ) , and a scientist ( bob gunton ) , sheila discovers it is indeed bats ( who have been genetically altered by gunton's character to be more aggressive and omnivorous , in order to be used as a military weapon ! ) .  i have to say here that i knew exactly what i was getting into going into this film .  there's not a frame of promotional footage i have seen for the film that would have led me to believe it was going to be any good .  in this respect , the film never disappointed me .  this film reaches a level that transcends the "" so bad it's good "" level and borders on the downright insane .  the effects are awful , the script is contrived , and for most of the feature i was laughing at things that were supposed to be taken seriously ( i think ) .  i challenge anyone to sit through the scene , where a bat stalks a baby in a crib while another bat terrorizes a patron eating at a diner , with a straight face .  thankfully , the performances are as good as they can be considering the material the actors had to perform with .  dina meyer has always been the highlight of any of the films she has been in ( johnny mnemonic , dragonheart , and starship troopers . . .  the latter being the only film out of that batch with any actual merit ) , and this one is no exception .  while one never really gets the impression that meyer's character could be a bat expert in reality , one never really cares to doubt it either .  she gives as good a performance as could be expected , plus she's nice to look at for an hour and a half .  lou diamond phillips is also serviceable here , as the small town sheriff turned eventual hero .  although when we first meet his character he knows bats are the reason for what's going on in town , for some reason later on he suddenly becomes amazed to learn that the actual cause of the deaths in town are because of bats .  the only bad performance in the film is that of leon's .  he is relegated to the "" i'm not sticking around here ! ""  character and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays .  anyone who can't immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it .  even if he hadn't been the villain in just about every film he's ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever .  in fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale .  if the plot doesn't sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol .  an entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor's orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk .  a government official blows off shelia's instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit .  a cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it .  finally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it's single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we're lucky to even get kevin smith's dogma ) .  the most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets .  while the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what's going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key .  therefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film .  being able to see the puppeteer's arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse .  after all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don't say you haven't been warned .  trust me when i say that it's a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through .  i just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in .  she's definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these .

0|warner brothers ; rated pg-13 ( mild violence , sexual situations ) ; 132 minutes  director : luis mandoki  screenplay : gerald di pego ( from the novel by nicholas sparks )  cast : kevin costner , robin wright-penn , paul newman , illeana douglas , robbie coltrane , jesse james , john savage .  review by : geoff berkshire  i'm not an overly cynical guy .  there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years .  however , i have my limits and i also have standards .  this brings us to the subject at hand : message in a bottle , the big ticket romance that warner brothers' unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine's day .  the story , what little of it that there is , involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne ( robin wright-penn ) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason ( jesse james ) .  during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean .  the letter , written to a mystery woman named catherine , instantly captivates her .  upon her return , theresa shares it with her best friend lina ( illeana douglas ) , her boss charlie ( robbie coltrane ) , and the entire city of chicago ( the newspaper publishes an article about it ) .  it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake ( kevin costner ) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down .  he turns out to have a colorful father ( paul newman ) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing .  this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship .  of course she doesn't tell him that she found his letter , she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later ( preferably right after they first make love ) .  this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened .  the discovery of the message and garret's discovery that theresa discovered the message are really the only two noteworthy events that happen during the nearly two and a quarter hour running time of this film .  there's a truly lame subplot about garret's relationship with his dead wife's family ( he gets into a bar fight with her brother , played by john savage ) and then the necessary tear-jerking ending .  a fun way to pass the time is to take bets on exactly who will die , although it becomes pretty clear by the second reel .  the actual death sequence is one of the most ridiculously forced , and unintentionally humorous , sequences filmed since . . .  well , since costner's the postman ( 1997 ) .  message in a bottle is one slow moving film .  last year audiences were offered endurance tests such as the horse whisperer and meet joe black but both of those films resemble jerry bruckheimer productions next to this .  they also had redeeming qualities in the form of quality performances and some stand out technical work .  message in a bottle has a decent enough cast but they're fighting the material all the way , and losing badly .  costner and , especially , wright-penn are both likable and attractive enough to cheer for but their characters are simply too boring .  they also fail to generate any kind of real romantic chemistry .  the supporting players are given very little to do .  the reliable douglas is particularly wasted .  old pro newman gives his all and occasionally threatens to kick some life into this dead horse of a film .  a confrontational scene he has with costner near the end is especially well played .  however , too frequently he just reminds us how unexciting our lead characters are .  the film is very polished on the technical side to be sure but it only works to undercut the story .  gabriel yared , who previously set the romantic moods of the english patient ( 1996 ) and city of angels ( 1998 ) with his scores , overdoes it a bit here .  caleb deschanel's camera makes everything look a little too beautiful .  do the offices of the chicago tribune really need to look heavenly ?  the editing by steven weisberg is troubling not only considering all that could have been cut out but is also simply messy at times .  the real offender here is screenwriter gerald di pego .  working from a best- selling novel by nicholas sparks ( which i have not read but have been told is on the same literary level as the bridges of madison county ) , di pego creates one of the most uninspired scripts of recent times .  its strict adherence to clich ? s brings to mind such disasters as i still know what you did last summer ( 1998 ) .  there simply isn't an original scene in this film .  the dialogue is rarely better than laughable and this is only accentuated by the excessively long pauses every character takes while speaking .  this is director mandoki's first film since when a man loves a woman ( 1994 ) , the solid meg ryan/andy garcia romance .  he's simply going through the motions with this .  message in a bottle is easily the worst of the several romantic offerings available in theaters at the moment and vies with what dreams may come ( 1998 ) as one of the most misguided romances of the decade .  |-0.5166666666666667|0.8333333333333334|0.8500000000000001|"The reviewers all have a negative sentiment towards the movie ""Message in a Bottle,"" criticizing its slow pace, uninspired script, lack of chemistry between the lead characters, wasted supporting actors, and comparing it to other failed romantic movies, ultimately calling it one of the worst romantic offerings of the decade."
0|disconnect the phone line .  don't accept the charges .  do anything you can to avoid the wretched , melodramatic sisterhood dramedy `hanging up' .  i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side , and `hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so .  the film features an incredible palate of female talent , and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as `sleepless in seattle' and `unsung heroes' .  meg ryan , diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who , once separated by career judgments over family ties , must reunite when their father ( walter matthau ) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer's disease .  while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past , the script by sisters delia and nora ephron is exasperating , shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery .  `hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele-marketer pestering you for two hours , while you don't have the option of doing as the title suggests .  for the first half-hour , the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development .  this is an annoying and ineffective device .  cell-phones ring every five minutes , and everyone hurriedly rushes along , leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems .  if `hanging up' was an apple pie , then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story .  granted , there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film .  but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck .  the most outrageous strategy in `hanging up' is that , after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development , we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale .  we are able to identify with eve ( ryan ) , the most open and caring daughter , because she is the one who stayed by her father's side as everyone else moved forward to pursue a impending career .  georgia ( keaton ) , the eldest daughter , is celebrating the fifth year anniversary of her magazine called . . . .  `georgia' .  maddy ( kudrow ) , the soap opera actress , spends time either contemplating her possible path to stardom or nursing her dog .  ryan's convincing performance and diverting cuteness are two of the more agreeable aspects of `hanging up' .  kudrow , so delightfully eccentric as the off-kilter airhead phoebe in `friends' , is totally wasted .  ditto for keaton , who is serving a double shift as co-star and director - a time slot that can be a difficult priority juggle .  her frenzy is apparent .  for a chick flick , there is a distressing lack of chuckles .  the reliable matthau is reduced to chaotic shtick that , given his character's situation , seems more depressing than amusing .  even so , the peak form of humor in `hanging up' is represented by some of matthau's nasty quips and ryan's eternal battle to have the aforementioned pooch swallow a pill .  that about accounts for the three or four chuckles you will expel during the film .  my curiosity has suddenly been tweaked to discover how such a promising and star-studded approach could turn so viciously sour .  but really , it's no mystery .  the predictable , melodramatic filth that is `hanging up' is certainly not the fault of these actresses .  pin it on the screenplay , which attempts to clear up vital issues in three or four minutes , while spending the rest of the running time in an annoying flurry of phone conversations .  it's certainly a far cry from what one would label as a rewarding experience , but `hanging up' should have at least been enjoyable .  uh-uh .  it's a wrong number from the beginning .  |-0.65|0.8666666666666667|0.9333333333333332|"The sentiment of the explanations is consistently negative, with the reviewers expressing strong dislike for the movie ""Hanging Up"" due to its poor script, lack of character development, humor, and overall predictability."

0|i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series .  if there's a will , there's a way ; and i believe that anything , no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon .  this is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sant's universally panned update of psycho ; i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience , but also very on-par with an original .  but i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad .  you see , the point of a remake is , or at least it should be , to iron out the original's flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection .  but what if the source material on which the remake is based isn't any good to begin with ?  that is the only cinematic question pondered by the bland actioner the mod squad .  i've only seen a couple episodes of the late 60s tv series on which it is based , and to be honest , i didn't like it all that much .  it has a concept that -- and still is -- interesting ; a group of corrupt young adults , all in their early 20s are given a choice : they either go to jail for the various crimes that they all have committed , or they can become undercover cops , helping the police get into places that they normally wouldn't be able to access .  obviously , all 3 opt for the latter option and become undercover policemen ( and policewomen ) .  the three main characters here are played by claire danes , omar epps and giovanni ribisi .  of the three , only danes has a real character .  ribisi's dumbass 20 year old is played exclusively for laughs ; epps' slightly more intelligent one is used to create various chase scenes .  when the squad's superviser gets killed off and his reputation dirtied in death , the three of them , sure that their beloved master was framed , go off and investigate on their own , discovering corrupt cops , lots and lots of expensive whores and very lucrative drug operations .  all kinds of good stuff !  the only times that the mod squad comes even close to working is in its comedic moments .  although ribisi is a trite actor and his characters repeat movie after movie , his man here is really rather amusing , when the script gives him a chance .  epps' straight man is effectively played against ribisi's clueless spontaneity .  but the rest of the film is dull , boring and singularly uninteresting .  a drug-op action plot is no longer anything new , not even with teenage action heroes , and the way it's executed here , it's also nowhere near exciting or suspenseful .  claire danes' character has potential , but it is buried under heaps of cliches and her performance is too restrained .  she could have been a tour-de-force , but instead director scott silver puts shackles on her and simply does not allow her to do anything really significant with her role .  epps and ribisi fare slightly better and do as well as can be expected , although their characters aren't nearly as rich as danes' could have been .  the mod squad is a mind-numbing marketing plot of a film , and teens will jump all over it .  it's full of bad dialogue , scenes and concepts that make no sense and -- get this -- drug dealers that like to tango with other guys in their spare time .  nothing is remotely intriguing or worth paying for .  claire danes is no longer alluring -- mainly because she's got a horrible hairdo , so that draw is out .  there are , however , cool explosions , guns and chases which may lure a viewer into thinking that he or she is about to experience an exciting thriller of some sort .  do not be fooled .  some may call this escapist fare -- i call it escape-as-quickly-as-you-can fare .  |-0.5666666666666668|0.9333333333333332|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is negative, as the author expresses disappointment and disapproval towards remakes, specifically ""The Mod Squad.""

0|"it's almost amusing to watch 21-year old christina ricci get drastically overshadowed in sally potter's follow-up to 1997's the tango lesson , the man who cried .  the gen-y actress , with her cold stare and big , black eyes , has appeared in an impressive range of films ; but she doesn't even come close to being the bold heroine the film , set against the historical backdrop of world war 2 , requires her to be .  ricci , whose character is shockingly silent and blank , showing only the occasional smile or hint of concern , shares most of her scenes with the astounding cate blanchett : quite an amusing sight to behold .  blanchett's lola , a paris dwelling dancer who befriends the aspiring singer suzie , is bold , interesting and layered ? everything our heroine lacks .  co-star of the upcoming lord of the rings trilogy , blanchett has a good seven inches on ricci , sports twice the makeup and dons a flashy wardrobe .  the actress inhabits the role ? as she always so remarkably does ? with a fervor and life that makes you want her to hold the screen as the film's lead rather than her dull companion .  important historical events involving hitler and his nazis scatter themselves across the film ; these landmarks serve as the film's little conflict .  obviously , the tables are turned in the life of suzie by these events , whose jewish origin is unknown among her parisian colleagues .  the man who cried has many aspirations , none of which come full circle by the film's close .  there are forced messages here and there : "" go forward ; always go forward , "" lola preaches to suzie ; there's romance between suzie and a fellow target of hitler's nazis , the gypsy cesar ( johnny depp , who , like ricci , barely gets to speak ) ; lola struggles with her character that desires above all things wealth and men who have it ; and at the core of all these devices lies suzie's desire to travel to america , where her father journeyed after leaving her and her mother years ago .  the film's main problem is that potter isn't skilled enough to tell the epic-sized story of suzie .  the time period's instability , the conflicting social classes , the prejudice against suzie from all those around her in her new life : serving as both writer and director , potter throws in some of each , but hardly an inch of depth is to be found in any .  by the time the sigh-inducing climax hits , the believability and complete absence of focus leave one ready to leave the theater .  the film's falling action is weirdly unsatisfying and unlikely ; are we really meant to believe any of this could happen ?  contrastingly , in its moving final scene , the man who cried strikes a note that is made effective in its ties to the emotional beginning of the film .  although it's apparent that potter can't grasp what she reaches , i'm puzzled as to why she reaches for so much in the first place .  ricci's suzie is meant to be the film's core : from the extended flashback at the film's beginning to the quickly drawn ending , everything seen in the film , in some way , relates to her .  so why then does potter spend so much time on subplots involving other individuals ?  the character of suzie is too present for the man who cried to work as an ensemble , but not present enough for the film to be ricci's .  the almost constant lack of flow and one-note tone with which potter depicts the man who cried are somewhat improved upon by sacha vierny's beautiful cinematography that renders the film's various locations wonderfully .  also worthy of note are lindy hemming's costumes that help to depict the area quite nicely .  and then there's the music .  from minute one to minute ninety-seven , there's hardly a moment when the wavering , skilled voice of an opera singer or the rhythms of the gypsy music don't undercut the action ; the notes stricken both overwhelm ( particularly john turturro , portraying fictional opera singer dante dominio , whose money and reputation catch lola's interest ) and accompany ( oftentimes , the perfect chords are captured to undermine the state of the film's characters and reinforce that state ) .  potter obviously cares much about each and every musical note ; unfortunately , the same effort isn't given towards ( almost ) everything else .
