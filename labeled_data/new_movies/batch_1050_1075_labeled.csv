0|"my giant is two movies for the price of one , but neither is worth the cost of admission , even if you get in free .  as lamely directed by michael lehmann , the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book .   ( "" without goliath , david is just some punk throwing rocks . "" )  languidly paced throughout , the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious as the screenplay by david seltzer ( the omen ) meanders toward its sad ending .  since it's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic , what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery .  other than a few nice visuals , there's nothing to recommend the picture .  with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally ? to the original city slickers , billy crystal has shown that he's more than the world's best oscar host .  he does , however , have a propensity for choosing hopeless material as in last year's father's day and this year's my giant .  one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project .  surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there .  perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success .  or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie's somber tone .  the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget they saw it by the next day .  this one-joke movie's single idea is to place real-life basketball player gheorghe muresan , who stands seven and a half feet tall , into as many visually striking situations as possible .  sammy ( crystal ) , an agent currently without clients , is rescued after a car accident by a sweet romanian giant named max ( muresan ) .  after throwing out constant one-liners ( "" either god is in the salvage business or big foot just took my car . "" ) ,  sammy decides to get serious , seeing max as his meal ticket .  and although he doesn't like it , he's willing to sign max up to do disgusting events like a wrestling match with a half-dozen dwarfs .   ( the movie itself knows no bounds as it contains one of the most putrid and lengthy vomiting scenes ever . )  after a series of missed opportunities , the comedic part of the movie is over , and it turns into a cheap and maudlin disease movie .  we learn that max's condition is terminal , and he will soon die .  to be fair , the movie does contain a few good scenes - all of which you can see in the trailers .  let's hope billy gets himself a pair of reading glasses before he signs up for another movie .  my giant runs too long even at just 1 : 37 .  it is rated pg for violence and profanity and would be acceptable for kids around ten and up .  my son jeffrey and his friend matthew , both 9 , gave the movie a single star and had nothing good to say about it .  matthew pointed out that it "" is not as good as it could have been or should have been .

0|"talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters !  spice world is the feature film debut of the pre-fabricated pop band , the spice girls .  it's intended as a sort of hard day's night , but ends up simply hard to watch .  when watching the spice girls , i'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick ( such as from the smurfs , the snorks , or teenage mutant ninja turtles ) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name .  the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles , and about as talented .  there's ginger ( geri halliwell ) , the brainy one , sporty ( melanie chisholm ) , the athletic one , baby ( emma bunton ) , the childish one , posh ( victoria adams ) , the fashion-conscious one , and scary ( melanie brown ) , the one with a tongue pierced back so far you're almost certain the post sticks out her throat .  the film itself doesn't really have a plot .  it follows the girls as they travel here and there , culminating at their "" first live performance "" at albert hall .  the action , however , seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas .  the various misfires include : an alien encounter , a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls , the shooting of a spice girls documentary , a movie producer ( george wendt ) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie ( nearly all of which , though incredibly far fetched , seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up ) , a meeting with a pregnant friend ( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends ) , a boating adventure , a bus race , club-hopping ( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd . . . even  when they start to sing ) , and an assorted number of musical performances , press conferences , and general all-around celebrity stuff .  whew .  for some reason , the film is littered with star cameos .  from elton john to elvis costello , from bob hoskins to meat loaf .  heck , even roger moore shows up , though he can't decide if he's parodying himself as james bond , or if he's lobbying to be the reincarnation of ernst stavro blofeld .  richard e . grant has the largest secondary part , a thankless role of the band's manager , clifford .  the celebrity spotting is partially amusing , and a decent way to pass the time when confronted with the rest of the film .  neither amusing or spontaneous , when the spice girls are between songs they are deadly boring .  their songs are alright , but they play like lifeless adaptations of the music videos .  my advice to fans is : stay home and watch that video collection , or at least spin that cd a couple of more times . . . either  option will be more enjoyable than the film .  non-fans should know to stay well away from this one .

0|this feature is like a double header , two sets of clich ? s for the price of one .  not only do we get the usual tired sports chestnuts , but the banal rich girl-poor boy love story is tossed in for good measure .  an original moment in this loser is as rare as a chicago cubs world series appearance .  the screenplay by kevin falls and john gatins , based on a story by falls , merely lobs its plotline at the audience .  this is a story that needed sent down for seasoning and more coaching .  summer catch centers around ryan dunne ( freddie prinze jr . ) , a cape cod youth chosen to participate in the prestigious cape cod baseball league , supposedly a showcase for the best young amateur and college players in the country .  ryan is a blue-collar kind of guy .  he works with his dad taking care of the lawns of cape cod's rich and famous .  he also , as we are informed early , his own worst enemy .  he has the potential and the talent , but always seems to self-destruct at the crucial moment .  so , ryan tries to remained focused on baseball .  then he meets tenley parrish ( jessica biel ) , daughter of one of the blue bloods whose lawn he manicures .  tenley , a name only a hack screenwriter could invent , is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan .  if you can't figure out where all this nonsense leads , then you need a remedial course in film viewing .  as always prinze is pretty to look at , but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions : puppy dog love , heartbreak , frustration , self-loathing or determination .  biel cries a lot , while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class-conscious father .  the only beacon is matthew lillard's fun-loving billy brubaker , the team's catcher .  summer catch borrows situations and stylings from other baseball movies , such as bull durham and the natural .  no curve balls here , no sliders .  every pitch is predictable .  a blind umpire could call this movie .  summer catch is strictly rookie league moviemaking .  it has as much chance of making the movie hall of fame as the dodgers have of moving back to brooklyn .  |-0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|0.9|"The sentiment of the explanations is consistently negative, as they criticize the movie ""Summer Catch"" for being full of clich√©s, lacking originality, and having little chance of success.

0|"one of the responses those that enjoy "" detroit rock city "" ( probably kiss fans , mostly ) might have upon first glance at the rating i've given the film might be something like : "" oh , that casey's gone and become a jaded critic on us .  just what did he expect out of a dumb teenage rock n' roll movie like this ? ""  i'm wondering the same thing .  i feel like i should have had a grand time with "" detroit rock city . ""  it's the sort of movie i wish i could've had a lot of fun with , but i didn't .  i just didn't .  surely this film isn't trying to win any major awards , so should i have expected an oscar-caliber film ?  no , but i expected something .  a funny joke .  a clever prank .  a plot development .  anything .  the movie never delivers .  you've got to marvel at how the filmmakers managed to come up with a movie that is truly about nothing .   "" detroit rock city "" is one of those films that you walk out of after the credits have rolled and realize that you just spent 90 minutes watching a movie in which absolutely nothing happened to justify the film's existence , and it's not a very satisfying realization .  the film is about four teenage boys , all huge kiss fans from cleveland , trying to get into a kiss concert in detroit , michigan .  that's it .  there is no big plot description in this review , because the movie has very little plot .  the characters are hawk ( edward furlong ) , lex ( giuseppe andrews ) , trip ( james debello ) , and jam ( sam huntington ) .  they have a garage band .  they're pathetic , like all garage bands , but they like kiss and they like rock n' roll , so i guess that means we root for them .  they have tickets , they lose them .  they get more tickets , they lose those too .  they come up with crazy schemes to get tickets , most of which backfire .  there's not much more to it .  frankly , it becomes a little less than exciting to see them try to get kiss tickets about halfway through the film , when a total of eight tickets have already graced the boys' hands , only to be lost because of their sheer stupidity .  oh , and jam ( real name jeremiah ) has a really , really annoying ultra-religious mother who ought to be reported to the child welfare agency .  she doesn't want them to see kiss , if you hadn't figured that out already .  it's really quite disheartening to see such a fine soundtrack go to waste in a pointless movie like this .  we've got plenty of kiss , along with some ac/dc , ramones , and thin lizzy .  then again , "" maximum overdrive "" had an awesome soundtrack ( me being the big ac/dc fan that i am ) , but is probably one of the worst movies of all time .   "" detroit rock city "" doesn't quite reach that level of ineptitude , but it gets dangerously close .  in fact , the music is the only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete failure in my mind .  basically , the soundtrack has earned the film a full half-star , which means all the bands involved can pat themselves on the back ( except for marilyn manson , whose half-hearted cover of ac/dc's "" highway to hell "" sounds like something my neighbor's cat coughed up ) .  it's also really sad to see the talents of the cast go to waste , because it' s evident that they're all trying really hard to squeeze some life out of this dead turkey of a movie .  edward furlong has done far better work than this , and so has natasha lyonne , and so has lin shaye , but hey , they've got to make a living in hollywood .  people wanting to see kiss , and lots of it will probably be disappointed , considering the band appears for about five minutes and plays one song .  too bad , they might have provided some energy to this mess .  director adam rifkin knows he hasn't got much material to work with , so he takes a chapter from the michael bay book of directing and keeps his camera spinning .  we get an endless parade of quick-cuts , split-screens , zoom-outs , zoom-ins , and rotating cameras , all in an effort to cover up the sheer stupidity of the script .  it's fun for a while , but eventually it becomes disorienting .  i would recommend that those who felt seasick at "" the blair witch project "" stay far away from "" detroit rock city , "" because the witch has got nothing on this baby .  i haven't felt such an urge to reach out and hold the camera still since "" armageddon . ""  and what about that script ?  it's written by carl j . dupr ? , which sounds like as made-up a name as i've ever heard .  if it is , i can't say i blame the writer for distancing himself as far from this script as possible .  a plotless , pointless rock n' roll movie can be fun , if the jokes and gags are actually funny .  the jokes in "" detroit rock city "" rarely are .  in fact , the only time i really laughed was when a priest gets stoned on a marijuana-laced pizza , and that was just because it was so surreal .  the rest of the movie just seems like they just threw a bunch of vulgar stuff up on screen and called it "" comedy . ""  there is no set-up , just a succession of punchlines that don't provide for much in the way of chuckles , precisely because there was no set-up .  it's as if they just whacked someone on the head , pointed at him and said , "" see ?  funny ! ""  look , that woman was so shocked by hearing loud kiss music that she spilled her drink .  see ?  funny !  look , that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver .  twice .  see ?  funny !  look , that kid has been vomiting for 20 minutes after drinking an inordinate amount of alcohol and is now about to perform an exotic dance for money .  see ?  funny !  a word of advice to mr . dupr ? : no , these things aren't funny all by themselves .  they must be preceded by a clever set-up so the audience hasn 't predicted them five minutes in advance .  that's it , i've said enough about this movie .  it's a waste of time and money .  i liked the music , but don't bother buying the soundtrack .  i hear it' s just modern bands doing inferior versions of the songs that are actually in the movie .  you want to see this concept executed well ?  go rent roger corman's 1979 classic "" rock n' roll high school . ""  it features another late-seventies rock band ( the ramones ) and a far more interesting story about a girl trying to get tickets to their show .  yes , go rent that , and skip "" detroit rock city , "" which will probably bomb , and deservedly so .

0|"funny how your expectations can be defeated , and not in good ways .  the ghost and the darkness promised ( at least , it seemed to me to promise ) a hemingwayesque showdown between men and nature .  what it delivered was mystery science theater 3000-level material -- an inadvertently hilarious story that made me scream advice at the characters .

""  of course it is perfectly true that in many places in that region armed conflicts have turned life into a living hell .  a guerrilla war is always bad for civilians .  but the film talks down to the viewer .  dr . fuentes ( played by federico luppi ) teaches medicine in the capital city of his country .  he has , as a great humanitarian gesture , trained and inspired some of his best students to go into the mountains and make the world a little better for the poor indios .  fuentes believe the students to be up there doing humanitarian service .  then he discovers one of his best students has instead returned to the city and runs a squalid private pharmacy .  in shame and disappointment fuentes asks the student what has happened to the others .  the student tells him the others are still in the mountains , but suggests that it may not be a good place to be .  fuentes goes off to find and visit the doctors , ignoring the advice of his family and a patient who happens to be an army general .  the results are little different than one would expect .  dr . fuentes starts out incredibly naive .  even some american tourists , present in the film mostly for comic relief , seem to know better than dr . fuentes that things have gotten pretty bad in the mountains .  but fuentes has to go from one scene of barbarity to another and discover how wrong he was .  sayles certainly could have used 126 minute of screen time to tell us something more profound than that nasty things are happening down there and most of the worst happens to the unarmed civilians .  the cast is mostly unknowns to american audiences .  federico luppi is the good mexican actor who played the antique dealer torn by mysterious forces in cronos .  damian delgado makes a late appearance as an army deserter .  mandy patinkin has a small role made to look bigger in the trailer .

0|there are two things the american film industry should avoid at all costs .  one is letting an ambitious actor convert one of his or her favorite novels into a feature film .  two is never greenlight a sci-fi film starring john travolta .  to wit , we present the disaster that is battlefield earth .  a science-fiction opus starring the barbarino of the actors guild , battlefield earth should be shown only at maximum-security prisons when a prisoner is tossed in solitary for bad behavior .  sci-fi is always a tricky beast : tight script , a good director , an ensemble cast of decent actors , and the ability to suspend even the most difficult of disbeliefs .  battlefield earth fails at achieving even one of these attributes .  here's the `plot . '  the year is 3000 .  mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos ( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group ) .  a small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the `demons' who dwell in the cities below .  the psychlos are strip-mining the earth for its resources and terel , played by travolta , is the head of security for the mining/slave base located in denver .  a young rogue named jonnie goodboy tyler , played with dramatic flair by barry pepper , ventures from the safety of the caves into the city to uncover the truth about the `demons . '  he is promptly captured and taken to the alien base .  after several attempts at escape , johnnie is placed in the middle of an underhanded subplot of terel's , involving circumventing gold from an exposed vein in the rockies to his own end .  jonnie , assumed leader of the mining slave group , then manages to attain all psychlo and human intelligence through a learning machine terel forces him to use .  then the story just runs along until jonnie teaches the rest of the humans the basics of trigonometry , the bill of rights , how to use a machine gun , and how to fly a harrier jet .  the whole mess concludes with a big , loud , obnoxious gun-and-plane battle that had me praying for the end credits .  roger christian , the director of this lumbering beast , must have rented dune , blade runner , planet of the apes , independence day , stargate , beastmaster , the airwolf episodes , the `v' miniseries , the matrix , and the omega man . . .  and decided to steal every scene he could for battlefield earth .  christian even shoots every scene in a weird dutch angle titled left or right for every frame of the movie !  and every scene in the movie ends with a middle wipe -- really .  the psychlos reminded me of a cross between jamaican basketball players with bad teeth and bloated hands and klingon extras working the star trek convention circuit .  travolta's acting hasn't been this bad since the experts or maybe perfect .  jonnie goodboy tyler evolves into william wallace with lines like `you can have your freedom if you fight ! '  then there's the script : the film just never convinces you that the plight of jonnie in teaching his fellow humans to fight and `take back the planet' would be a difficult task to achieve .  why ?  because terel provides all the necessary tools to incite a revolt -- for no particular reason beside the fact that `humans are stupid . '  terel may be right , you know .  humans made this movie .  |-0.8333333333333334|0.8833333333333333|0.8000000000000002|"The sentiments expressed in the explanations are highly negative towards the American film industry and the film ""Battlefield Earth.""

0|would you believe -- in real life , i mean -- that if you were julia roberts , that you'd be the ugly underdog to your sister , the creepy catherine zeta-jones ?  let me tell you what reality is .  reality is that you are megastar julia fricking roberts and your brother is eric roberts , and he picks up whatever crumbs of stardom fall off your coattails as you blaze across the sky in a golden chariot .  that's reality .  america's sweethearts is the opposite of reality , a train wreck that tries to sell julia as a scruffy also-ran , presumably because she wears horn-rimmed glasses and used to be overweight ( uh-huh ) .  the plot follows two married , mega-movie stars , gwen and eddie ( zeta-jones and poor , poor john cusack , whose material gets worse every year ) , on the eve of their new star vehicle's release , a film called time over time .  the only problem : gwen and eddie have gone through a nasty separation , and the press and public have not been forgiving ( think meg and dennis ) .  gosh , and the director has vanished with the film , holding the only print hostage .  veteran pr agent lee ( billy crystal ) is called upon to clean up the mess , throwing a press junket in the nevada desert to woo them with the story of a possible reconciliation between the gwen and eddie , presumably distracting the stupid , stupid film critics into forgetting they haven't seen the movie at all .   ( note to sony : any studio executive that thinks this plot is going to win points with the reviewing press needs to check into rehab . )  and did i mention gwen's sister kiki ( roberts ) is along for the ride ?  and that she and eddie just might fall in love along the way ?  oh billy , you're a scamp !  the script you've co-written with peter tolan ( what planet are you from ?  and bedazzled -- need i say more ? ) is a roast of hollywood and celebrity , sure , but it's not a funny one .  yes , crystal tells us , hollywood is lying to our faces !  if you are surprised by this , you might want to check on your subscription to people magazine .  it's about to expire .  aside from a scant few zingers ( yeah , se ? or winces rules ! ) ,  america's sweethearts' jokes aren't funny , its pace is choppy , and the whole affair comes off as a vanity project -- not for headlining star julia roberts -- but for billy crystal to deliver a bunch of lame punch lines that he wrote himself .  i didn't time it ( the movie's not that bad ) , but it's crystal who really has the most screen time and is the unequivocal focus of the film .  bad move , billy -- your jokes suck .  the crotch humor is outpaced only by the meanness of the movie's gags -- and with unsubtle sexual innuendo dripping from every scene , how this movie earned a pg-13 rating is a mystery to me .  julia overcame a lot of spiteful writing and acting to make my best friend's wedding into a winning film , but not even that 90-tooth smile can save her here .  obviously aware of the ugliness before him , director joe roth turns to goofy supporting characters like hank azaria ( as a lisping spaniard ) , christopher walken ( the insane time over time director ) , and alan arkin ( a new age guru in a fright wig ) to crack wise .  none of the stereotypes is successful except for walken ; azaria comes off as a preening queen when he's supposed to be macho .  as for roth , in case you don't know , went from direcing revenge of the nerds ii to launching his own movie studio , revolution , which produced this work .  he's back behind the camera for the first time in 11 years .  it'll probably be another 11 before he's back again .  i could drone on about how america's sweethearts will only appeal to the mouth-breathing morons who talk on their cell phones during the movies , but that would get old .  instead , i'll settle for discussing the movie's worst sin : that sweethearts is painfully contrived and wholly unbelievable , not just in its plot but in its sentiment .  every single character in this film ( with the arguable exception of kiki ) is simply hateful , and putting them in a romantic comedy is a waste of a bunch of villains .  when you leave the theater , you'll ask yourself , too : why would i want any of these jerks to be happy ?  |-0.8333333333333334|0.8833333333333333|0.9333333333333332|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is highly negative, with the language being derogatory, critical, and sarcastic towards the movie ""America's Sweethearts"".

0|mr . nice guy is the latest jackie chan film , so you should know what to expect .  a weak plot , terrible dialogue , very little acting ability , but some jaw-dropping action sequences that nearly make the rest of it worthwhile .  however , mr . nice guy lacks the sparkle of jackie's best efforts , and its weaknesses are more glaring than ever .  jackie chan plays , who else , jackie .  this time out , he's a famous chef who hosts an australian cooking show .  not that it ever makes a difference in the plot .  there are only two scenes of him cooking .  for the rest of the film , somehow he mutates into jackie chan , supercop .  it never does explain why his character has such superb martial arts skills . . . perhaps he was in the same cooking class as steven seagal in under siege ?  a tv newswoman , diana ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) , covertly tapes a drug deal involving kingpin giancarlo ( richard norton ) and a local gang of toughs , the demons .  although she only has one camcorder , somehow the result is full of close-ups and multiple angles . . . hmmm ,  shades of broadcast news ? ? ?  anyway , the goons discover diana , and will do anything to recover the tape .  here lies another crucial flaw in the story : doesn't anyone realize you can copy a tape ?  oh well , no one ever said jackie chan movies had to make sense .  as luck would have it , diana runs across jackie , and , wouldn't you know it , jackie accidentally ends up with the tape .  this leads to countless chase and/or fight scenes which look like they could have been lifted from rumble in the bronx or nearly any other jackie chan movie .  in a move apparently designed to woo american ( and other english-speaking ) audiences , the film uses english as its primary language .  however , that doesn't mean an end to the atrocious dubbing that has afflicted jackie's recent americanized releases .  strangely , many of the characters speaking english are overdubbed with english , and poorly too .  whether this is just a very bad case of looping , an effort to minimize accents , or a simple case of nostalgia , it does achieve the same level of distraction present in all of jackie's dubbed films .  the plot in mr . nice guy is negligible , merely an excuse to have jackie on the run from various goons .  but even though plots have always been second to the action in jackie's films , it seems odd that the filmmakers have stuck us with this tired retread .  look , if you have jackie chan playing a chef , why not use that to your advantage ?  watching jackie doing his stuff in a kitchen , beating the bad guys with foodstuffs sounds like the perfect setup for innumerable comic stunts .  the action is a mixed bag here .  there's really only one no holds barred fight scenes that have become the trademark of jackie's films .  it takes place in the arbitrary location of a construction site , apparently for the sole reason that there are lots of nifty things lying around that can be useful ala jackie chan .  the action in the film is neither jackie's best nor worst , but you long for some more inspiration in the scenes .  the film's gratuitous use of slow motion is distracting .  once or twice , it may be useful to highlight a spectacular stunt sequence .  but to slo-mo jackie running ?  either this is a nod to the six-million dollar man , or a pathetic attempt to disguise the fact that jackie may be slowing down .  if you've seen all of jackie's films and are in need of another fix , go ahead and see mr . nice guy .  however , if you're just in the mood for some good action , you'd be better off hitting the video store for some of his better work , such as supercop .  |-0.4666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment of the text is negative due to its criticisms of the film's weak plot, terrible dialogue, and little acting ability, though it does acknowledge the presence of jaw-dropping action sequences as a redeeming factor.

""  this quote deals directly with my opinion of this film , because quite frankly , it's not even worth mentioning .  director david fincher ( seven ) has completely gone over the edge .  with crude humor , an intolerable script and 2 hours and 19 minutes of pure torture , i'm surprised i didn't walk out .  this just goes to show that hype kills .  it's very rare that a film so hyped up as "" fight club "" turns out to be noteworthy , and this is no exception .  the story goes like this .  edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions , until he meets marla ( helena bonham carter ) .  norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle , when he spots her at a session that he also attended .  apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like , literally living in pain .  why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me , but things do get worse .  norton is soon assigned to a job that calls for traveling , and it's on a plane that he meets tyler durden ( brad pitt ) .  the two men develop a bond , and go out to a bar , and by golly after they get drunk , the two pitiful characters fight .  how do they come up with this stuff ?  anyway , their fighting catches other pathetic loser's attention , and a club is formed .  out of all this mess , there manages to lie a message .  fincher shows us that society is like robots .  we work in our jobs doing things step by step , and want out .  our insanity gets to our brain and makes things worse than they really are , and we blame it on others .  call me crazy , but this is common knowledge .  i think fincher was acting as if the film is moodier and more poignant than it really is , which is probably one of the reasons it fails miserably .  even with two good actors , and a solid actress , they only manage to weaken the story .  i couldn't help but hide my face in shame when norton beats himself up into a bloody pulp .  it just shows how desperate the script is for attention .  i guess brad pitt was right for this role , because i felt like beating him up myself .  his bothersome and depressing character , made me disgusted at his 20 million fee .  it only showed me that he was in it for the money and nothing more .  helena bonham carter however really had no purpose .  she just popped up on screen , mumbled some lines , smoked and left .  this continues for what seems like 6 hours .  the film drags on and my headache gets bigger , while "" fight club "" nears what i think might be the end .  unfortunately by then , the film hits rock bottom .  though the conclusion kept my interest for a mere 5 minutes , it backs down again and continues to move at a snails pace .  on a side note , the trailer shows the only redeeming elements of the film , that coincidentally lasts the same amount of time that they did on the trailer .  fincher will hopefully regret making this film or at least learn a lesson .  concentrating on the atmosphere or a particular key moment , won't do any good if everything else is in need of support .  also , i'm afraid that immature men might respond to the film's violence .  the last thing the world needs is people praising a leader of a pointless cult .  when the film ends , i'm just glad to get home and take some advil .  you'll either enjoy what the film has to offer , or agree with ed norton when he says "" this is so f * * * ing stupid .

0|"the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes , with everything ranging from "" l . a . confidential "" to "" palmetto "" to "" the big lebowski , "" has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran , talented directors .  with this particular genre , directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower-class and the glamorous , opulent upper-class , while maintaining the noirish , ambiguous ambience , the staple of film noir .   "" wild things "" could be classified as a black comedy , a sultry film noir or a plain ol' erotic thriller , but the one category it doesn't qualify for is that of a quality motion picture .  overacted , overwrought and overlong , "" wild things "" is a confused mess , a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too .  with its incalculable twists , turns , more twists and more turns , it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness .  in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon , who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal , "" wild things "" not once jells in its eroticism , unpredictability , character motivation , sense of the world , plot , etc . there's not one redeeming quality in the picture that is not technical .  directed by john mcnaughton ( "" henry : portrait of a serial killer "" ) , "" wild things "" follows sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a hunkish , suburban florida high school teacher who's the dream of every spruced up female in the community .  particularly one .  kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) adores him to such extent that she offers to wash his jeep with a partner .  soon , her tiny shorts are soaked and tells the other girl to take a hike , enabling her to come into his house .  next thing , she cries rape .  and the so-called "" roller-coaster ride "" ensues .  a second accuser comes front , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , a booze-drinkin' , tattooed piece of trailer trash that charges lombardo of sexually molesting her , virtually guaranteeing a trial where preposterous confessions , asinine occurrences and laughable courtroom procedures are bound to happen .  even bill murray gets into the act as lombardo's zany lawyer .  he wears a fake neck- brace , waves the finger at the other client and infuses the script with some billy murray .  you can tell mcnaughton knew he had nothing to lose assigning murray to this role .  as ridiculous as it sounds , he's the most sane character in the movie .  the community is astonished .  reporters flee to the scene .  there's an 8 . 5-million settlement for a libel suit against kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) .  there's the ambiguous cop ( kevin bacon , who also executive produced ) who sniffs something iffy in this concoction of deceit , murder and lust .  we , the audience , sniff something not so lustful .  like so many thrillers these days , including "" the usual suspects "" and "" the game , "" "" wild things "" eschews character for plot .  mcnaughton knows how to handle the camera , and he keeps the campy fillings of the script flowing with workmanlike ease , as if he knows the territory he's covering is a harmless appetizer to accompany "" henry , "" a furious , unsettling film directorial tour- de-force .  george clinton's score is a delight to behold .  but it's the humans .  the characters are mere devices for the "" nasty "" twists .  what writer stephen peters does not grasp is this becomes tediously uninvolving , almost unbearable , if those who inhibit this twisted world are not interesting , don't feel real or we don't care for them .  not even the unintentionally funny moments work .  the people in "" wild things "" are not so much people as they are caricatures .  then there's the erotic content , which nearly earned the film an nc-17 , for a sexless , badly edited , poorly lit menage-a-trois .  and in what has to be one of the most flabbergastingly inept scenes that has graced this country , kevin bacon's member makes a cameo appearance with ten minutes to go .  ironically , the wildest elements of "" wild things "" are not wild at all .

0|"it rocks-actually , lots of rocks fly at us or from us , in slow or fast motion , at several points in the film .  they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward , and when they land-once in a while , when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like .   ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . )  they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon , a steroid user's answer to deep impact .  bruce willis stars as harry stamper , a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond "" zero barrier "" and destroys our planet .  why an oil driller ?  they require someone experience with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid .   ( in one unintentionally ( ? )  hilarious sequence , nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it .  we trust nasa to build space shuttles ? )  harry assembles the obligatory "" ragtag "" bunch of "" cowboys "" , including a blond guy , a fat guy , a black guy , a wiseass , and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) .  once they reach space , we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes .  whether or not they save the day , i will not reveal .  nor will you care .  i will say this : you know you're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope .  willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck .  their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act , in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material .  steve buscemi's character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic .   "" rockhound "" , as he's called , is sarcastic and foolish , so they tape him to a chair , where he spends most of the film .  so why did they bring him up there to begin with ?  rather , why write him into the film ? -give  his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis , who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter , firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig .  i'm guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel , at least in my world where the sky is blue .  liv tyler is pretty and humourless , as always ; suspiciously , four of her father's band's ( "" aerosmith "" ) songs grace the soundtrack .  director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick , like ketchup , eventually drowning the movie on-screen .   ( the middle hour is a non-sensical , pyrotechnic assault on the average primate's brain . )  whenever someone dies in this movie , a crew member inevitably yells out "" we lost ( insert dead person's last name here ) ! ""  i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one , and close-ups of the corpses' faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance , as their skin was often covered in fake blood .  armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla .  it looks nicer , and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework .  it has a vivid soundmix .  but at almost two-and-a-half hours , i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story .  the love story has been played up in the ads , perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever .  bollocks !  the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler .  remember a little film called jaws ?  in this film , three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark .  they didn't much like each other at first ; eventually , they started to respect one another .  one of jaws' great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories .  this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer , jerry bruckheimer , who throw too many characters into the mix and expect we'll care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end .  not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-i'd be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before "" action "" was called .  a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who don't bare their souls , who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery .  to this , i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic , nor brave , nor smart , even : this team couldn't build a birdhouse .  and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-i've never been a prouder wimp my whole life .

0|"there's a 1 , 000-foot tidal wave at the end of deep impact .  i'd say it pretty accurately represents the towering flood of the last two years worth of disaster movies , which are getting more irwin allen- esque with every release .  the early wave of this revival , while just as cheesy and laughable , at least knew to include thrills every five to ten minutes .  deep impact tries to disguise itself as a human drama , with endless filler comprised of disaster prevention plans the country keeps taking .  the repeating cycle is as follows -- the president ( morgan freeman ) will go on tv and tell the country that there's a remote chance a comet will strike the earth , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem .  then we get to see the plan in action , in some sequence utterly lacking suspense .  the mission will barely fail , and freeman will tell the country that the comet is still headed toward earth , and there's a remote chance it will strike , but that the nation's crack scientists and astronauts have some brilliant plan to stop the problem .  it goes on and on throughout the movie , but every time freeman goes on tv , we know his plan is going to fail .  how do we know this ?  because we've seen the tv ads for deep impact , ads that feature freeman telling the nation that "" the comet is still headed right for us "" and show disaster shots of the comet striking earth and the giant tidal wave spreading .  ladies and gentlemen , that is the movie .  successful disaster movies have the main disaster toward the beginning and more little disasters that follow , but deep impact saves its one disaster for the end and discloses all in its 30-second tv spots .  television is what's wrong with deep impact .  the main character , played by tea leoni , is a low-level broadcast journalist for msnbc ( and that's the mere tip of the product-placement iceberg ) who stumbles upon a huge government conspiracy .  she thinks it's an instance of an ex-secretary of something or other ( james cromwell ) resigning because of a mistress , and that maybe he took the fall for the president in the same area .  when she goes nosing around cromwell , he begs her to keep it under wraps .   "" i know you're just a reporter , but you used to be a human being . ""  she figures out what's really going on after getting roughed up by some fbi men and doing an internet search , where all good journalists learn the difference between a mistress and an extinction- level comet .  upon a top-secret meeting with president freeman , leoni agrees to keep the story under wraps until the president can hold a press conference , at which she gets to ask the first question .  and everyone knows , if you get to ask the first question , baby you're a star .  leoni ends up in the anchor chair , broadcasting every step of the comet's collision course with earth .  and i'm sure it's comforting for her to know that , even though the world's ending in a matter of months , she's a cable news personality .  so there she is , narrating the six-astronaut mission to blow the comet up .  such personalities as robert duvall , jon favreau and blair underwood cash their paychecks and go through the motions of this dragged-out process .  but as anyone who's seen the commercials knows , the astronauts fail .  they only end up breaking the comet into two pieces , which means even more destruction to the earth .  yeah , thanks , nasa .  that's when freeman has to come on tv for the last time and say goodbye to all the people who aren't picked to live in the missouri cave site for two years .  they even have animals , two by two , ready to climb into the cave .  if the focus had been on people living inside these caves after the world had been destroyed , deep impact could have been a far more interesting movie .  instead we watch as a lovestruck elijah wood defies all odds to chase down his young wife , while people pack the highways out of town .  the reasoning is , of course , that if a comet is going to strike , they might as well be out in some scenic rural location .  and , amusingly , the highway is spotted with people in u-haul trucks .  i'm sure it's comforting to know that , even though the world's ending in a matter of minutes , the u-haul people are doing the most business of their lives .

0|" "" there will be another , "" the ads for this sequel proclaimed , and why not ?  true , brandon lee is dead , but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994's the crow , anyway .  the idea of spinning artist james o'barr's original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie , taking its own righteous vengeance against the world .  given that basic framework , the story could move in any number of directions .  of course , it doesn't .  stubbornly , the crow : city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film , when lee's eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death .  i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality .  in flashback , we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover , and then we watch in real-time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind .  it's loud and repetitive , true , a sadist's delight -- but it's also horrifying and fascinating .  city of angels gives us more of the same , but less skillfully .  there's an audience guaranteed for a film like this , although bad reviews and poor word-of-mouth will likely ensure that it won't be much of a success .  in fact , miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings .   ( i've never understood the reasoning behind this tactic , since good notices have never been key to the success of movies like the crow . )  so much for any confidence in the worthiness of their followup .  this time , ashe ( french-accented actor vincent perez ) is retrieved from his watery death ( he and his young son were shackled together , shot , and then thrown off a pier ) by the crow who serves as his link between the worlds of the living and the dead .  perez might have some screen presence if he's given something to do with himself , but here he's simply thrown in front of the camera as a pretty face .  at first , he's shivery and frightened , but he quickly recovers from the shock of his own death and becomes a badass biker from beyond the grave .  he's befriended by sarah ( mia kirshner ) , presumably an older version of the child who narrated the first film .  kirshner , so beguiling in exotica , is here an exquisitely photographed blank .  tattooed with angels' wings , sarah is just about as lovely as women come , but she serves no purpose , not even as seductress .  the gang of punks who killed ashe are ostensibly commanded by judah ( richard brooks ) , but a far more interesting choice as leader would have been iggy pop , who plays a gaunt fellow named curve .  iggy , all bones , veins , and drawl , is the only one who seems to have shared in the aesthetic of ruin that defines this film .  like all good things here , he's dispatched too soon and without much imagination .  in the meantime , we're subjected to tedious glimpses of judah's compound , where bondage is the order of the day and hot wax is poured over naked bodies in s&m fantasies that would seem shy of the cutting edge even if they weren't distinctly secondhand .  even the soundtrack is tired .  more than anything i've seen from hollywood lately , city of angels smacks baldly of product -- it's a movie with a lousy script but a great look .  critics have been quick to fault the direction of mtv veteran tim pope , but his work isn't that bad per se .  he's got a good eye , and some intriguing visual ideas -- if anything , this movie has a few too many scenes of ridiculously striking imagery .  his major stylistic failing is that he can't seem to direct an action scene , and the quick , nonsensical cutting that ensues is reminiscent of a low budget kung fu movie .  but as director , he must also shoulder the blame for the little screenplay that wasn't , the performers who couldn't , and an apparent lack of ideas on the parts of everyone involved .  who bought david s . goyer's anemic script , anyway ?  the producers of this crow were either too dim to realize their story was doomed to be a hollow rehash , or too cynical to figure their audience would know the difference .

0|for better or worse , the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated , oversexed , underwritten thrillers .  apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer doesn't change a thing , since body of evidence wasn't written by him , but has a puzzling eszterhas-ish presence all over it .  in other words , it's a ) really dirty and b ) really , really stupid .  madonna ( first warning sign ) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job ; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi-naked , presumably for the edification of the shrimp .  she's been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover .  already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie cannot be sexual unless she's under thirty ( or at least looks it ) , and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men .  what's worse is that the movie confirms all the above , and wallows in them as well .  madonna's character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition .   ( and yes , there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy .  this movie leave no scummy stone unturned . )  anyway . willem dafoe ( very good but completely wasted ) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna's sexuality .  how do we know this ?  because his character is set up with the token wife and kids .  how obvious is it that he's gonna cheat on her and have to fess everything up ?  and get kicked out of the house ?  and get welcomed back anyway ?  don't skip to the end yet ; we're just getting warmed up .  dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie .  most of it is about as erotic as open-heart surgery , since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax ( always the kink of choice among screenwriters who don't know the first thing about * really * kinky sex ) and smashed light bulbs .  don't ask .  another thing that people are starting to realize about explicit sex in movies is that unless it is critically important to the story , it's insanely dull .  what's worse is that body of evidence is dull * everywhere * , not just in the sex scenes .  the stuff in the courtroom is recycled ninth-hand from other bad courtroom drama scenes .  the thriller business itself is ridiculous -- it involves nasal spray bottles and drugs , and juergen prochnow as a surly doctor .  and the ending -- another homage to eszterhas , maybe ?  -- is one of those endings where you can almost see the exact * frame * where one of the five or six various endings to this mess was spliced in .  the director is uli edel , all the more disappointing since he also directed the elegiac and powerful last exit to brooklyn and christiane f . everyone has to eat , i guess , but this isn't a meal ticket , it's leftovers .  |-0.8833333333333333|0.8833333333333333|0.7666666666666667|"The overall sentiment of the explanation is that the text expresses strong negative criticism towards the movie ""Body of Evidence,"" describing it as dirty, stupid, sexist, underwritten, dull, and disappointing.
