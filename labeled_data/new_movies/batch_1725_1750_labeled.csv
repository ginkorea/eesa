0|"the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission .  he attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth , but misses .  after they ricochet off his face , he says , "" not a good start . ""  as it turns out , this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence , but to the rest of the movie as well .  in this , the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong , chan plays an international operative codenamed "" condor "" , and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazi's during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war .  for some reason , condor is given his mission at the u . s . embassy in spain .  i think this may have been done so that in a chase scene , they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart .  watch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country , most notably in europe .  the chase will take itself through a marketplace , and a fruit cart will be overturned .  it's almost a guarantee .  anyway . . . .  condor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden ; the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it , which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly .  to help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly , condor is accompanied by a desert expert ( carol cheng ) and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold ( eva cobo ) .  there aren't supposed to be any relatives of the nazi captain living in spain , but condor finds the granddaughter by looking her up in the phone book or something .  although these two women are supposed to be integral parts of the mission , they prove no help at all except to get in trouble and provide an excuse for chan to jump into his martial arts .  in fact , most of the scenes are so ridiculously contrived that it seems everything is just a way to set up a fight .  i suppose this isn't so bad , since chan's action is really the best part of the movie , and the only reason you go to see one of his films anyway .  if you've never seen a jackie chan movie , don't expect a great plot , but do expect to be entertained by his moves .  they are so well choreographed and often so amazing that you wonder if this guy is human .  knowing that he does his own stunts , and knowing that this is the real stuff ( no computer-masked bungee cords here ) makes the action sequences all the more exciting .  you've got to hand it to a guy who's probably broken every bone in his body for the sake of his art .  also of note in this , as in any jackie chan movie , is the humor .  as far as i know , none of his films take themselves too seriously , and even the dramatic parts have a certain tongue-in-cheek quality about them .  what is almost masterful is the way that humor is even integrated into the fight scenes .  unlike a martial arts film such as anything with jean claude van damme , where the fights get you on the visceral level , fight scenes in chan's movies are simply entertaining .  you marvel at both his moves and at the way he employs them in such a way to make you laugh .  unfortunately , even chan's mastery can't save this film .  the plot and characters are so weak that they don't hold the movie together at all , and the acting is terrible .  carol cheng has apparently won best actress honors at the hong kong movie awards in the past , but since operation condor is a dubbed movie it kind of takes all bets off .  this , combined with an obviously low production value made we want to turn away from the screen until i heard those kicks start flying .

0|"cashing in on the success of white men can't jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles ( including the cowboy way and drop zone ) , wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed , hoping that they can strike up the same success .  sadly , if this dismal , cliche ridden and mind-numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by , they haven't got a chance in hell of even coming close .  this time out , the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops .  following several run-ins with their tyrannical boss ( robert blake ) , who is obsessed with the "" money train "" --a train which carries all the subway's takings--and will let nothing stop it ( now * there's * an original plot device ) , harrelson's character decides to try and take off with the cash .  along the way , both of them fall in love with the same woman--another transit cop who also hates her boss .  this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard ( 'you were always the better brother' etc . etc . etc . ) , and doesn't help to add anything to the film .  given a better script , better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time ( the film almost went for two hours--or did it just feel like it ? ) , this film might ( and i mean * might * ) have turned out okay , but as it is , it is stocked with the worst action film cliches , whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time .  robert blake , who plays the evil boss , has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history !  he sounds like wayne newton , and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets !  but this is only one of money train's problems .  if you look at the script as if it was an action film , it lacks originality and suspense .  but if you try to look at it as if it were a heist film , it is even worse .  the final robbery sequence is almost trivialised and the characters definitely ain't butch and sundance .  the film isn't all bad though .  snipes and harrelson , when they aren't using the dumb cliches that the script gives them , make an agreeable duo , and some of the stunt-work is indeed excellent .  but good stunt-work cannot save a bottom-of-the-barrel action movie .  if you're a really undemanding action freak , there's a chance you'll like this .  but if you're looking for something original , or suspenseful , try somewhere else--i doubt you'll find it here .

0|girl 6 is , in a word , a mess .  i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film .  there was no sense of where the film was going , or any kind of coherent narrative .  if there was a point to the film , i missed it .  girl 6 , by the way , is the way theresa randle's character is addressed in the phone sex workplace ; all the girls are known by their numbers .  the plot , such as it is : theresa randle is a struggling n . y . actress , and eventually takes a job as a phone-sex operator .  she begins to lose contact with reality , as her job consumes her .  also , she must deal with the advances of her ex-husband ( isiah washington ) .  he is an ex- con thief , and she tries to keep him away , while at the same time , it's clear that she still harbors feelings for him .  her neighbor , jimmy ( spike lee ) functions as the observer ; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6 .  he also functions as a point of stability , as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex .  the soundtrack , consisting of songs by prince , was jarring .  it kept taking my attention from the film - not altogether a bad thing , i'll grant you , as what was transpiring onscreen wasn't that riveting .  for parts of the middle of the film , the music stayed blissfully in the background .  in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film , however , the music was particularly loud and distracting .  of course , i've never really cared for prince's ( or tafkap if you like ) music .  prince fans might love the soundtrack , but it will probably be distracting , even to die-hard fans .  of the performances , the only one that stood out was spike lee's buddy character , jimmy .  he was excellent as the always-broke neighbor of girl 6 .  he should have stuck to acting in this film .  there are several sequences that gave me the impression that he'd like to be oliver stone when he grows up .  there are scenes shot with different types of film , which are purposely grainy , and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone's natural born killers .  in that film , they worked to propel the narrative .  in this film , they just made me more confused .  there are some amusing moments , and a few insights into the lives of the women who use their voices to make the phone-sex industry the multi-billion dollar industry that it has become .  other than that , though , nothing much happens .  there are a few intense moments , as when one caller becomes frightening , but even that is rather lackluster .  i'm not the biggest fan of spike lee , though i'd agree that he has done some very good work in the past .  in girl 6 , though , he seems to be floundering .  he had an interesting idea , a fairly good setup , and seemed to wander aimlessly from there .  girl 6 earns a grade of d .  |-0.5666666666666668|0.8000000000000002|0.9|"The explanations indicate that the film ""Girl 6"" by Spike Lee has received negative feedback due to its messy and incoherent narrative, distracting soundtrack, confusing sequences, lackluster performances, and overall low rating."
0|back in 1980s , chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films .  he couldn't , of course , top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger , but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot'em up and beat'em up genre aficionados .  that quantity was mostly provided by cannon group , prolific production company that dominated the b-movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap , formulaic and , more often than not , unwatchable genre products .  the hitman , 1991 action thriller directed by chuck's brother aaron , is one of the last among them .  chuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed , shot and left for dead by his partner ( which shouldn't surprise anyone , considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks , specialised for roles of usually very mean characters ) .  surviving the shooting , cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent .  he infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman , using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations - italians , french canadians and iranians .  since it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris , at least not in this kind of movie , the biggest attraction of this film should have been action .  well , the action in this film falls flat - it is boring , repetitive and not at all exciting .  it is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films .  we know very little about norris' character while , on the other hand , gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension .  in the end we almost feel sorry for them , since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade .  during the film , somebody obviously became aware of that problem , so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris .  that caused another problem - any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot - this one dealing with lady lawyer who sleeps with the hero and gets killed after fulfilling that screenplay obligation .  the photography in this film is dark , setting is depressive and this forgettable piece of 1980s style cinema leaves viewers without any reason to justify the hour and half spent in watching it .  |-0.7000000000000001|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment of the texts is negative as the reviewers criticize the film's action scenes, lack of character development, uninteresting plot, boring and repetitive scenes, forgettable nature, and lack of justification for watching it.
0|as forgetful as some people may be it is doubtful that anyone could forget their wedding , especially three times .  but , alas professor brainard somehow manages to accomplish this feat twice before the momentous night that he actually creates flubber .  it's amazing that he is able to remember any of the processes he uses to make anything .  the whole point here is how could a man be so blatantly forgetful .  this is not absent minded this is almost mindless and he is a professor .  well , this is the case for about the first half of the movie then things begin to settle into what might truly be considered absent minded .  along the way to becoming absent minded from absent of mind the professor stumbles onto flubber .  thankfully or there would be no movie or any amusement for the audience .  the flubber is supposed to be flying rubber , but it seems to have a life of its own .  this is there strictly for the kids .  the properties of the flubber provide some antics for the audience when flubber coated golfballs and bowling balls assail two would be thugs .  although amusing this is not original what so ever and brings back haunting memories of home alone .  the poor professor has to save the university where he teaches at , get his fiancee back , finally stop the plotting of an evil millionaire , and do all this in the funniest way possible .  admittedly there are funny moments but the movie is rather shallow and does not compare very well to the original ( the absent minded professor ) .  the whole scene with the basketball game was just atrocious and totally unbelievable .  the basketball players , stereotypically unqualified for the sport , somehow manage to bounce , fly and dribble their way back to being close to winning ?  this just sounds too bad to be true , the least that could have been done was keep semi close to the original movie to give this film a chance .  as for innovations and new ideas there is but two good ones in this movie .  giving life to the flubber , which is so poorly executed that it's best forgotten , and prof . brainard's flying robot weebo .  giving life to the flubber would have worked beautifully if it wasn't for scenes of the sort where you have the flubber dancing around on tables and books for no real reason other than to put in a bit of music and extend the length of the movie .  the life of the flubber had brief and rather whimsical moments where it might have been used well , but it wasn't and in the end might have done the movie more harm than good .  now , weebo is a totally different story .  it's a robot that prof . brainard created but forgot how and gave something of a life too .  this is a really original idea , well maybe not , but it is an idea that is well executed and in the end makes the poor robot the most developed and real character in the movie .  yes folks the little yellow robot has more emotion and character than the characters .  the film lacks the emotional punch to pull the audience in at all .  the acting by robin williams ( prof .  brainard ) seems to be half hearted for most of the movie and in many cases quite forced .  most of the acting in the movie was so convincing as to fool only the part of the audience that had not quite yet reached the age to 12 .  people when stood up at the altar , don't usually give third chances .  or for that matter talk to the fiancee afterwards , but what can be expected this is a children's movie .  flubber , as a movie does little original and is nothing special in any respect .  with the best character in the movie being something of a prop i doubt that many people will find it all that great .  it does have its amusing moments and it is a good story in the end , but it does not wash up to the original .  kids should find this movie amusing and fun and they'll probably enjoy the whole movie .  as a movie it's just a kids movie and not the best of ones at that .  |-0.5166666666666667|0.8333333333333334|0.85|In summary, the overall sentiment of the text is negative, highlighting criticisms of forgetfulness, shallowness, lack of emotional impact, and unconvincing acting in the film.

0|"how do you judge a film that is so bad , but intentionally so ?  in spiceworld , the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal : mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it .  if that was their goal , they did a fantastic job .  so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it wasn't really meant to be much better than this ?  honestly , i'd rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades , so does that mean i graded it inaccurately ?  truth be known , i don't really think i can answer this question .  to understand spiceworld , you have to understand the spice girls .  unless you're very * very * young , or fairly older , you probably have at least heard of them .  they're a group of five busty british babes who've had #1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions .  they're primarily adored by pre-teen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice's ( real name : geri haliwell ) wonderbra .  all five of the girls have these "" spicy "" names for which they are better known than their real names .  there is the aforementioned ginger spice , as well as sporty spice ( melanie chisholm , or mel c . ) , scary spice ( melanie brown , or mel b . ) , baby spice ( emma bunton ) , and posh spice ( victoria addams ) , and all of them , to some degree or another , resemble their stage names .  the spice girls took the world by storm , and spiceworld is actually a good- humored spoof of all that transpired during their quick rise to fame .  it's quite nice to see what good sports the girls are ( and not just the one dubbed sporty ) about poking fun at themselves .  they don't take themselves too seriously , and that's probably the best thing about them .  it's also surprising how natural they seem in front of the camera * acting * , and not just singing and dancing .  they're not flawless by any means , but for the most part , they deliver their lines without feeling staged , and , like them or not , we get the sense the five are very at home within their characters ( which seems reasonable since they portray themselves ) .  what makes the film bad is that extreme fans of the spice girls won't get enough of their music , while the rest of us don't get enough of a movie .  the real point of this is to look at the spice girls for over ninety straight minutes .  most of the film is very blas ? , but several parts are downright boring , and then they have those sporadic moments that actually make us laugh out loud !  if you're a big fan of the group , you probably won't get enough of what you want , and if you're not a big fan , you get too much time devoted to nothing more than "" look at us "" moments .  for the right crowd , the "" music video "" sequences will be the highlights of the film , but for others , they will serve as three-minute lulls in a hectic-but-overall-uneventful storyline .  other key actors include richard e . grant as clifford , the spice girls' manager , alan cumming as the film-maker piers cutherton-smyth who attempts to make a documentary of the group , george wendt as martin barnfield , a producer who constantly works on pitching a spice girls movie , and roger moore in a small , self-parodizing role .  all provide relatively good performances , keeping in mind once again that this film wasn't meant to be acted seriously .  even meat loaf shows up as dennis the bus driver and seems to have fun with it .  while this film is continuously compared to the beatles' a hard day's night , i think that is an unjust comparison .  it is supposedly the movie studio that first mad the comparison by way of press kits , but i don't think drector bob spiers , nor the spice girls , intended it to be so .  i think the studios were just trying to boost hype and interest in the film , and have instead , come off rather pretentious .  i don't think this film is trying to be anything more than a fun , satirical look at a group that got so big , a movie seemed the next likely step .  and what could've been better than a self-indulged yet self- mocking approach ?  probably nothing , and so it is .  spiceworld is a movie i thought would be embarrassing to enjoy , but now instead , i find myself wanting to defend a movie i didn't even give a good review .  it's bad , but it succeeds in every way it intended .  it gives the spice girls a chance to play while allowing all those obsessive fans out there to indulge in every brainless moment .  perhaps the group is nothing more than a gimmick .  if that's the case , the movie's gimmick is that it * is * such a gimmick !  you might be saying , "" a spice girls movie ?  come on ! "" , but when it comes down to it , i think that's the point .

"" &nbsp ;  there are even some subtle tie-ins with contemporary ufo-ology , including the "" greys "" and the roswell crash of 1947 .  &nbsp ; 3 . &nbsp ;  is the movie any good ? &nbsp ;  no . &nbsp ; the x-files is a dreadful movie and shows some fundamental problems with writer/creator chris carter's talents and the relationship between cinema and television .  &nbsp ; first off , the screenplay by series creator chris carter is sloppy and cliched . &nbsp ;  after approximately forty-five minutes ( the length of a television episode minus the commercials ) , the pace drops to a snail's crawl . &nbsp ;  not long after that point , when carter attempts to answer some questions we have had about the series , we wish he had not . &nbsp ;  the explanations are so trite and ridiculous that one would have preferred it had carter not explained quite so much . &nbsp ;  i am willing to suspend my disbelief a fair bit , but the absurdity carter wants me to swallow was just too much . &nbsp ;  breaking the suspension of disbelief destroys the movie - and listening to other fans leave the cinema , maybe the series too .  &nbsp ; the explanations are not only absurd , they are tired and unoriginal . &nbsp ;  the extraterrestrials breed and gestate like those from the alien series , and their craft looks like a leftover set piece from independence day . &nbsp ;  note that the alien movies , id4 , and the x-files are all from 20thcentury fox - a studio that is beginning to cannibalize itself i think .  &nbsp ; the x-files is noteworthy for being the only movie based on a television series to be produced while the series was still running . &nbsp ;  in comparing the movie and television series certain aspects of the respective media emerge .  &nbsp ; the avoidance of the series to answer the questions it raised annoyed and frustrated many people . &nbsp ;  however , i rather liked that about the series . &nbsp ;  television allows you to impose as much , or as little , meaning on a show as you want . &nbsp ;  it is the proverbial "" blank screen "" which we project our minds on . &nbsp ;  meaning on television is open and ambiguous ; it is the nature of the medium .  &nbsp ; cinema , on the other hand , is the opposite . &nbsp ;  it projects onto us the filmmakers mind . &nbsp ;  we can , in some films , fill the textual gaps ourselves , but that almost never happens in an american film . &nbsp ;  meaning , in cinema , needs to be self-contained and determined .  &nbsp ; so , when the x-files made that jump from small to big screen , carter needed to take into consideration the differences in the medium as well . &nbsp ;  he did not . &nbsp ;  by making explicit , what the television show left implicit , carter reveals the limits of his creativity and skill .  &nbsp ; when they say that "" fans "" make a tv show , it is not far from the truth . &nbsp ;  on television , fan culture must impose its meanings on the text because there is nothing there . &nbsp ;  how true that is when we see the "" explicit "" x-files - there is nothing there .

0|"contrary to popular belief , not every single foregin film released to an american market is a masterpiece .  some of them aren't even good .  some examples of this principle are the aboslutely dreadful "" un indien dans la ville "" ( presented as "" little indian , big city , "" and remade into that crap tim allen flick , "" jungle2jungle "" ) , and this .  what could have been a clever little sex comedy turns into one mess of a french flick .   "" french twist "" ( the "" cool "" american title , not the real one , which was "" gazon maudit , "" literally meaning "" twisted ground , "" or something like that ) deals with a married couple with kids , and the intrusion of a stranger who kinda screws things up for them .  loli and alain chabat ( victoria abril and alain chabat ) are not exactly happily married .  always on business trips , alain chabat more than once cheats on her , and she eventually finds out .  and one day , she meets a butch mechanic , marijo ( the co-writer/director josiane balasko ) , and they two kinda hit it off .  so she decides she will get back at alain chabat by doing the obvious : sleeping with marijo .  but she soons starts to not only fall in love with marijo , but she's also realizes she's still in love with alain chabat .  so , of course , she does the obvious from that : she decides to keep them both .  she'll be ( and sleep ) with each of them for 3 days each , then on sunday , she'll rest by herself .  after all , she needs it if she's gonna have more sex than sylvia kristel .  the film goes on for over an hour and a half , through stupidity after stupidity , moronic twist after moronic twist , and soon there's the little ironic ( ! ! ! )  ending .  i know it's a completely different culture , and i'm quite familiar with the french and their cinema , but this is just bad .  none of the characters are more intelligent than peter stormare in "" fargo "" ( a movie where stupid characters were backed up to make a point ) , and any action they do is pretty much just to get a hopeful chuckle from the audience .  what's shocking is this was not only one of france's biggest hits , but it was nominated for a lot of cesars ( french equivalent of oscars ) .  the writing and directing is really the big problem with it .  josiane balasko does a good acting job with her role , but her little sex comedy isn't very humerous , entertaining , or even deep at all .  even woody allen's not-very-good "" a midsummer night's sex comedy "" is intelligent , well-written , and possesses some depth .  this is shallow , unfunny , and pretty annoying to watch .  the film moves at the pace of a snail , and is damn-near painful to watch .  thank god for the fast forward button .  the acting , however , isn't bad at all .  the actors do the best they can with the bad material , and victoria abril is pretty likable despite the script ( and the fact that she's stupid enough to try to divide herself over two people when she has kids ) .  and alain chabat has some funny moments as the neurotic husband .  but "" french twist "" is just pretty lame .  it's not overly horrible , and has a couple very , very , very brief moments .  but it's just a really crap film , and an example of an ill-advised distribution of a foreign film .

0|i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stone's `any given sunday' .  it's an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rock-em , sock-em profession of pro football .  unfortunately , the director seems to have only one priority on his mind : sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers .  in altering each frame with quick-flash photography and dizzying , in-your-face editing , stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics .  we see glimpses of greatness , but `any given sunday' has its agenda all tangled in technical gobbledy-gook .  it grows tiresome and monotonous .  yes , stone has pulled a brian depalma .  matters of importance are pushed aside right from the get-go .  tony d'amato ( al pacino ) , coach of the struggling miami sharks , finds his team stuck in a losing rut .  aging quarterback cap rooney ( dennis quaid ) appears to be losing his touch , and d'amato can't seem to ignite any passion in his squad .  when cap is injured on the field , and after a patch of unlikely events occur , third-string qb willie beaman ( jamie foxx ) is brought into the game .  once in the huddle ( and this becomes an in-game ritual ) , beaman horks all over the field .  nerves , you see .  eventually though , the ancy youngster wins the game for his teammates , sparking his rise to fame in the football world - the endorsements , the music videos , etc . - and stone straps us in for the jolting ride of behind-the-scenes stress and fury that the business is apparently like .  and i believe it .  there is some intriguing insight posed , but in the big scheme of things , stone fumbles the ball .  the problem with the director's visual approach is this : he uses extravagant editing devices when a more conventional approach would have been appropriate .  football is an exciting game to watch , but stone seems to think dizzying the audience with an assault on the senses will only add to the adrenaline rush .  i guess he is mistaken .  `any given sunday' is a visual kaleidoscope that leaves the audience in a frustrated stupor more frequently than it excites them .  many football fans ( including one i attended with ) are liable to be disappointed with the `ultra-stylish' way stone has decided to present the game .  in return , a three-star film becomes unfortunately degraded due to the director's tampering .  in welcome scenes when the visual pummeling comes to a break , this actually shows decent character development and interaction .  for instance , heated returns between d'amato and feisty young owner christina pagniacci ( cameron diaz ) are enjoyable to watch .  there is also a solid performance from jamie foxx , who experiments with great success in his first trek into dramatic territory .  the stellar supporting cast includes matthew modine , aaron eckhart , lauren holly , ann-margret and charlton heston ( in an extraordinarily brief appearance ) .  unfortunately , too many big names are wasted - a typical demise for a film with such a large and experienced cast .  pacino makes some interesting progress with his character .  you begin to identify with coach d'amato and the morals he is striving for . . . .  but i often felt he was just another play thing stone could weave in and out of his editing dynamics .  `any given sunday' is a watchable but disappointing sports film in which plot and characters take a back seat to excessive filmmaking technique .  and a very distant back seat , at that .  |-0.149|0.8333333333333334|0.7999999999999999|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is that the text expresses disappointment with the film's excessive filmmaking techniques, specifically criticizing the director's prioritization of flashy camera techniques over character development and football politics, and expressing frustration with the ""ultra-stylish"" presentation of the game.

0|this well-conceived but ultra sugary coming-of-age film is not for everyone , and i include myself as one of those who found it too sappy for my digestion .  joseph cross ( joshua beal ) is a 10-year-old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather ( loggia ) to bone marrow cancer .  loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner , it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup .  the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family , where everyone is just so nice and affluent , and properly religious without being fanatical .  the beals , the father ( denis leary ) and his wife ( dana delany ) , are both successful doctors ; julia stiles plays joshua's older sister , needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him .  this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven , but living in south philadelphia , sending their children to a well-run catholic school .  joshua , the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn , is a handsome , sweet , intelligent , friendly , and endearing child , who does well in school , relates to the nuns and priests , and talks politely to his well-meaning parents .  all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch .  the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather , who promised to be with him forever .  his answer is to search for god , pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do , but that's just the way it is , sometimes .  this search for god takes us nowhere because , as his friend david ( reifsnyder ) says , where can you look for him if he doesn't exist .  now , that's a smart kid .  but joseph looks for him in the usual places , and what better place than to start in the parochial school he attends .  one of his teachers is the kind-hearted sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , who wears a philly baseball hat and equates the jesus stories with baseball , making him the clean-up hitter , and in my opinion , if she wasn't a big tv star , would have a vocation as a parochial school teacher , she is that convincing .  throughout the film , she is saved from answering any tough ( sic ! )  question about god by the bell , as it rings to end the class .  nothing much happens in the search for god , there is no parody of the catholic school ; though a visiting cardinal is found by the boy not to be able to talk to god , but this is gentle stuff , no real criticism or search for god is attempted .  what comes next into play is some hollywood hokum , which is designed not to upset anyone , as joseph has a reassuring encounter with a real , live angel , a blond little boy his own age and dressed like him in the catholic school uniform who wears the innocuous smile of a goody-goody .  the film ends as this angel ( ! ! ! )  tells him his grandfather is all right .  his quest is ended , as apparently angels don't have wings and are approachable ; and god , well , . . .  maybe that's for another film down the road .  this part of the film was the final straw for me , i couldn't swallow any more goo .  as this film flopped commercially , his next one , the sixth sense , pared down the schmaltz and came up smelling like a rose .  though if you look through the cleverness of both scripts , this director is loaded with hokum , all he has learned how to do , is hide the hokum better .  well , god bless him , if he can do that .  this is a nice family picture and there is room for it in hollywood .  it's just too bad that it had nothing relevent or even truthful to say about death , children in a parochial elementary school , or for that matter , about god .  and that family of his , they're too good for words .  yet the film meant well and its benign message had its heart in the right place .  for those who want to see something soft , without a bite to it , this is the one .  |-0.6|0.8666666666666667|0.7999999999999999|The overall sentiment of the text is negative, as the reviewer criticizes the film for being overly sugary, lacking depth, and portraying a perfect family dynamic.

0|" "" battlefield earth "" is the best comedy of the year .  it has to be .  the other prospect is just too horrifying to consider .  bad movie syndrome struck me again , so after witnessing how much "" battlefield earth "" has been proclaimed a train wreck in both critical and popular circles , i felt the masochistic urge to see the disaster first-hand .  is it as bad as advertised ?  oh yes , very much so .  the plot is incomprehensible .  the acting is atrocious .  the special effects are mediocre .  the action is dull .  the implausibilities are legion .  the dialogue is cringe-inducing .  the whole package is funny when it wants to be serious and irritating when it wants to be funny .  i don't even want to continue reviewing this movie ; i'd like to purge the atrocity from my mind as soon as possible , but you probably want to read my thrashing in all its sarcastic glory , so here it is :  the premise is basically a rip-off of "" planet of the apes , "" only minus the apes and philosophical discussion , and plus a race of evil aliens from the planet psychlo .  the year is 3000 , the psychlos have conquered earth , and the human population has been enslaved .  only a handful of humans escaped to radiation-rich areas to escape the aliens ; they live out their lives in fear .  one man , johnny goodboy ( i know , i know ) tyler ( barry pepper ) , ventures to the outworld and is captured by the psychlos .  there he confronts the psychlo head of security : a big , ugly , klingon-looking creature called terl ( john travolta ) .  pressed into slavery , johnny vows to lead a revolution and take the planet back .  meanwhile , terl is faced with his own problems : he has recently learned that he's stuck living on earth ( which he hates ) for the rest of his career because he pissed off his boss by sleeping with the big man's daughter .  he decides to give johnny knowledge of the psychlo language and technology ( this is where the plot gets ridiculous .   .   . )  so the "" man-animal "" can lead a mining expedition into places the psychlos can't go .  terl then plans to keep the mined gold for himself .  of course , his plan doesn't work .  so many things wrong with this movie -- where to begin ?  how about with travolta , whose hollywood clout brought about this , the cinematic version of scientology guru l . ron hubbard's sci-fi novel ?  early previews for "" battlefield earth , "" with constant shots of a makeup-laden travolta cackling like lex luthor , had me ( and several audience members ) remarking , "" what the hell is travolta thinking ? ""  the movie did nothing to stem such remarks .  all that ridiculous cackling he did in the trailers is in full force here : terl cackles after nearly every line , and so does every other psychlo .  of course , this makes every scene hilariously overwrought , no more so than when the script clumsily stumbles into political commentary .  the psychlos are probably supposed to be some kind of satire of corporate america , but ceos generally don't laugh maniacally after denying pay raises to their employees .   ( "" you were going to be promoted -- but now you're not !  fwahahahahahahahaha ! ! ! ! ! "" )  it's no big surprise terl loses to the humans -- he's an idiot .  he breaks every kind of supervillain rule in the book .  he underestimates his enemies , assuming he'll win just because he's smarter .   ( he uses the word "" leverage "" like some sort of scientologist mantra . )  not content to go the james bond villain route of explaining his plans to the hero , he hooks him up to a machine that gives him knowledge of all the psychlos' language and technology .   ( why this machine is even around in the first place is beyond me . )  he then appears shocked that johnny points a gun at him .  no wonder this guy never got his promotion .  the plot inconsistencies are too numerous to mention .  why do the psychlos build an earth base in which both they and the human slaves must wear little breathing apparatuses to survive ?  how come the psychlos are wasting their time mining for gold when the doors of fort knox are wide open ?  how in the world did all those fighter jets survive sitting in a hangar for 1 , 000 years ?  and how do all these previously brain-dead cavemen learn to fly them so quickly ?  there's a whole lot more to scratch one's head about in "" battlefield earth . ""  bring a scorecard to track the plot holes .  director roger christian shoots "" battlefield earth "" in the most distracting way possible , tilting nearly every shot sideways for no discernible reason .  all the characters appear to be standing on the walls , and it's awfully difficult to watch a movie when you must tilt your head just to watch ordinary passages of dialogue .  the action sequences are atrociously edited , every one turned into an endless slow-motion parade that drains all potential excitement .  are these things really so hard to construct ?  my respect for supposed "" lightweight "" action directors has grown by leaps and bounds after witnessing in "" battlefield earth "" how badly an action sequence can be shot .  this movie is an absolute headache .  it's not just the shot selection and editing ; the movie , quite frankly , makes no sense .  for most of "" battlefield earth's "" running time , i just didn't know what was happening .  it didn't have anything to do with me finding the events stupid or illogical ( though they certainly are ) -- i really had no idea what the hell was going on .  when i pieced the plot together later , it didn't look any better .  here's how much of a disaster this is : "" battlefield earth "" is already the worst movie of the year , and it's going to take something really , really inept to top it .  the only thing we can take comfort in about the film is that no one will be suckered into joining the church of scientology because of it .  in fact , i'd think that hubbard's cult would want to distance themselves from this bomb as fast as possible .  that'll teach me to give into bad movie syndrome again .

0|when a film is produced on a shoestring budget by a couple of hardworking filmmakers and when it tells the story of a genuine tragedy , the easy path for a reviewer who hated the movie is to give it a pass .  toss out your usual objectivity , ignore how many times you checked your watch while viewing it , forget how unbearable it was to sit through , and find some meaningless way to compliment it .  this , of course , will be of no service to your readers , but at least you'll avoid the hate mail from the movie's fans .  thus it is with a heavy heart that i review the movie paulina ( not to be confused with the recent movie paulie about a talking parrot ) .  directed by vicky funari as a labor of intense love - she spent the last one third of her life on film - the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez .  paulina was a maid in vicky's household when vicky was young .  i got to learn the film's background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present .  for those without such context , the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film .  the acting is amateurish , the story is maudlin , and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie .  grainy and overexposed , the movie , shot on 16mm film and videotape , has little to recommend it .  confusingly composed , the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story .  quite bloody at times , the story , full of horrific images , seems designed to shock and repulse us .  why else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8-year-old paulina ?  another scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her .  in retaliation , she bites off part of his finger .  this covers the both of them in a bucket of blood .  the passengers on the bus then view the girl in their minds as everything from saint to sinner .  one , for example , sees her as an aztec priestess holding out a large heart that she had just cut from a body .  the lugubrious tale has paulina being raped and beaten .  certainly she had to endure a miserable life .  but that does not guarantee that a movie about her will necessarily being good .  i felt trapped in the theater watching it .  only the opportunity to talk with the filmmakers afterwards made the movie bearable .  paulina runs 1 : 28 .  the film is in spanish with english subtitles .  it is not rated but would be an r for violence and nudity and would be acceptable for older teenagers .  |-0.7876666666666666|0.8663333333333334|0.8576666666666668|The overall sentiment is negative as the reviewers express disappointment and criticism towards the movie, describing it as amateurish, maudlin, confusingly composed, visually unappealing, and containing uncomfortable and shocking scenes with explicit violence and nudity, leading to a feeling of being trapped while watching it.
0|"in this year's summer movie preview issue of _entertainment_weekly_ , theresa connelly described her writing-directing debut , _polish_wedding_ , as "" a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would . ""  one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film , a comedy-drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements .  the family at the center of _polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks , which consists of mother jadzia ( lena olin ) , father bolek ( gabriel byrne ) , sole daughter hala ( claire danes ) and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness .  it's a large family , but there's not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch , certainly not in the primary trio .  jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family , but she's kind of a hypocrite since she's carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija ) .  her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek , who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration .  also , how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy , sexy jadzia ?  hala is a spoiled , self-centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy .  with such an unappealing set of characters , it's no surprise that _polish_wedding_'s plot complications are far from involving .  naturally , jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop , russell schuster ( adam trese ) , who fathered the child , but he refuses to make such a commitment .  ho-hum .  another complication , involving the decidedly un-virginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary , is first played for laughs and then , inexplicably , as a profound statement in the film's climax--which , ironically , is funnier than any of the film's lame attempts at humor , such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell .  that scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly .  the jadzia-bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers .  the hala-russell conflict isn't resolved in as contrived a manner , but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something .  and then there's some atrocious dialogue , which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound : "" look at all these pickles .  just looking at them gives me such great sadness . ""  as misguided as _polish_wedding_ is , the affair is something of a letdown , considering the strong performances by byrne , danes , and especially the fiery olin .  they obviously believed in connelly and her material--a faith that audiences will be hard-pressed to share .

0|several days after having seen this movie , i'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest , a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate , found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes .  this is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio .  there's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script .  the premise doesn't sound especially amusing to begin with ? almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers , the effeminate leslie edwards ( matthew perry ) and the uncouth bartholomew hunt ( chris farley ) , who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest .  edwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies ( albeit of the early-19th century variety ) , including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages ( none of which prove to be useful ) , a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest , and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries .  along the way , the intrepid explorers encounter bears , bald eagles , aging native american warriors , and a conquistador named hildago ( kevin dunn ) who raves about his beautiful hair .  the explorers' trek takes them through forests , across the snow-capped rocky mountains , and over a waterfall .  this setup leads to a lot of shouting , a great deal of lunacy , and very few laughs .  farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing , but , aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle , his heart doesn't seem to be in it .  matthew perry , one of the stars of tv's friends ( who had some modest success in the romantic comedy , fools rush in ) is badly miscast .  as a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy , perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man .  i'm not a big fan of david spade , and i didn't like tommy boy , but at least he and farley worked well together .  as far as the supporting players go , none of them makes more than a fleeting impression .  eugene levy is wasted , and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla .  frankly , it's a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest , the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap , the big picture , and waiting for guffman .  although guest gets the costumes right , this nearly-inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution .  the special effects , such as they are , are execrable .  for an example of some really poor blue screen work , look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids ( they're obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them ) and where farley is being carried off by an eagle .  even though farley didn't have the most stellar of acting careers , he doesn't deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes .  while some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12-year old boys , the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric .  farley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty , since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session .  |-0.9|0.9166666666666666|0.8000000000000002|"The movie ""Almost Heroes"" receives overwhelmingly negative reviews, with critics describing it as dreadful, lowbrow, and terrible, lacking laughs and suffering from poor execution, bad performances, and weak humor.

0|"when i was nine , i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store .  masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures : they combined science fiction and fantasy , had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read .  of course , the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history .  given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon ( not to mention its moderately successful spin-off she-ra : princess of power ) , it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together , come with the result of "" trillions "" and make a live-action masters movie .  let's be blunt : masters of the universe is a very bad movie .  the story is painfully dull and mind-numbingly cliched ( hands up who * wouldn't * guess he-man and skeletor take their fight into the real world ) and is acted out by either incredibly untalented actors ( dolph lundgren as he-man for one ) or good actors ( james tolkan , meg foster ) given such awful characters and dialogue that they can't help but seem terrible .  it is extremely clear that someone making the movie wanted it to be as good as star wars .  we have the alien bounty hunters , the desert skif technology , stormtrooper lookalikes and a musical score so reminiscent of john williams that "" deja vu "" is too polite a term to use in describing it .   "" blatant uninspired ripoff "" would appear more appropriate .  tv fans might want to check out courtney cox ( monica in friends ) and robert duncan mcneill ( lt paris in star trek : voyager ) , very early in their careers and not doing to well in them either .  so in the face of such mindless sub-mediocrity , is there anything to make masters of the universe worth watching at all ?  yes , there is .  one incredible good reason .  his name is frank langella .  langella has always been one of the underrated actors of hollywood , appearing in countless films over the years .  here he plays skeletor , the villain of the piece .  dressed in opulent black velvet robes and bearing a skull for a face , he is one part darth vader , one part emperor and two parts grim reaper .  given this character , langella falls right into it with style and precision .  skeletor is believable , interesting and manages to tread the fine line between being a homage to the past and startlingly original in his own right .  masters of the universe .  i remember loving it when i was eleven .  at twenty one it's difficult to see why .  but , as i said , it is blessed with a superlative villain who makes the entire thing worth the tedium of the remainder .  besides , this year marks the film's 10th anniversary .  watch it with some friends for a good laugh and celebrate .

0|"talk about beating a dead horse !  when home alone was released in 1990 , it was a breath of fresh air , and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely-funny family film .  the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel , so , two years later , we were subjected to home alone 2 , which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited .  for john hughes , two home alone movies weren't enough ? he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with , including a pathetic box office bomb called baby's day out , last year's live-action 101 dalmatians , and this year's flubber .  now , inexplicably , hughes has exhumed not only these worn-out plot elements , but the "" home alone "" name as well .  the result ? 1997's worst sequel ( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin ) , home alone 3 .  by changing the characters , hughes ( who wrote and co-produced the film ) , along with his co-conspirator , director raja gosnell , has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest .  the new kid , alex pruitt , is played by alex d . linz ( one fine day ) , and the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness .  he's not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was .  the villains , pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern , are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber .  in home alone 3 , there are four of them ( olek krupa , david thornton , lenny von dohlen , and rya kihlstedt ) , but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls .  this time , the kid isn't left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip .  instead , he has developed a bad case of chicken pox , so he can't go to school .  his dad ( kevin kilner ) is away on business and his mom ( haviland morris ) has to run errands , so , for the most part , he's all by himself during the day .  through a series of coincidences too irritating to relate , a top secret u . s . air force integrated circuit comes into his possession .  it's wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex's home to retrieve it .  the eight- year old , who is wise beyond his years , booby traps the house with all sorts of rube goldberg-type devices designed to humiliate and incapacitate the villains .  the movie's climax takes place during a raging snowstorm ? only none of the falling flakes looks remotely believable .  previously , the most counterfeit-looking snow effects i can remember were in star trek iii .  these are far worse .  in fact , the production values are so shoddy that there are some scenes in the midst of this near-blizzard when a shining sun can be seen .  if it's a wonderful life could generate real- looking snow back in the 1940s , why can't home alone 3 , which has a significantly larger budget and '90s technology at its disposal ?  there has been an ongoing debate regarding the appropriateness of live-action cartoon violence for young children .  home alone 3 will add fuel to the fire .  it's one thing to see wyle e . coyote flattened by a 10 ton acme weight , but quite another to watch a running lawn mower fall on lenny von dohlen .  adults and even older children will recognize that this is obviously fake and intended to be humorous , but what about five and six-year olds ?  the level of violence in home alone 3 is extreme ? many of alex's schemes are nasty enough to kill .  but , because this is a "" family film , "" no one dies , despite being electrocuted , falling thirty feet , and getting smacked on the head by a barbell .  not only is home alone 3 unnecessary , but it's offensive .  it's an exercise in tediousness , and there isn't a genuine laugh to be found from the beginning to the end ( unless , by some strange quirk of fate , you have missed every 1990s movie associated with john hughes , and thus haven't seen this stuff before ) .  i can't imagine anyone with a reasonable attention span being more than momentarily distracted by this pointless adventure .  maybe that's why the only ones laughing at the screening i attended were still in their thumb-sucking years .

0|"conventional wisdom among collectibles retailers is that children's items begin to dramatically escalate in price about twenty-five or thirty years after the item was made .  that's when the kids of that time have jobs , disposable income and a desire to re-visit the awe and wonderment of childhood that has disappeared from their lives .  check out the prices of toys from the late sixties and you'll find that yogi bear lunch boxes are demanding big bucks .  there's a heavy nostalgia nowadays for the late sixties and early seventies and nowhere is it more apparent than on the big screen .  boomers are now mostly in their forties and fifties and have lived in the work-a-day world for a long time .  they'd like to re-capture some of that fun they remember from days of yore .  hollywood seems more than eager to churn out product to help them .  directors are zealous to put their stamp on icons from that time .  and for the most part they're messing it up .   "" mission impossible "" , "" lost in space "" , "" godzilla "" , "" zorro "" .  none of these successfully capture the originals .  none of these are even good films .  you can now add "" the avengers "" to the list .  the british television series began in 1961 .  super secret agent john steed ( then-patrick macnee ) and his third partner , emma peel ( then-diana rigg ) are the pair that the american audience fell for .  surrealistic and witty , the series fit the mood of the times .  the leather-clad rigg probably didn't hurt the ratings either .  after all it's not a coincidence that you can't pronounce her character's name without "" appeal "" .  now we're in the nineties .  steed ( now-ralph fiennes ) and peel ( now-uma thurman ) are battling evil genius sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) who is screwing with england's weather .  that's about as much of a plot as we have .  there's some footage about a lot of other things that either don't make sense or make even less sense .  we get betrayal for some unknown reason .  evil clones appear and vanish and have no connection to the film .  remarkably ineffective giant flying robot wasps with machine guns in their belly come from nowhere for no good reason .  there's a high tech hot air balloon , but i have no idea why anyone's in it .  the spy agency is run by a man called "" mother "" who is in a wheelchair and a woman named "" father "" who is blind . . . at  least in some scenes .  there's probably a reason for all of this , but we'll never know it .  macnee makes an appearance of sorts .  he is the voice for an invisible man whose character goes nowhere in a scene that does nothing .  a group of villains sits around a table , all clad in huge pastel-colored teddy bear outfits .  at first it's humorous to watch the teddies waddle around , but then it becomes goofy .  the movie is a medley of clutter , confusion and wrong decisions around every corner .  it feels like major portions of the film are missing .  the storyline jumps rather than flows .  reportedly the film was re-cut several times .  this is one of those times where the whole is less than the sum of the parts especially since some of the parts appear to be missing .  there's one good point where peel is running from one room to another in a house designed by escher .  other than that , the effects are second-rate .  the weather threat is old hat as are the scenes of huge tornadoes .  thurman almost makes an adequate emma peel but it doesn't work .  she looks good , dresses in all the right fetish outfits but there's no spark .  fiennes fares even less well .  macnee's steed was a witty man of the world with a sense of humor .  fiennes' agent comes across as a dour kid in grown-up clothes who has never been out of his home town .  even connery , one of the greatest living actors , doesn't have much of a presence outside of a few fiery scenes .  the action scenes are difficult to follow .  director jeremiah chechik ( responsible for the atrocious remake of "" diabolique "" ) somehow manages to put the camera exactly where it shouldn't be .  things happen , people move around , but even if , with the utmost effort , you were able to care about any of it , the scenes are bewildering .  the primary allure of the original was the interaction between the two leads .  witty banter and an underplayed sexual tension were a winning combination .  admittedly there are a few humorous sexual puns in the film , but there's no chemistry and the repartee is anything but clever .  one of emma peel's first lines of dialog is "" rules are made to be broken . ""  it doesn't get any better .  advance word alone should have been enough to scare off anyone .  the release date was changed several times .  connery refuses to promote the film .  there was no screening for critics which may have been a good choice for warner brothers .  at least this way , they get something of an audience for the first weekend before the news gets out .  admittedly i haven't seen an episode of the television series for a couple of decades .  my guess is that it would be severely dated now .  no matter how antiquated it might be , there's no doubt that it holds up better than this film is at first viewing .  there's no reason to waste any part of the last few days of summer inside watching this movie .  no reason at all .

0|"the following review encompasses two versions of dune :  dune : the theatrical version ( 1984 ) runtime : 137 minutes capsule review : cut down to just over two hours by nervous studio executives , the theatrical version of dune is a spectacular mess and may be incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book .  the film's visual splendour , mystical beauty and impressive action scenes only partly compensate for gaping holes in the narrative .  dune : the extended version ( 1988 ) runtime : 189 minutes capsule review : a bit of a throw-together assembled by mca tv special projects for cable television .  it was disowned by director david lynch but it's considerably closer to his original vision by virtue of its improved characterisation and clearer storyline .  quality dubs of this version from the out-of-print japanese laserdisc release are available from various dealers on the world wide web .   * * * the review * * *  released in 1984 and made on a then mammoth budget of $40 million , the film of frank herbert's cult novel dune was eagerly awaited by sci-fi fans .  director david lynch ( blue velvet , eraserhead , twin peaks ) was working on his biggest production to date , a mammoth undertaking filmed under trying conditions on location in mexico .  the screenplay was lynch's own , chosen after the script submitted by original author herbert was rejected .  dune is set in a universe ruled by powerful families overseen by a successive line of emperors .  the key to cosmic power is the planet arrakis ( dune ) , a windswept desert planet that's home to giant sandworms and the precious spice melange .  the spice is the most valuable commodity in the universe .  it extends the life and expands the consciousness of those who consume it .  most importantly , it allows the navigators of the spacing guild ( once human but now hideously mutated ) to "" fold space "" and navigate their spacecraft across mammoth distances instantaneously , enabling interstellar commerce and trade to flourish .  lynch's film by necessity excises parts of the book while retaining the story's two main strands .  one is the long-standing rivalry between two families , houses atreides and house harkonnen , and their battle for lucrative mining rights on arrakis .  the second strand is the emergence of young paul atreides as the reluctant messiah long-awaited by the natives of arrakis , the fremen .  the deeply religious fremen want control over their homeworld , and young paul may be the fulfilment of their prophecy that a man would come from the outer worlds and lead them to freedom .  unfortunately , this epic story unfolds in a confusing and haphazard manner in the theatrical cut of the film , which runs 30 to 60 minutes shorter than what lynch originally intended .  the thinking among universal's oh-so-wise money men was that films over two hours in duration were not popular with audiences at the time and would not do well at the box office .  with lynch's initial cut running at closer to three or more hours , the studio demanded that further cuts be made .  what a great idea !  why not trim down an already complex film so as to make it almost incomprehensible ?  the most glaring consequence of this one-eyed stupidity is a hopelessly jumpy narrative , leaving us with badly underdeveloped characters .  thus their personalities are vague , their motivations unclear and , in the case of paul's father duke leto , their demise rather meaningless .  the end result is a distinct chill : we can't warm to most of the cast and we don't care much for them .  and it hardly helps that the voice-over narration is sparse and that the dune-esque language and terminology sounds like so much gobbledegook to those unfamiliar with the book .  dune is also a very serous film .  the constant "" self-talk "" by various characters makes it so serious and self-absorbed at times that you may find it hard not to wince with embarrassment .  the overall impression is a world full of people so intense that no one is allowed a joke lest the universe come crashing down around them .  humour - or at least a gentle kind of humour as distinct from the harkonnen's mad , sadistic kind - is hard to find .  you may balk at the comparison , but as a writer lynch could well have done with some lessons from george lucus' star wars trilogy .  the theatrical version is still some way from being a complete disaster , however .  it still possesses enough of lynch's stylistic quirks and enough visual invention to sustain the interest of viewers with a taste for imaginative sci-fi .  special effects whiz carlo rambaldi's giant sandworms are an awesome sight .  both the production design ( anthony masters ) and costume design ( bob ringwood ) are striking and original .  and the magnificent score by toto and brian eno is one of the most underrated soundtracks of the last twenty years .  with these elements in place and the benefit of freddie francis' lush cinematography , the film is at least a feast for the senses .  see it in the widescreen format if you can .  and despite all the cuts , several cast members still make a strong impression , most notably kenneth mcmillan as the supremely nasty baron vladimir harkonnen .  sian phillips also registers strongly as the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam , leader of the bene gesserit religious order who's secret aim is to manipulate paul's destiny for its own shadowy ends .  as paul atreides , the young kyle maclachlan starts off somewhat shakily , but as his character grows in strength so does his performance and he emerges as a credible leader of the fremen crusade .  the conclusion ?  any assessment of this film must take into account that frank herbert's original novel is a complex piece of work and presents a tough challenge for any filmmaker .  david lynch took a brave stab at it and , partly due to forces beyond his control , ended up with an officially released version that fails in several key respects .  dune certainly confused and frustrated a lot of people on its release .  many chose to stay away altogether , as the film's disastrous box office showing attests .  the extended version , however , is a rather different beast .  in 1984 lynch stated his intention to release his own special edition "" director's cut "" of the film on home video , a clear indication of his dissatisfaction with the version that ended up in the theatres .  but , alas , he failed to do so , choosing to move on to other projects .  in a way , then , it is partly lynch's own fault that what appeared instead was an unauthorised extended version , put together in 1988 by mca tv special projects for airing on cable networks in the usa .  stung into action , lynch successfully petitioned the director's guild to take his name off the credits and replace it with "" allen smithee "" , the standard pseudonym for directors who wish to disown their own work .  he also had the screenwriting credit changed to the anonymous "" judas booth "" .  certainly , looking at the results of mca's handiwork there's at least half a dozen instances that , for sheer technical sloppiness , are good enough reasons for the director to object .  but these gripes must be considered in light of the improvements that the extended cut of dune offers in several crucial areas .  most of the changes involve the restoration or extension of cut scenes and the addition of extra narration , both of which fill many holes in the original version's storyline .  paul's relationship with his father and associates is more intimate , with moments of humour and warmth lacking previously .  the political skulduggery involving the emperor , the spacing guild , the bene gesserits and the two warring houses is far better explained .  paul's initiation into the fremen way of life on arrakis is also fleshed out considerably .  and as further background , a new prologue has been added featuring narration and painted stills to give us a brief history of the dune universe .  as a piece of storytelling , then , mca tv's version of dune is clearly superior .  as a piece of editing , however , it is at times surprisingly inept .  the use of painted stills in the new prologue works well enough , but their occasional appearance once the action begins is inappropriate .  there's some sloppy cutting , too , and in a few instances shots even appear out of order .  and the use of repeated footage to fabricate certain scenes ( eg .  ships coming and going , soldiers coming and going ) is at times clearly out-of-context .  this is the kind of thing to which lynch objected , and rightly so .  it should also be noted that several questionable scenes and shots from the theatrical version were deleted to satisfy the censorship demands of u . s . television .  but the most notable omission is a gratuitous piece of nonsense from lynch that wasn't even in herbert's book .  the scene features baron harkonnen killing a beautiful young man in front of his slobbering henchmen by pulling out his "" heart plug "" .  its a surreal and disturbing episode that's very lynch-esque but adds nothing to what we already know : the baron is a nasty piece of work .  despite its own peculiar flaws , then , the extended version of dune is a generally superior film .  all up , it contains 35 minutes of restored footage and approximately another 15 minutes of either altered , fabricated or newly created sequences .  unless the idiosyncratic lynch has a sudden change of heart , the "" alan smithee "" version remains the closest we'll get to what the movie should have been .  on repeated viewings , one suspects it is closer than what lynch would be prepared to admit .  still , as one of this century's great science-fiction novels , some fans and perhaps the late herbert himself would argue that dune deserved a better fate in its transfer to the screen .  with rumours circulating of a new six hour mini-series planned by production company new amsterdam entertainment in 1998 , it is unlikely that we have heard the last of the dune saga .

0|in 1970s , many european intellectuals , especially those on the left political hemisphere , became obsessed with the rise of fascism .  which wasn't so hard to expect , because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies .  in such times , when political involvement could be associated with noble passion , many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre-war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany .  of course , there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other , less noble reasons .  for them , moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era .  which , naturally , made some of those films very popular among teen audience .  one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass , who later made career shooting expensive , stylish soft porn .  salon kitty , his 1976 film , is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern , book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2 .  in 1939 , walter schellenberg , one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite , exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats .  none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents , and that all the rooms happened to be bugged .  the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty , nominal madame of the brothel , didn't know the real purpose of that enterprise .  screenplay by tinto brass , of course , simplifies the story and changes few names .  schellenberg is now wallenberg ( helmut berger ) , ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top .  kitty kellerman ( ingrid thulin ) , apart from being madam , has a second job as a cabaret singer .  caught in the net of depravity is sweet , innocent girl margerithe ( theresa ann savoy ) thrown into brothel .  there she falls in love with customer hans reiter ( bekim fehmiu ) , disenchanted pilot of luftwaffe .  when margerithe discovers that her lover had been executed for defeatist speeches he made in the brothel , she finds out that the place is bugged .  she informs the madam of the real situation , and both women decide to confront wallenberg .  those who tend to bash benigni for exploiting holocaust as the topic of comedy would probably go bananas watching this film , that uses the darkest pages of european history for cheap sexploitation .  but , although salon kitty doesn't happen to be anything more than rather more stylish and expensive soft porn ( although not very successful ; some of supposedly erotic scenes are quite unappealing ) , it does try to have more multidimensional characters and even something resembling dramatic conflict - this time between power-hungry and scruples wallenberg and hedonistic womanhood symbolised by kitty .  unfortunately , brass seems to overuse other cinematical references , probably thinking that he could repeat the successful interaction of berger and thulin in luchino visconti's the damned , but the most noticeable and irritating is ingrid thulin's unsuccessful attempt to imitate lisa minelli's musical numbers from cabaret .  all in all , salon kitty is failure , although with some very interesting moments .  |-0.39999999999999997|0.8000000000000002|0.8333333333333334|"The text explores the negative sentiment surrounding the obsession of European intellectuals with fascism, the portrayal of sexual depravity in films, and the criticism of ""Salon Kitty"" for exploiting European history for sexploitation.

0|dr dolittle ( 20th century fox ) running time : 1 hour 25 minutes starring eddie murphy directed by betty thomas riding high on the success of the nutty professor ( 1996 ) , murphy returns in this abysmal comedy .  he plays doctor john dolittle , who as a child had the ability to understand animals .  however , after being 'exorcised' he loses this ability , and we fast forward to see dolittle in a crummy job surrounding by crummy people ( most notably dr mark weller , played by oliver platt . )  however , with a bonk on the head his ability to understand animals returns , and 'comedy' is ready and waiting to happen .  except comedy never does happen .  doctor dolittle , even with the excellent premise , rarely manages to raise a laugh .  poor old murphy looks bored stiff throughout the whole movie , and his performance suffers .  the manic murphy we saw in the 80's is gone , his more mature ( and more boring ) twin appears to be getting all the work in the 90's .  the voices of the animals , which include albert brooks , chris rock ( the 'new' eddie murphy ) and norm mcdonald as 'lucky' the dog are marginally better , and at least they put enthusiasm in the movie .  sadly , most of their lines are pretty dumb .  and they're not 'funny' dumb , like dumb & dumber ( 1994 ) , but just boring dumb .  the film even succumbs to fart jokes halfway through , in a desperate attempt to raise some laughs .  there are a few good jokes in the script , but they are few and far between .  if i had to choose a favourite performance , it would probably be albert brooks tiger , who has a certain charm about him .  sadly , he's barely in the movie , and rock's really annoying hamster is given far too much screen time .  joke wise , we are thankfully , spared the mocking and insulting type of jokes that featured heavily in the nutty professor .  the director , betty thomas , has , well , done better films .  she bought us private parts ( 1997 ) and the brady bunch movie ( 1995 ) which were , sadly , much better than this .  the scenes lack any charm , she just gets the job done .  the animals themselves , are reasonable realistic , although most of them are obviously puppets .  there's an impressive looking tiger , however , and the lip sync is pretty good .  you'd have no problem guessing that most of the close up's are puppets , however , with their jilted movement .  i was hoping jim hensons workshop , who created the furry friends , would have done a better job .  doctor dolittle , in the end , is a disappointment for everyone involved .  murphy has done much better movies ( i . e  trading places ) the director has seen better days , and even the creatures aren't that good .  the target audience , aged between 7-13 , who are undemanding , will probably like it however , thanks to it's dumbed down humour .  everyone else , however , should give doctor dolittle a miss .  |-0.7166666666666667|0.9|0.8333333333333334|"The explanations are all negative, highlighting the lackluster comedy aspect, Murphy's underwhelming performance, the script's deficiencies in delivering good jokes, the director's inability to bring charm to the scenes, and the overall disappointment.

0|"the general's daughter is a heartless , absurd film , a movie so hopelessly dedicated to its inane plot that it forgets entirely about its own characters .  director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham-handed obscenity , creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo-depth .  what's worse is that the movie is haphazardly glued together by two characters who are neither interesting nor sympathetic -- the ridiculous story requires them to do unbelievable things in the interest of reaching a dark conclusion in a sudden rain storm .  john travolta finds himself in the middle of the mess , playing warrant officer paul brenner ; brenner is assigned to find the murderer and rape of captain elizabeth campbell ( leslie stefanson ) , daughter of general joe campbell ( james cromwell ) .  brenner is teamed up with ex-spouse sarah sunderland ( madeline stowe ) , and they check out all the suspects on the base , including elizabeth's mentor , colonel moore ( james woods ) .  soon , it becomes apparent that elizabeth was into kinky sexual stuff , but the question comes down to why -- and , of course , who .  ebert's law of the economy of characters can be applied here ; one interesting thing i noted is that not only are all the characters suspects at some point ( including the two protagonists ) , but almost all of them end up directly intertwined with the story .  perhaps i should have issued a spoiler alert before mentioning that , but it's painfully obvious from the beginning that everyone in the film is hiding something .  on a story level , the general's daughter is ineptly constructed .  the film , adapted by christopher bertolini and william goldman from nelson demille's novel ( which was apparently based on a true story ) , plods along to its conclusion , filling in the blanks with stale , unrealistic dialogue and "" shocking "" plot developments .  having not read the novel , it's difficult to determine if these problems are the fault of the adapters or the original author , but i suppose they all are guilty to some degree .  scene after scene stumbles with pointless insincerity ; minutes after finding the dead young woman , brenner and sunderland engage in sarcastic dialogue , which includes endless strings of forced lines .   ( sunderland actually asks brenner , "" why was she killed ? ""  to which i would have answered , "" if i knew , then the movie would already be over . "" )  only after we've spent twenty minutes or so with these characters do we learn that they have a sordid history together ; this angle , though apparently present to develop their characters , is never explored .  not that it really matters , since the characters consistently do ludicrous things for no other reason than to drive the plot .  in one scene , sunderland is attacked by a man in a mask .  she sees one of his rings , and she and brenner find the man later that day based on the ring .  instead of questioning him like as they would a real suspect , they take him to brenner's houseboat , beat him up , and pour hot coffee in his lap .  this scene really pushed me over the edge , not because it's gratuitous and mean-spirited , but because it illustrates the film's complete disregard for the characters and the audience .  it was impossible for me to feel anything for these people beyond this scene , mostly because nothing they do comes as a surprise .  i realized that these constructs on screen aren't actually characters , but devices present only to serve the story .  this would have been bad enough without the west's need to hose his movie down in tasteless images of rape and sexual misconduct .  compelling films about sexual crimes don't spend a lot of time on rape flashbacks , and they certainly don't show as much skin and sweat as a typical pornographic picture .  these scenes are not the least bit powerful ; on the contrary , they're intended simply to provide the audience with the necessary resentment for the villain , whomever that may turn out to be .  in addition , the movie treats sexual fetishes -- and sadomasochism in particular -- as if it's a perversion of everything we know to be pure .  this standpoint is certainly allowed , but only in accompaniment with well-developed themes to back it up .  as it is , the film forgets that a lot of people have sexual fetishes , and that putting on a pair of handcuffs does not make a person insane .  perhaps the only positive elements in the general's daughter are a couple of the performances .  james woods has a few terrific scenes , and plays his role with sharp , witty subtlety .  i also liked james cromwell , mostly because he comes across as slightly sympathetic despite the obvious intent of west to make him villainous .  nonetheless , these performances are undermined entirely by the dreary , obligatory atmosphere and the senseless neglect of characterization .  the general's daughter is the worst kind of hollywood film -- it pretends to have a soul , to be of strict moral code , when in fact it has nothing more than a group of cardboard cut-outs force-feeding the audience a toxic landfill of plot contrivances and one-sided moral judgments .
