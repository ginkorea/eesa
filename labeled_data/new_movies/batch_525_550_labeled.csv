1|" "" take a number , fill out a form , and wait your turn . ""  starring kati outinen , kari v ? ? n ? nen , sakari kuosmanen , elina salo ; written & directed by aki kaurism ? ki ; cinematography by timo salminen  it might be possible to call drifting clouds a satire or a black comedy , but that would imply a sense of anger , of vitriol , of energy ; drifting clouds is what you get when the rage and vitality are gone .  it is the sad , slow story of lauri and ilona , a married couple caught between the wheels of capitalism as it grinds inexorably onward .  he loses his job as a tram driver , because everyone drives cars nowadays .  within a couple of months , she loses her position as a head waiter , when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff replaced .  a conversation early in the film reveals a lot about their situation .  lauri has surprised ilona by buying her a tv , which she greets with little enthusiasm .  she notes that they haven't finished paying for the bookshelves or the couch yet .  he says that in four years the payments will be done and then they can buy some books for the shelves .  it would pass as deadpan humour if it wasn't spoken with such resigned weariness .  this sets the tone for the rest of the movie .  there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery , but at the centre there is frustration and futility , and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people , until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity .  there is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates , but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal : the movie is about two people and what happens to them , and nothing else matters .  lauri and ilona live lives starved for friendship , respect , culture , passion .  they go to the movies , and walk out past old posters for l'atalante and l'argent , but the movie they have just seen is a pointless , violent , unfunny comedy .  their house and workplaces are uniformly unpleasant , painted and upholstered in lifeless colours ( ugly greens , dull reds , insipid blues ) , full of inelegantly functional objects and appliances .  the art design is impeccable in its tawdriness , and director aki kaurism ? ki often matches the colour of characters' clothes with the background colour and/or lighting , so that it seems as if they are almost physically fading into the environment .  there is no suggestion of sexuality in the relationship ; ilona and lauri sleep in separate beds and their gestures of affection lack the heat of desire ; their lives are now bound by something more complex and desperate than love .  their downward , downsized , downtrodden lives have a momentum that is almost comic , as one setback succeeds another , bottoming out when lauri stakes all their remaining money on the spin of a roulette wheel .  it must have been tempting to play the story for more laughs , more farce , more deadpan wit , but the film's great strength is the sober , empathic manner in which it observes lauri and ilona's misfortunes .  irony would be an injustice .  situations and settings are broad and exaggerated--this is not realism--but they are not distorted .  the emotions are authentic .  if it is difficult to laugh at anything that happens , despite the droll performances , the laconic humour , that's because kaurism ? ki brings such compassion and understanding to the manifold indignities that are suffered .  he shows us how humiliating it must be for a woman of thirty-eight , who has worked long and hard to win a respectable position , to be forced to accept a job as a dishwasher in a two-bit restaurant ; how humiliating it must be for a man nearing 50 to confront his wife's former employer , demanding the rest of her wages , only to have the crap beaten out of him , unable to land a single punch , when the employer and his cronies refuse to give him the money .  all this is observed keenly , with great economy : every cut , every line of dialogue , is judicious .  if most films are novelistic in their telling , this one brings the focus and concentration of a short story to bear .  but what is gained in nuance and acumen is rather undermined by the sense that the material barely accommodates the 96-minute running length .  i have seen many movies far less profound , less humane , less necessary than drifting clouds , but they filled me with an urge to watch them again , and this one did not .  it does not need to be seen twice : its every detail and implication can be absorbed in one viewing .  it is not a movie that will be seen by a large audience , because it cannot be pitched to one .  there is no selling point .  it is all understatement , restraint , melancholy .  the characters are unremarkable , their best years behind them , their dreams dissipated ; it takes all the effort they can muster just to pay the bills .  this does not make them less fascinating , merely less marketable , which is a shame , because this is a movie which should be seen , precisely because it pays attention to people and emotions that most movies prefer to ignore .  it engages us and touches us and resolves--surprisingly , and movingly--into something resembling a happy ending .  the only thing greater than the ill-luck that governs the characters' lives is their refusal to give in to despair .  their persistence is rewarded with what might be called a "" feel-good "" ending elsewhere , but not here , because this ending differs in kind from most such endings : this one has truly been earned .

1|"ingredients : london gal , fate , true love , running joke about monty python's spanish inquisition  synopsis : american actress gwyneth paltrow with dark hair , playing a londoner ?  believe it .  sliding doors is a love 'what if' story .  the gimmick is that it's really two stories : the film follows the life of helen ( gwyneth paltrow ) down two directions .  in the beginning , likeable gal 'helen' ( gwyneth paltrow ) gets unexpectedly fired from her advertising job .  so she goes into the subway train station meaning to return home early to her apartment and her sleeping live-in lover gerry ( john lynch ) .  helen doesn't know it , but she is at a fateful junction in life : 1 ) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2 ) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future .  the film shows what happens in both paths , switching back and forth between intertwined , parallel stories .  in story one , helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james ( john hannah ) on the train .  arriving home early , she discovers that her live-in , gerry ( john lynch ) , is having sex with his former lover lydia ( jeanne tripplehorn ) .  this leads to a life where helen moves out .  helen's winsome new friend james helps her recover from a broken heart , and encourages her to start her own business .  in story two , helen experiences a different fate .  she misses the train , never meets james , and doesn't get home early enough to discover gerry's infidelity .  in this new life , helen takes up odd menial jobs , and faces the constant sneaking suspicion that all is not right with her relationship with gerry .  will the truth of the heart finally work its way through a number of problems and setbacks in both scenarios ?  opinion : rejoice all ye monty python fans , gwyneth paltrow fans , and watchers of quirky romance flicks .  at last here's proof that there's still creativity in 1990s filmmaking .  sliding doors is refreshingly different from anything this year .  not only is it a well-acted , heartwarming film , but it's also easily gwyneth paltrow's best recent performance .  when helen ( paltrow ) screams that her unfaithful boyfriend is a 'shagging wanker , ' ( a british phrase better left untranslated ) she sounds like she knows what she's talking about !  nor does sliding doors go overboard with formulaic true love or other stereotypes .  nobody scrambles around in danger , screaming , "" i will find you no matter what , my darling ! ""  when helen finds herself on a boat in the starlight with james , she doesn't take the easy way out and leap into his arms , since she's supposed to be recovering from heartache .  and handsome live-in boyfriend gerry isn't the stereotypical screen hunk ( either a stud or a snob ) .  instead he's a nervous and indecisive , almost helpless hunk .  another example : when one of the protagonists lies wounded in a hospital , sliding doors gives us neither the 'hospital miracle' nor a maudlin tragedy but surprises us with a third variation .  in other words , all of the characters seem non-stereotyped , human , and local .  there are minor inconveniences .  since sliding doors switches back and forth between two possible fates , it's occasionally difficult to distinguish between the two .  distinguishing between the two stories isn't a problem in the scenes containing paltrow , who sports two different hairstyles .  but in scenes containing only lydia and gerry , who look the same in both stories , it's slightly confusing .  also , quite a few snappy comebacks referring to american pop culture ( seinfeld , woody allen , etc . ) are spoken by the british characters .  but these seem slightly forced , given that the remaining dialogue is predominantly british slang .  possibly an attempt by the screenwriter to balance the british so that american audiences can feel more comfortable ?  sliding doors is a charming , quirky , original , happy romance with a little 'philosophy of fate' thrown in .  monty python and the meaning of fate , anybody ?

However, there are some minor concerns about distinguishing between storylines and the use of American pop culture references by British characters.
1|"sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist  by fernando vallejo  starring bob flanagan and sheree rose .  interviews by kathe burkhart , kirby dick and rita valencia .  produced and directed by kirby dick .  running time : 90 mins .  this film is not rated .  the central themes of "" sick : the life and death of bob flanagan , supermasochist "" are pain and love , and its subsequent effect on a person's life .  its protagonist , bob flanagan , who died at the age of 52 , suffered from cystic fibrosis , a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus , preventing him from normal breathing .  the movie is about much more than recouperating ( or attempting to ) from this disease .  an audacious , fabulously triumphant docudrama , "" sick "" chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious , unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years , sheree rose , who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film .  flanagan's idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes transcendental , similar to terry zwigoff's brilliant 1994 "" crumb "" , which also explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait , but a realistic one .  both crumb and flanagan revelled in their defects .  but flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs , he inflicted acts of pain on himself at a very young age , courageously defying god ( he was an irish catholic ) and turning his body into a work of art , which he unraveled in museums and lectures .  behold these works of physical art .  among them is a metal ball inserted inside his anus , and , --the most disturbing scene of the decade-- , nailing his penis to a board .  flanagan was a man of great intelligence , wit and humor , as well as adopting a sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking .  not only did he approach his disease with humor , peforming burlesque acts in front of an audience , he was also revitalized by his approachment .  most with cystic fibrosis do not make it past their earlier twenties ( there's also a subplot involving a female devotee who knew death was awaiting her .   )  but the most outstanding thing about "" sick "" is flanagan's relationship with sheree .  brimming with honesty , sensual stimulation and unapologetically sad moments of pain , their powerful bond lifts "" sick "" into a rare cinematic high , where we forget we are in an auditorium and become a part of these people .  the last scene , where we see the hero murmuring the last words to his wife in a hospital bed , as he struggles for his last moments of life , is raw , tender , hideous .  it goes a step beyond cinematic intimacy .

1|"studio expectations must not have been high for "" great expectations "" -- the film's release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute , therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999 .  it's actually a smart move , because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn't quite oscar fodder , it * is * strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year .   "" great expectations "" also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right , especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann's "" william shakespeare's romeo + juliet . ""   "" great expectations "" opens somewhere in 1970s florida ( the original story is set in 19th-century england ) , as eight-year-old finn ( jeremy james kissner ) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future .  there's icy , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beaudene ) , a pseudo-playmate of finn's ; ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , estella's auntie who's quite off-kilter over a past romance that never took off ; and a mysterious prisoner ( robert de niro ) whom finn saves the life of .  finn , who lives with his sister's affable boyfriend ( lone star's chris cooper ) , fancies himself an aspiring artist , and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms . dinsmoor's lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion .  flash forward into the '90s ( after a brief stop in the '80s ) , and finn ( now played by ethan hawke ) , despondent over a strange hot-and-cold relationship with the elusive estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor ; it's enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art .  there , finn seems to gain everything he could ever want -- wealth , prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world .  when estella resurfaces -- albeit with an aloof fianc ? ( hank azaria ) -- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction .  but she's not the only ghost from finn's past that's going to be paying him a visit .  comparisons with the afore-mentioned "" romeo + juliet "" seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting .   "" great expectations "" is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where "" romeo "" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both .  the movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki's sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that's steamier than the film's ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes .  the eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik .  acting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay's occasional slip-ups .  hawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from "" gattaca "" ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy .  paltrow's estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped .  while the actress is at her icily seductive best , we're not told very much about her character , and as a result , it's often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we don't quite understand why she's fueling his fire .  robert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft , a macabre , throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous .  alfonso cuaron's visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie's climax .  another problem is predictability ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren't familiar with the story .  despite its script flaws , though , "" great expectations "" is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy .  and frankly , it's nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality .  perhaps that renovated release date , awfully close to valentine's day , will end up helping "" great expectations "" ' seemingly average box office chances after all .

1|"seen december 28 , 1997 at 8 : 45 p . m . at the crossgates mall cinema 18 ( guilderland , ny ) , theater #8 , with matt perreault and my sister jena for free ( matt paid using pre-paid passes ) .  if there's ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non- stop action , the james bond films are it .  and if there's ever been a james bond film that not only proves this , but does so by pushing it to the extreme , "" tomorrow never dies "" is it .  opening sequences almost always make or break action films .  when done properly , not only are they actually exciting , but they foreshadow things to come .  this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie , but with a sense of the self-aware , enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in .  first there's a high-tech , slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly , chinese waters .  there's definite tension as there seems to be an unknown , but certainly hostile , third party involved who is manipulating both sides .  when the scene ends in tragedy , it's clear there's some kind of powerful conspiracy going on , and who else to call on for such a case but james bond ?  the film uses good judgment in the way it introduces us to bond ( brosnon ) .  as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious , bond is clearly ( and obviously ) depicted as an out-and-out hero .  he single-handedly takes out a small army of terrorists , and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co-pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down !  this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for ( over- ) using , but it works here because the film knows how to get our attention quickly .  it's not about the payoff because it's obvious bond will escape , instead , it's the way it processes the action sequences by going over the top and not apologizing for it , all the while creating for witty , hysterical comedy .  it seems less emphasis is placed on the villains in thrillers anymore , because of political correctness , and just plain copping-out on behalf of the filmmakers ( even the term "" villain "" sounds passe ) .  what the film deserves kudos for is its ability to create a villain as heinous as they come , yet making him seem completely plausible .  jonathon pryce delivers a perfect performance as the arrogant , cunning elliot carver , a media mogul whose goal is to take over the world , that is , through his massive media empire , not through nuclear weapons .  through some interesting detective work , bond and the english ministry of defense believe carver is behind the trouble brewing in the southern asian seas as a way to create and accurately cover his own news .  not only is that an original idea for a conflict , but one which could carry over into reality .  surprisingly , this is about as detailed as the story allows the specific plot to become .  the film's hook is the action , and of course those cool gadgets and we get plenty of that here as bond goes out to investigate carver and finds himself in a jam or two along the way .  the story works much like bond himself - always on the run and concentrates more on the individual conflicts than any general plot .  somehow a chinese agent , wai lin ( yeoh ) , bumps into bond a few too many times and they find themselves working together .  the chemistry between brosnon and yeoh is rigid , but also works because of this , not in spite of it .  the two are constantly on the run from carver and his goons , yet the film manages to balance the stunts and special effects with its clever story .  although "" tomorrow never dies "" is far from perfect , it is quite an impressive film in terms of its ability to be so cliche and cartoony and not make plausibility an issue .

1|"james jones , one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century , has written a number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual .  a veteran of world war ii , and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings , his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature .  they are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence , a trait which lends itself to razor-sharp focus .  but perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel , the thin red line ; now a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick .  the book's principal cast , some thirty characters , has been trimmed down for this rendition , but it still retains its most endearing value .  each of the roles has an everyman quality , emphasizing jones' examination of world war ii on the american soldier .  there's a definitive chain of command present , and this also plays on the motivations of the cast .  but most importantly , and perhaps intrinsic to the novel but not to the movie , a dynamic and effective voice-over is used .  malick has several characters relating their thoughts , giving the viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake .  the issues at stake are many and one .  told from a limited third-person perspective ( as opposed to a top-down , omniscient view ) , the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company ( "" c-for-charlie "" ) to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal .  the south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war .  and want to win the war they do .  in an excellent performance , nick nolte plays c-for-charlie's commanding officer , lt . col . gordon tall .  he's an aging soldier who embodies the win-at-all-costs mentality , if only to impress his superior ( john travolta , in a questionable cameo ) .  this philosophy is opposite that of captain bugger staros ( elias koteas ) , who dearly values the life of each and every one of the men under his command .  at the front are the privates and corporals ( adrien brody , james caviezel , ben chaplin , et al ) , lead by 1st sgt .  welsh ( sean penn ) , who must actually execute the suicide orders handed down to them .  the thin red line is filled with intense , visual poetry , but it's nearly three hours long .  although the interest level is high throughout the first two hours , the climax comes forty-five minutes before the end of the movie ; it goes without saying that the movie drags on the back end .  the thin red line will doubtless be compared to 1998's other masterpiece of war , saving private ryan a countless number of times .  but to do so is to belittle both films , for although similarities abound , so do differences .  director malick has a story to tell , and for those interested in listening , this can be a very outstanding movie .

1|"an energetic , visually stunning , but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d'arc .  in history jeanne d'arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy , which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors , who can basically alter the story as they wish .  she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint .  a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness .  director/writer luc besson ( 'nikita' , 'leon' ) portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft .  besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend .  he tries not to show her as a saint or a villain .  he shows her as a human being .  in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky , and the air smelled of rotten flesh , it is hard to keep your sanity .  the only support and hope is in god .  at the age of 13 , jeanne ( milla jovovich ) watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers .  this terrible event makes a lasting impact on jeanne's mind .  god is no longer her support .  he has become her obsession .  she starts seeing visions and signs that command her to raise an army and free france from the siege of the english tyranny .  with the help of the wise yolande d'aragon ( faye dunaway ) and charles vii ( john malcovich ) , whose grand royal ambitions and life are at stake , jeanne raises an army and marches towards the english walls .  after this the film stays mostly on the battlefield , where besson demonstrates his ability to direct amazing action sequences , only occasionally resorting to a calmer tempo .  the movie is filled with dreamy , symbolic images of pure artistic craftsmanship , that create a surreal and occasionally paranoiac atmosphere .  the film is lost in time and space , hysterically jumping back and forth in jeanne's thoughts , imagination and conscience .  besson's visual style permits the audience to enter the medieval age , feel the smell of fresh blood and the adrenaline pumping in your body in the heat of battle .  but the film is far from being flawless .  the script needs a lot of polishing .  except for jeanne , there are no real characters .  and although a grand star cast is assembled , their characters are nothing more than props , not more alive than the costumes that they are wearing .  as for the maiden of lorraine herself , she is portrayed as a simple girl , too small for her divine task .  in the latter part of the film , we see her as hysterical , confused and on the brink of madness , with her past purity and innocence for ever lost .  jovovich handles the part with more panache than one might expect .  but though her screen time is incredible excessive , both malcovich ( 'being john malcovich' ) and dunaway ( 'titus' ) surpass her rather overacted and simply unprofessional performance .  and even hoffman manages to breathe some life into his dreadfully small part .  besides casting jovovich , besson's only mistake is his extreme sense of patriotism that in the end ruins his so gloriously crafted painting .  there are some viscously evil englishmen that murder , pillage and betray with a smile on their faces .  and some incredibly brave and noble frenchmen , represented by the "" three musketeers "" of this story -- the brave gilles de rais ( vincent cassel ) , the wise aulon ( desmond harrington ) and the strong la hire ( richard ridings ) .  though all those actor perform well , their characters are nothing more than symbols -- banners that proclaim the glory of france .  and thus , there is no sense of realism in this film .  'the messenger' has muscles instead of brains .  there is some relief in the end , where besson lays down his armor and starts thinking .  dustin hoffman's appearance helps and the film ends elegantly and surprisingly effective with a climax worthy of praise .  jeanne's character is unlocked , but whether god was in the picture or not , is never quite explained .  was she a confused peasant girl driven by her own hunger for revenge ?  or was she truly a messenger of god ?  the film poses as many questions as answers and nothing is completely obvious .  bess o messenger' is nothing more than a fairly good film .  it is not much that you remember of it after you leave the theater .  maybe the sound , the dreamy sequences , but certainly not the dialogue .  it is an elegant and adrenaline pumping history lesson for the mtv-generation , that although presents some interesting material , works better when it's on the battlefield .

1|"i'm not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius .  when tim burton's twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it's breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure .  and when it doesn't work , it's just dull .  i'm not even sure it works more often than it doesn't , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks !  is brilliant .  mars attacks !  is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer's independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas .  but unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks !  has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it .  the big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks !  portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are .  the title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation .  the spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman's thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping .  it's so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing .  the movie lays low for the next 40 minutes .  we get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming .  but mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton .  it's a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton's just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars .  anyone who comes to mars attacks !  expecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses .  jack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer . rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr . strangelove's buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house's "" kennedy room , "" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big-haired , pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it's made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy .  sarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband .  the octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , "" they blew up congress ! ""  and plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace .  jim brown and tom jones are the film's vegas-based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president .  also on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen's everyone says i love you ) .  the real stars , of course , are the computer-generated martians , and they're fantastic .  with bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull-faces , round egg-eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante's gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton's little monsters are more inventive .  the film's raison d'etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans .  the sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons .  parents are urged to pay special attention to the pg-13 rating -- it's earned .  the special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks !  was in production long before that film's release .  cinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas's wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks !  regimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg .  cronenberg's movie will almost certainly be more somber -- it won't be released in the u . s . until early next year -- but mars attacks !  is surely a similarly elegant nightmare .  this is not a nice movie .   ( and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $70 million to make it ? )  by setting the film's final scenes in the nearly empty , holocaust-ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided , burton's invasion epic suggests that the world we've got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead .  the victims of his invasion are naive , greedy , or disastrously self-absorbed -- and a good thing , too , since the movie's wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish-fulfillment fantasy .  the surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers , who triumph by determining that the alien invaders -- the ultimate elitists -- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture .  ultimately , this messy masterpiece is the year's funniest comedy and a weird , winking affirmation of the power of the people .

( van damme is a good , dextrous athlete and fighter , but he is often upstaged . )  there are other nice touches .  stavros and quinn both want the same thing : to retire in peace with their families .  that ambition ties them together in various ways , and also humanizes them a bit .  one of the things about hk action movies is that there's always some form of human element , and that's carried over into this movie as well .  it gives weight to scenes that would otherwise be forgettable .  also good is dennis rodman , playing a weapons dealer named yaz -- a character who sticks out like a fistful of broken fingers and who is funny just standing there .  rodman is natural on screen ; he's fun to watch , especially when slinging bad guys like basketballs , and deserves to get a movie of his own , based on what's seen here : a lightweight , fast-moving entertainment that showcases all of its pieces excellently .

1|"the heartbreak kid ( reviewed on aug . 26th/1998 )  starring charles grodin , cybill sheppard , eddie albert  in "" the heartbreak kid "" , charles grodin plays one of the most unbelievably obnoxious characters i've seen on screen in a long time .  he's a guy who spends virtually the entire running time of the movie bullshitting his way from one situation to another .  i doubt he ever expressed any genuine feeling at all during the film .  as the film opens , he has just gotten married , and is on the way to miami beach for his honeymoon .  halfway there , he begins to resent his bride .  by the time he arrives at his hotel and has met the cybill sheppard character , he is ready to divorce his wife .  as played by grodin , this character is the type of person that nothing will ever be good enough for him .  the phrase "" the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence "" was practically written with him in mind .  however , if he finds something he really wants , he will pursue it for as long as it takes .  the only problem is , once he has it , he immediately loses interest .  the end of "" the heartbreak kid "" is both hilarious and sad for that very reason .  charles grodin is at his smarmy best here , and sheppard is quite appealing as the object of grodin's desire .  however , the real scene stealer is jeannie berlin , daughter of director elaine may , as grodin's whiny bride .  she owns every scene that she's in , and makes you almost want to root for what the grodin character is trying to do .   "" the heartbreak kid "" was written by neil simon and it shows .  simon loves to deconstruct and analyze human relationships , and he's at the top of his game here .  as maddeningly obnoxious as the grodin character is , he's the type of guy that everyone knows .  the character of george costanza on "" seinfeld "" seems to have been modelled after him .  the only problem with the film is that it's not that funny , and it's billed as a comedy .  as much as i could see the realism in the characters , it would have been nice to have a chuckle here and there .

1|"it's a curious thing - i've found that when willis is not called on to carry the whole movie , he's much better and so is the movie .  even though , in the sixth sense he is the "" name "" , he doesn't have the pivotal role .  that honour goes to haley osment who plays cole sear ( cute pun , seer ) a 9 year old boy who can see ghosts .  if osment was cute or precious , the director going for the maudlin , this would be nothing more than a movie-of-the-week , thankfully , osment is not only better than that , but in some instances , blows everyone else off the screen in a bravura performance .  we get to see his fears , vulnerabilities , strengths and intelligence which makes the sixth sense one of the best movies i've seen this year .  the whole cast matches him in quality , with willis giving a fairly low key performance that matches the subject matter .  one thing about this movie , its target .  this isn't a sfxfest like the haunting or a gorefest , this is more what i'd call a supernatural drama , more interested in characters than in dazzling you with makeup .  one caveat : there's a lovely twist in the movie , something like the usual suspects , where you end up replaying the movie in your head rethinking what you have just seen .  i was extremely lucky to see it as a sneak preview in toronto , before any hype or critical reviews were out , so i went in with no biases .  if anyone want to talk to about the movie before you see it , don't let them .  let the director explain on his own pace and you'll enjoy the movie vastly more .

1|"i'll be the first to admit i didn't expect much from the emperor's new groove : more celine dion-esque song-and-dance numbers , cuddly characters that become cross-promotion devices in mcdonald's happy meals , and hollywood stars trying to gain credibility by adding a voice-over job to their resume .  i was dead wrong about all of those things .  the emperor's new groove is funny .  damn funny .  and the cute characters in the film are the dangerous ones .  the script is fast and furious , with no singing and dancing .  the animation is clean and would give walt a warm feeling all over .  the humor is dry and aimed at both the cynicism and the goodness in all of us .  the story is ridiculously weird and comes off as a strange acid trip involving talking , cross-dressing llamas and schizophrenia .  here's the plot ; try to follow along .  set in a mythical kingdom , the film follows the adventures of kuzco ( david spade ) , an arrogant and egocentric emperor .  when kuzco fires his power-hungry advisor , yzma ( eartha kitt ) , she and her "" assistant "" kronk ( seinfeld's patrick warburton ) change him into a llama .  kuzco then gets stranded in the jungle and must rely on pacha ( john goodman ) , a llama-herder whose home was to be replaced by kuzco's water world theme park , to save him .  then the fun starts .  for the next sixty minutes , the audience is treated to something unheard of in disney films these days : imagination .  yzma , voiced by the talented singer eartha kitt , looks like a cross between norma desmond , joan crawford , and a really old vegas showgirl .  the dialogue between her and her oblivious assistant kronk is quick , sharp , and feels like an episode of seinfeld ( which would make sense ) .  david spade and john goodman's character interactions make you feel like you're watching an old hope/crosby film .  spade is beyond dry with his humor and shoots below the belt on several occasions , and i laughed out loud several times .  needless to say , that is an extremely rare thing in disney screenings these days .  the best part about the emperor's new groove is how audacious the film is .  the sheer weirdness factor is very high .  cross-dressing , schizophrenia , duality of soul , people being turned into every animal on noah's boat , llama cpr , homoerotic tendencies , an emperor with his own theme song and singer , michael jackson dance moves , and a guy that can communicate with a squirrel are only a few of the oddities that make the film a true orginal .  simply put , the emperor's new groove is one of the best children's films out for this holiday season .  kids will enjoy the adventures , and parents will enjoy the story and dialogue .  that's a tough thing to pull off in a single package , but this emperor manages to do it .

1|"before even seeing a single frame of the film , it would be easy to snicker at deep impact , in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet .  it is the latest entry in this decade's dubious revival of the '70s disaster film , and the first of two "" the sky is falling "" flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july's armageddon , in which a meteor is the threat ) .  its tagline , "" oceans rise .  cities fall .  hope survives "" is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight ( "" they came in alone . . . the only way out . . .  is together "" ) , but it's every bit as treacly .  the opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at .  the cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions , such as the usual opening "" roll call , "" in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced .  the most prominent of the "" personal "" stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) , who is distraught that her father ( maximilian schell ) left her mother ( vanessa redgrave ) for a younger woman ( rya kihlstedt ) .  what is just as snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration , microsoft and nbc's cable news network msnbc , which employs jenny , who is the film's ostensible main character .  in the vision of america presented here , msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home , when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country .  the initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante's peak , but there's one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder .  she won an emmy for her helming work on nbc's smash er , which is essentially a weekly disaster movie , each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises .  the challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold : ( 1 ) to make the audience care for these guest characters , regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are , and ( 2 ) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic .  having passed the "" er challenge "" in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker , leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin's rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen .  as the countdown to impact progresses , the ominous feeling of doom is palpable , leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension .  there's nothing here that will profoundly move anyone , but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects .  situations that initially feel contrived , such as jenny's familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) and comet discoverer leo biederman ( elijah wood ) , achieve some poignance ; and even the more vaguely drawn characters , including u . s . president tom beck ( morgan freeman ) , astronaut spurgeon "" fish "" tanner ( robert duvall ) , and his rather faceless crew ( ron eldard , jon favreau , mary mccormack , blair underwood , and alexander baluyev ) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft messiah , have their share of touching moments .  the latter fact owes a debt to the actors , who all do a solid job and are well-cast , with the possible exception of leoni ; she delivers a decent performance , but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster .  although its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work ( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular ) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister , it is the first of the '90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact , even if it isn't as deep as hoped .

1|"i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate , cuba's oscar nominee for best foreign film , directed by tomas gutierrez alea ( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo-- "" memories of underdevelopment "" .  i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late '70s ; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition .  i knew then that memorias was probably a state-sanctioned political missive , and now expect strawberry will follow suit .  fellow internetters , primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba ( soc . culture . cuba ) , have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs .  i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line--it probably looks like political criticism , but it ain't so .  having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro's repressiveness , i can't conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution , and i can't imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement .  as kids say these days , duh ! , the revolution's current state needs no criticism ; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident .  the proper questions to put relate to castro's legitimacy .  i bet the film takes castro's power for granted , and that this or any other movie , produced under cuba's state control , cannot question his right to run cuba's political show ( ongoing now for more than 36 years ) .  that's why i just can't believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime .  let's see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up .  i saw the film--twice .  i was right ; castro remained intact .  strawberry negotiates the relationship between a young "" dialectic materialist , "" as he describes himself , and a homosexual photographer ( diego ) in 1979 cuba .  the young man ( david ) is the son of peasants ; a symbol of the revolution's reason for being .  grateful to the revolution for the opportunity to receive a university education , he studies political science instead of literature , his avocation , because he perceives it is his duty .  therein lies a likely unintended irony , since cuba has no need for political theoreticians .  cuba's government is castro .  diego's lifestyle is the antithesis of revolutionary life .  he enjoys the finer things--tea , opera , art .  he does not do "" voluntary work "" for the revolution .  his small apartment is a sensual oasis .  the moniker "" bourgeois "" figuratively hangs over his head during the early parts of the movie .  however , he is a "" revolucionario "" in his own way .  the supporting roles are filled by : an aging busybody with a heart of gold and a troubled psyche ; david's roommate , who rally takes the communist party line to its expected extreme ; david's ex-girlfriend , who dumped him for another guy , yet wants to bed him before she leaves for italy with her husband ; german , a gay sculptor whose work diego is attempting to exhibit , and who strikes a faustian pact with the government .  gutierrez alea and co-director juan carlos tabio do a fine job at almost showing that homosexuals can be revolutionaries too .  heck , towards the end of the film you begin to think the guy deserves a medal for his patriotic fervor .  he really loves the revolution ( as supposedly does everybody else in cuba ) and wants to make it better by exposing and correcting some of its flaws .  real criticism is missing though .  this movie is political window dressing .  luis aguilar leon's op .  ed .  piece on fresa in the miami herald ( 10 march 1995 , at 21a ) did not color my judgment ; it presaged my intuition .  aguilar leon expressed my sentiment about this film's political angle best : like many artistic manifestations in cuba , strawberry and chocolate sprang from a totally manipulated environment .  as art critic ivan de la nuez well states in the latest issue of the magazine postmodern notes , the silenced artists are those who refuse to accept "" the charade in which artists can provoke up to a point , while the institutions legitimize themselves by forbidding them to go beyond that point .

1|"capsule : this is a 1950s or 1960s style heist film , set in the present .  robert deniro stars as a risk-adverse safecracker who wants to retire form crime but takes one last job at the request of a personal friend ( played by marlon brando ) .  edward norton plays a hotshot young sharpster who is also in on the crime .  the plot is mostly straightforward suspense with little nonsense .   , +2 ( -4 to +4 )  i am sure i must have seen almost the identical plot before .  this is a heist film made for an adult audience who probably wanted a crime film like they had seen in theaters when they were teens .  there are no superhuman acrobats taking nosedives off of buildings like in entrapment .  there is no rock score .  there are no ballet- like martial arts .  this is just a basic heist film with a decent and distinctly credible and un-flashy script .  nick ( played by robert deniro ) is a safecracker who has managed to be successful by never taking risks .  if a job is not a safe bet ( pun intended ) , he backs out .  sometimes even the safe bets turn out not to be so safe .  when one job very nearly goes wrong nick is unnerved enough to decide that it is nature telling him that it is time to get out of the game .  he returns to his home in montreal where he owns a jazz club , and decides to manage it full time .  he proposes to his girl friend diane ( angela bassett ) .  she has one condition .  he must stay retired from crime .  but before the deal can be cemented , max , a montreal kingpin and personal friend , has one last supposedly easy job for nick .  nick wants no part particularly because the heist will be right in his hometown of montreal .  more and more details seem to complicate the job .  nick's partner in the crime is to be a smart , but uncontrollable young crook , jack ( edward norton ) .  jack treats a locked front door like a welcome mat , even at his associates' homes .  the young crook is a know-it-all who seems good at everything he does but at avoiding rubbing people the wrong way .  together they plan to steal a priceless historic artifact from the montreal customs house .  the script by kario salem , lem dobbs , and scott marshall smith works like an episode of the old "" mission impossible "" television series .  we see pieces of the heist being put together , last minute changes , and things that go wrong , much like a good episode of "" mission impossible . ""  this team might not be bad choices to write scripts for the tom cruise "" mission impossible "" films .  the complications are , however no more and no fewer than are needed to make the story believable .  the telling is cold and noirish , which is just what it is supposed to be .  director frank oz , the voices of yoda and miss piggy proves surprisingly good at directing a serious crime film .  the score has a more than adequate cast with little flashy or scene-stealing acting .  edward norton probably has the flashiest role and even that is low-key by today's standards .  he plays what is nearly a double role .  jack pretends to be a brain damage victim to be hired for a job in the customs house .  one nice ( ? )  character i have not mentioned is stephen ( jamie harrold ) .  stephen is a master hacker who lives in his mother's basement in a house with a lot of screaming in both directions .  he seems like the last person the risk adverse nick would want to depend upon .  the film itself remains low-key up until the time of the climactic heist .  then the pace really picks up .  before that the plot even stops twice for jazz interludes .  though oz never lets the music steal time from the story the way woody allen does in sweet and lowdown .  on the subject of music , the score of the score is by howard shore .  it adds tension to the suspense scenes , but never seems to have much of a melody .  angela bassett is the one misused celebrity in a totally minor role that should have been played by a less famous actress who needed a break .  she has nothing to do in the film but demand that nick give up crime and to look like an attractive reward if he does .  speaking of being attractive the score seems to be attracting an older audience who learned to appreciate much the same sort of film in the 1950s and 1960s .  it does the job .  i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .

1|getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity .  the film was directed by randal kleiser , who brought us such bubble-gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon .  but thanks to kleiser's surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script , getting it right is a pleasantly quiet , moving , and memorable film--one geared strictly toward a sophisticated , adult audience .  getting it right stars jesse birdsall ( emily lloyd's boyfriend in wish you were here ) as gavin , a painfully shy 31-year-old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who--gasp--is still a virgin .  gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon , but expose him to a single 30-year-old beauty and he's a mess .  much to gavin's surprise , the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan ( lynn redgrave ) , a rich , married , and lonely 45-year-old .  getting it right is the simple story of gavin's awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right ; that is , to find the right woman to fulfill his life .  getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in-depth character development .  gavin's self-conscious voice-over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche .  we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self-confident maturity .  birdsall's superb , understated performance as gavin is the real backbone of the film ; he seems convincing and authentic throughout .  the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin's life .  despite her limited screen time , redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin's middle-aged seducer .  for a supporting character , joan is unusually and impressively complex , thanks in large part to redgrave's magnificent performance .  gavin is also pursued , or perhaps plagued , by minnie , the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat .  after minnie and gavin meet at a party , she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life .  helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role , and sir john gielgud , with his tongue in his cheek , embodies the height of arrogance as her father .  gavin's eventual love-interest is jenny , the adorable twenty-year-old single mother who assists him at the beauty salon ; london stage actress jane horrocks' fine performance yields a touchingly sweet character .  peter cook , the great british satirist , appears briefly in the film as gavin's uptight employer .  the scenes of gavin's home life with his parents are also a treat .  gavin's over-protective mother ( pat heywood ) , whom even woody allen would find overbearing , almost steals the movie .  her life seems limited to just two activities : treating gavin like a 10-year-old and preparing exotic but inedible meals , such as scalding hot curry and baked chicken with chocolate sauce .  gavin and his father's attempts to avoid eating her meals are extremely amusing .  getting it right , for the most part , is very well-crafted , except for two minor shortcomings .  first , the movie is about 15 minutes too long , and consequently it loses momentum at times .  second , the film includes an altogether extraneous subplot about the domestic problems between gavin's best friend , harry , and his unfaithful lover , winthrop .  overall , however , getting it right is quite memorable for its humor , depth , sophistication , and outstanding acting .  director kleiser and screenwriter elizabeth jane howard ( adapting her own highly acclaimed novel ) deserve praise for finding just the right tone for this tale of growth , maturation , and self-discovery .  |0.6973333333333332|0.8500000000000001|0.8333333333333334|The film is highly praised for its positive aspects, including direction, script, character development, and acting.

1|"no matter what you suspect , this isn't your usual action thriller .  the usual suspects is an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer .  it's one of those movies that , after everything is revealed rapid-fire at the end , you immediately want to rewind and watch again because earlier scenes take on a new light .  plot twists a-go-go are what you get here -- i gave up trying to figure out the mystery of keyser soze after awhile and just sat back and waited for them to reveal it to me .  keyser soze is a name you'll hear at least a hundred times if you watch the usual suspects and for good reason .  it's not only the name of the mysterious ( and possibly even mythical ) crime boss in the movie , it also sums up the movie -- "" keyser soze "" in latin means "" an intelligent crime mystery story from up-and-coming director bryan singer . ""  or maybe i shouldn't have bought a foreign-language dictionary from the same company that makes those 99-cent encyclopedias sold in supermarkets .  at the movie's opening , a group of known criminals are brought in for a police lineup , including mcmanus ( stephen baldwin ) , keaton ( gabriel byrne ) , fenster ( benicio del toro ) , buckney ( kevin pollack ) and verbal ( kevin spacey , winner of the best supporting actor academy award{symbol 153 \ f "" times new roman "" \ s 10 \ h} for his performance in the movie ) .  verbal is so-named because he frequently rambles on about anything or nothing .  he also earns his name as the movie's narrator , spouting memorable lines like "" the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist "" ( although , obviously , he does exist -- what else could explain kris kross having a comeback in 1996 ? ) while being interrogated by police detective chazz palminteri ( any actor with multiple z's in their name is okay in my book ) .  we see the story unfold as spacey retells it .  the five felons , upon being released from the lineup , get their revenge on the police by exposing a corrupt taxi service -- whereby elite criminals pay to be smuggled through town in cop cars -- and stealing all the money and drugs in the car .  it's a definite case of male bonding for the five criminals , who later find out they were brought together by the unseen keyser soze , who sends a minion to them with an offer they can't refuse .  namely , they have to destroy soze's main competitors in organized crime by infiltrating a ship , shooting a bunch of people , burning all the drugs and stealing $91 million cash .  spacey does a terrific job of bringing his seemingly unintelligent "" cripple "" character to life and baldwin , byrne , palminteri and the rest make for a good supporting cast .  the usual suspects is one of those movies that deftly mixes scenes of violence and explosions with an underlying sense of mystery and suspense , keeping the viewer guessing until the very end -- and then still leaving a few details open for scrutiny and discussion .  i suppose all that would be cleared up if i really had rewound the movie and watched it again instead of changing the channel and wondering in disbelief what the hell kris kross was doing on mtv .  a different mystery , i guess , which may turn into a _murder_ mystery if that video ever comes on again . . .

1|" "" dangerous beauty "" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583 .  it is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness .  dealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff .  the director , marshall herskovitz , doesn't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation .  the film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe .  at this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce .  the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived .  however , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment .  the story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy ) .  unfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn't get in .  veronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider .  after a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her .  however , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco's world , albeit not as his wife .  she decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite .  a courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied .  at one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants .  veronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself .  once she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well .  she is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco .  their relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco's advances .  in many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love .   "" love the love , not the man , "" as her mother told her .   "" dangerous beauty , "" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice .  it has multiple plot lines -- including veronica's adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france's military assistance in venice's battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing .  much of the film's success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role .  known chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson's ire in "" braveheart "" ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady .  she has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes .  the rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in "" dark city "" have assured him a solid place in hollywood .  he has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas .  oliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy .  platt is a good actor , but he's just too hard to hate .  jacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco's uncle .   "" dangerous beauty "" is marshall herskovitz's sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film "" jack the bear . ""  partnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( "" thirtysomething , "" "" my so-called life "" ) and in the movies ( "" legends of the fall "" ) .  his directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions .  he could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids .   "" dangerous beauty "" contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative .  herskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller "" kalifornia "" ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara's dark sci-fi film "" body snatchers "" ( 1994 ) .  bazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery .  however , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( "" brazil , "" "" the princess bride "" ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( "" the age of innocence "" ) .  the only problem with "" dangerous beauty "" is that it doesn't stick with you .  it's a good story well-told with interesting characters , but it's easy to shrug off once you've left the theater .  the only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it's simply too melodramatic and conventional .  herskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter , but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion , and like the rest of the film , it carries no real weight , despite the potential severity of the subject matter .

1|imagine this scenario : you and any of your family members are scudding through one of those long , excruciating cross-country car trips , far from the city and into the deserted rural routes .  so far , the trip is idyllic when , abruptly , your car malfunctions and you are stranded in the middle of nowhere .  it is not an easy situation , but a perfectly plausible one , the panorama in which breakdown musters it's throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness .  it is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays , but breakdown doesn't bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful , titillating climax that by it's finale , engrosses a viewer with total absorption .  the plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988's the vanishing .  kurt russell and kathleen quinlan respectively play jeff and amy taylor , a massachusetts couple en route to california for a brand new job .  when they stop for gas somewhere in the arid southwest , jeff is confronted by a pugnacious driver , who later , will be an important player in the plot department .  minutes later after that , their brand new , strikingly red , jeep grand cherokee unexpectedly stops .  jeff cannot detect the car's problem , so he allows amy to take a ride with red ( j .  t walsh ) , a heedful truck driver who will convey her to the nearest town , where jeff will meet her at a local diner .  it is facile for the film to turn into a pseudo-suspenser , but instead it opts for maximum fervor .  jeff manages to re-start the car himself , but when he arrives at the diner , she is nowhere in sight .  disconcerted , the coffee shop's bartender informs jeff where to search for his wife , a town about twenty miles from here .  there , trouble arises .  and i shall not reveal anything else , since that would be spoiling the fun of what's head .  there are many involving , tight scenes in breakdown but the final climactic period which includes a magnificent chase with three cars and a huge truck , will have you feeling as if your legs are made out of pure foam .  it is a pleasure to be part of a classic confrontation of good vs evil , and rooting for the good guys , in this case jeff .  kurt russell is one of the few top-notch hollywood actors which doesn't overblow his acting , and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses .  so you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter-perfect .  suffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation , from a jolly man , to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one .  not many well-paid actors can deliver these type of performances , but russell is one of them .  as an everyday man , he pulls it off extremely convincingly , what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality , which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes .  although the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences ( very well done ) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with .  faced with an enigma about his wife's whereabouts , the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters , including the cryptic villains , who in essence , make the movie what it is .  what's most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow .  mostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair .  contrary to most american thrillers , he doesn't rely on visual flair , but on aesthetics and substance .  after breakdown , he should gain vast notoriety .  the villains in the movie aren't your routine out-of-this-world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective .  the baddies in breakdown , all well acted , are normal , seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer , conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder .  the movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks , and , of all things in the world , it is becoming rather easy to root for villains ( jon voight in anaconda ) in today's movies .  worth a special mentioning is j . t walsh ( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision ) as the leader of the gang , he renders a deliciously wicked performance , temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for .  alfred hitchcock used suspense--and action-- not only to stimulate , but as a way of aiding his audience's fascination in his stories , which were slowly realizing man's biggest fears .  breakdown yields exactly that .  it magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man , acting like an ordinary man , looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero .  despite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock , i think , would approve of breakdown .

1|"steve soderbergh's "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" which won the grand prize at the cannes film festival in 1989 , arguably began the resurgence of independent films .  made on a shoestring budget of $1 . 2 million , with then relatively unknown actors , it is a provocative , thoroughly original drama .  the film mostly focuses on the four central characters , all in their late 20's-early 30's .  ann ( andie macdowell ) , an unfulfilled housewife , is married to john ( peter gallagher ) , an insensitive lawyer , who , unbeknownst to her , is having an affair with her younger sister , cynthia ( laura san giacomo ) .  complicating matters even worse is graham ( james spader , who won best actor at cannes ) , john's old college buddy , who comes to stay at their house .  ann is absolutely won over by him , even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex .  that is the set-up for the last hour of the picture , and since the film is entitled , "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise .  director steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker , ranging from the independent , to the mainstream ( 1998's "" out of sight "" ) , to the downright kafkaesque ( 1997's "" schizopolis "" ) .  he is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances , and believes in the work that he does , and , "" sex , lies , and videotape , "" is probably his most confident , and maybe even best , to date .  the performances are superb from all four leads , but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character .  she is always a very winning actress , but this is probably her most three-dimensional role that she has had ( with a close second being altman's 1993 mosaic , "" short cuts "" ) .  the other parts are perfectly cast as well , from spader's ominous graham , to gallagher's self-involved john , to giacomo's outspoken cynthia .  the final act of the film , especially , comes right out of left field , and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching , and it would be criminal to give away the film's secrets .  suffice to say that , through one powerful sequence , ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell , and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty , as well as deception .  the film has one fault , however .  the characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another , and often unlikable .  if there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher , it probably would have helped , since his relationship with macdowell isn't quite as explored as i would have liked .

1|"synopsis : private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband .  after uncovering the authenticity of the film , welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers .  comments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time .  though it doesn't present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person's murder for real , usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as , say , natural born killers , 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it .  it is not fun to watch ; see something else if you get upset by realistic , sadistic violence .  this film's violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory .  for those with strong stomachs , however , 8 mm is an intelligent , worthwhile thriller , especially during its second hour .  nicolas cage , after a couple ho-hum movies , returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities .  as tom welles , a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly-born daughter , cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants .  serving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix , who plays a struggling songwriter named max california .  california , despite his name , is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character , and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character .  the real star of the movie , though , must be peter stormare .  stormare played the "" really , really evil guy "" in fargo , and his character , dino velvet , in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable .  his performance is very chilling .  8 mm's success may hardly be surprising .  it was directed by joel schumacher , who , hopefully , saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin .  before directing the last two batman duds , however , schumacher was responsible for several well-made horror flicks : lost boys , flatliners , and falling down .  8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self-destructs before the audience's eyes .  8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker , who also penned the academy award-winning thriller seven a few years back .  like seven , 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater .  welles is searching for answers .  how could anyone possibly drug and then slowly , methodically , sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film ?  when confronting one of the perpretrators at the end , the murderer responds that there are no reasons .  he just enjoys it .  that , walker seems to suggest , is where the real terror lays : not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist .  a couple minor faults led me to my four-star rating ( five stars is the highest rating i give ) .  one , i found it a little difficult , early on , to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film .  yes , snuff is a horrible thing , but a detective of welles' caliber has probably encountered awful things before .  second , some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient .  he discovers , for example , the victim's diary in her private bathroom , despite the fact the the police , the fbi , and her own mother have all investigated the room before .  finally , the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film .  despite the above criticisms , 8 mm is an engrossing story .  one of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles , who no longer seems like a hero , brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film .  he pulls a gun on the man and , for a relatively long amount of time , struggles to decide whether or not to kill him .  he then leaves the building and calls the victim's mother , in the middle of the night , to basically see if she would support the action .  the entire scene is tense , unpredictable , and emotionally charged .  rarely , anymore , do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm , with scenes like this , did .  8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart .  this is a graphic , oftentimes unflinching , look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people .  if you're prepared for a film of this nature , i give it an enthusiastic recommendation .

1|to me , nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film .  despite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed , the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence .  ever since the big success of the action-thriller `face/off' in 1997 , the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr . cage .  the perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films .  `8mm' was a disappointing lost cause .  but who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity , which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead' .  cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce , a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day .  after five years of the stress-inducing job , frank basically just staggers onward , relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends .  he also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care , namely a young girl named rose , who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york .  frank desperately wants to be fired , but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need ( `i'll fire you tomorrow . . . ' he promises ) .  frank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance .  the first is larry ( john goodman ) , who always has food on the brain .  the second is marcus ( ving rhames ) , a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation .  and finally , tom ( tom sizemore ) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood .  i found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank , but they never figured into the actual plot .  each is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank's character , because `bringing out the dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality .  the one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary ( patricia arquette ) , the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack .  arquette , who recently received the wounds of christ in `stigmata' , performs well around real-life husband cage .  it's unfortunate that , after such intriguing character trials and tribulations , the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled , ineffective finale .  the movie belongs to the one-two punch of cage and scorsese , who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to `bringing out the dead' .  although it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like `goodfellas' , scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture .  the incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration .  fans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive , darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `kundun' .  does `bringing out the dead' rival scorsese's finest work ?  only occasionally .  some of the film feels surprisingly limp , but there is enough energy in it's interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice .  those expecting a grisly , risqu ? product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight-arrow approach - but it's still a solid , admirable effort .  `bringing out the dead' was written by the acclaimed paul schrader , who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as `taxi driver' and `raging bull' .  schrader's script is full of moments - wonderful , sharply defined moments - that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay .  the exceptional aspects of the film are it's astounding technical credits and the amazing cast .  goodman and sizemore are both electric ( well , mainly sizemore ) , but it's the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look .  watch the actor's deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member , and you'll understand why he won a golden globe .  `bringing out the dead' is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it's certain flaws .  scorsese - and cage , for that matter - have done better , but their intentions are certainly admirable .  |0.41|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|"Overall, the sentiment of the explanations is slightly positive, with praise for Nicolas Cage's acting skills, his performance in ""Bringing Out the Dead,"" and Martin Scorsese's direction and technical aspects of the film.
