1|"films adapted from comic books have had plenty of success , whether they're about superheroes ( batman , superman , spawn ) , or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world ) , but there's never really been a comic book like from hell before .  for starters , it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell ) , who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid '80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .  to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .  the book ( or "" graphic novel , "" if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .  in other words , don't dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing , you might find another stumbling block in from hell's directors , albert and allen hughes .  getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in , well , anything , but riddle me this : who better to direct a film that's set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?  the ghetto in question is , of course , whitechapel in 1888 london's east end .  it's a filthy , sooty place where the whores ( called "" unfortunates "" ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .  when the first stiff turns up , copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane , the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp , blow ) to crack the case .  abberline , a widower , has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium .  upon arriving in whitechapel , he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham , say it isn't so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon can't stomach .  i don't think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper , so i won't go into the particulars here , other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .  in the comic , they don't bother cloaking the identity of the ripper , but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .  it's funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because , after all , an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .  and from hell's ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days ( "" who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ? "" ) .  don't worry - it'll all make sense when you see it .  now onto from hell's appearance : it's certainly dark and bleak enough , and it's surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times , it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .  the print i saw wasn't completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized , so no comments about marilyn manson ) , but cinematographer peter deming ( don't say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks , even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic .  oscar winner martin childs' ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .  even the acting in from hell is solid , with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent .  ians holm ( joe gould's secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles , but the big surprise here is graham .  i cringed the first time she opened her mouth , imagining her attempt at an irish accent , but it actually wasn't half bad .  the film , however , is all good .  2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore , sexuality , language and drug content  "|0.6333333333333333|0.9|0.8000000000000002|"The overall sentiment is positive as the author praises the success of comic book adaptations, highlights the uniqueness of ""From Hell,"" and commends the appearance, acting, and overall quality of the film.

1|"every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody's surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling .  mtv films' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example .  did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ?  the plot is deceptively simple .  george washington carver high school is having student elections .  tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high .  mr . "" m "" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run .  and paul's nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons .  the dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be .  you can't help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have .  _election , a good film , does not live up to its hype .  what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier .  the similarities are staggering :  tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play .  max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play .  the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student .  the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student .  tracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive .  max fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive .  the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined .  he even gets a bee sting .  the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined .  he gets several bee stings .  and so on .  what happened ?  how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn't been fully formed yet ?  even so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul's anti-social sister , tammy .  broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he's had since then .  witherspoon is a revelation .  it's early in the year , it's a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination .  and once campbell's character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you're won over .  one thing that's been bothering me since i've seen it .  there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film .  i suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . .  but the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom .  as the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story .  it is bad enough that mr . m doesn't like tracy's determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ?  even so , there's no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does .  there's a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment .

1|you've got mail works alot better than it deserves to .  in order to make the film a success , all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars , have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits .  no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it's body ( it's basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner , only adding a few modern twists ) .  essentially , it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking .  it's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy , not to mention very manipulative .  but oh , how enjoyable that manipulation is .  but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does , because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming , sleepless in seattle .  it couldn't have been the directing , because both films were helmed by the same woman .  i haven't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you've got mail , but then again , is that really important ?  if you like something so much , why even question it ?  again , the storyline is as cliched as they come .  tom hanks plays joe fox , the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley , the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run children's book shop called , in a nice homage , the shop around the corner .  fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business .  little do they know , they are already in love with each other over the internet , only neither party knows the other person's true identity .  the rest of the story isn't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen .  sure , there are some mildly interesting subplots , but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship .  all of this , of course , leads up to the predictable climax .  but as foreseeable as the ending is , it's so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does .  when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love , i was filled with such , for lack of a better word , happiness that for the first time all year , i actually left the theater smiling .  |-0.3833333333333333|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is negative, with criticism towards the lack of originality, good filmmaking concepts, acting, and manipulative elements in the movie ""You've Got Mail"".

1|" "" jaws "" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen .  the movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds .  then it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score .  dah-dum .  from there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly .  right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once "" jaws "" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip .  perhaps what is most outstanding about "" jaws "" is how spielberg builds the movie .  he works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act .  unlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act .  until then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music .  he's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying .  he doesn't let us get bored with the imagery .  the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years .  the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money .  brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute .  hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( "" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine "" ) make it that much more terrifying .  when vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark .  the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it .   "" jaws "" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror .  it is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by "" star wars "" ) .  even today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's "" psycho , "" and it never seems to age .  although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill .  the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects .  scheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time "" jaws "" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman .  nevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark .  scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town .   "" it's your first summer here , you know , "" mayor vaughn warns him .  dreyfuss , who had previously been seen in "" american graffiti "" ( 1973 ) and "" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz "" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers .  however , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards .  bordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism .  he's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature .  however , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars .  quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s .  indianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese .  his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen .  shaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film .  of course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature .  a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in "" jaws , "" and they are a threat .  every one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into .  the shark in "" jaws "" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed "" bruce "" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles .  many have forgotten , but "" jaws "" was a sort of precursor to "" waterworld "" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb .  but , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .

1|"moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- you've got to know how to allocate your resources .  every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers .  in the nfl , this leads to teams like the detroit lions , who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract , but can only field five guys named herb to block for him .  in the movies , you end up with films like "" spawn "" , with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors .  jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking .  he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line .  watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid , fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars , is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit , except that sanders doesn't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages .  but like the lions star , jackie doesn't have anybody to block for him .  almost every cent that's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts , and as chan does his own stunts , the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills .  this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs ) , scripts and dubbing and supporting characters , not to mention the hideous title sequence .  this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain .   ( chan's first release in this country , "" rumble in the bronx "" , was supposedly set in new york , but was filmed in vancouver , and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . )  heck , jackie doesn't even have enough money for a haircut , looks like , much less a personal hairstylist .  in condor , chan plays the same character he's always played , himself , a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen , a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu .  jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert , and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) .  he is joined by three women , who have little to do except scream , "" jackie , save us ! "" , and misuse firearms .  the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere , and he's more pathetic than evil .  en route , we have an extended motorcycle chase scene , a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis , and two confrontations with savage natives .  once at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that's even better than the one in face/off .  this is where the money was spent , on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences , on giant kevlar hamster balls , on smashed-up crates of bananas , and on scorpions .  ignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how , exactly , if the villain's legs were broken , did he escape from the secret nazi base , and why didn't he take the key with him ? ) .  don't worry about the production values , or what , exactly , the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara .  just go see the movie .  operation condor has pretentions of being a "" raiders of the lost ark "" knockoff , but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay , a john williams score , spielberg directing and george lucas producing , condor might be an a+ movie .  however , you've got to go with what you've got , and what you've got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should , could , and ought to utilize .

1|"on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo .  two months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides .  this little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in "" lumumba . ""  patrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , "" lumumba - death of a prophet , "" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject .  peck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader .  we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men .  images of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image .  jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo .  a third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader .  his small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville .  at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc .  as the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) .  the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more .  lumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government .  his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination .  the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad .  this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries .  peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's .   ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them .  some colonial masters were better than others . )  the effort involved in "" lumumba "" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all .  production values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget .  the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique .  the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life .  the political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches .  it concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona .  the family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child .  i know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba .  the story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it .  high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character .  the actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions .  in true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead .   "" lumumba "" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both .  it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i've seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ .

1|apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether .  i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce .  as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton .  it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star .  norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year .  he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) .  the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car .  we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny .  in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother .  much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy .  when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things .  what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms .  it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material .  because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic .  i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart .  the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men .  it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up .  of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part .  it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest .  in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease .  even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead .  what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny .  the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien .  visually , the film is very powerful .  kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere .  but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes .  although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed .  for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way .  it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film .  perhaps this last scene was the problem .  it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way .  |0.35000000000000003|0.8166666666666668|0.8333333333333334|"The film ""American History X"" receives a generally positive sentiment, with praise for Edward Norton's performance and the film's intelligent portrayal of racism.

1|"one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding .  and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it .  her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 .  but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film .  and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life .  written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor .  alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare .  as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting .  walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob .  ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain .  she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits .  she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown .  and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance .  thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters .  the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family .  ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister .  walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious .  when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , "" money versus values . ""  ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises .  sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body .  it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight .  lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry .  lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot .  and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure .  lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off .  i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed .  the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia .  joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) .  alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet .  the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it .  as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful .  and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy .

1|"after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo .  their officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo's army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals .  with unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country's resources , proclaimed secession .  lumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification  tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) , but it was too late .

1|the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats .  it's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea .  sometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other .  quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem .  but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors .  flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists .  mostly it's laughable .  in hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form .  but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right .  iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry .  but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) .  unlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression .  iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth .  iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger .  however , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox .  in those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience .  while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune .  aka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau .  |-0.2333333333333333|0.8333333333333334|0.7666666666666666|"The sentiment of the explanations is slightly negative, as they critique Hollywood's attempts to replicate the success of Asian action films and mock the use of Asian-inspired stunt choreography, although there are positive mentions of quality action films like ""The Matrix"" and ""Iron Monkey."""
1|"after watching "" rat race "" last week , i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that , when not laughing aloud , i had held a grin for virtually all of the film's 112 minutes .  saturday night , i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didn't enjoy it as much the second time as the first .   "" rat race "" is a great goofy delight , a dandy mix of energetic performances , inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness .  hands down , this is the most fun film of the summer .  the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a '60s slapstick comedy , featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen .  then comes the setup .  donald sinclair ( john cleese ) , the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas , enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients .  to that end , he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines .  gathering together the lucky token holders , he explains , "" today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six . ""  the competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city , n . m . , containing $2 million in cash .  there is a transmitter in every key , so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead .  the race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money .  since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes , let's use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers .  decked out in flashy , trashy clothing and sporting big hair , vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby .  she finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite , conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life .  thrown together , it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature .  owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america .  an nfl referee , he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game .  after escaping from a vengeful cab driver , owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention .  mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful , odd little italian man on holiday in america .  he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times .  pollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight ) , a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation .  randy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas .  fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race , he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview .  beverly insists the family stay together , so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert .  brothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young , crooked and stupid .  blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing , and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him .  the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal .  finally , nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey .  at first glance , they seem blandly wholesome , but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman .  director jerry zucker ( "" airplane , "" "" ghost "" ) leaps from racer to racer , periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas ) , his personality-impaired right hand man , continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers .  as with any zucker production , a few jokes fall flat , but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps .  high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally , with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off .  had i been part of the filmmaking team , i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a baby's clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron .  it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation .  i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence .  my god , do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing "" all star ? ""  but enough carping .   "" rat race "" is a riot , with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast .  see it , see it again and when the dvd comes out , buy it , because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for .

1|"i've noticed something lately that i've never thought of before .  pseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films .  have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed , then when you look back , you realize there was something missing ?  more and more , filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed , melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film , but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience , you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff .  i'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad .  it had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered .  somehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography .  the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment .  but for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time .  nicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life .  meg ryan , in her most subdued performance yet , plays maggie , a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive .  after losing a patient on the surgery table , these questions envelope maggie , and seth , the angel who was there to oversee the patient's transition into the afterlife , is immediately captivated by the doctor .  he begins following and observing maggie , falling more and more in love with her everyday .  angels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire .  seth's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community .  the angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness .  cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once .  it's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire .  the two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual "" intelligently ditzy "" romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy .  but even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye .  it's a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn't know quite how to get to it .  they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high .  filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths .  based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending .  most movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized .  nonetheless , city of angels is beautifully captivating , which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories .

1|synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners .  cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves .  technically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave .  lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men .  three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery .  a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters .  opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life .  in fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion .  real life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved .  spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story .  djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances .  |0.4666666666666666|0.7666666666666666|0.7666666666666666|"The sentiment of the text is slightly positive, as it praises Steven Spielberg as a ""finest director,"" highlights the visually spicy and historically accurate nature of the movie, and commends the performances of Djimon Hounsou and Anthony Hopkins.

1|"the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do .  lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice .  the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower .  most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants .  it takes a pretty smart person to do that .  but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ?  what if he's also able to think on his feet ?  in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ?  it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator .  in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force .  when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder .  faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office .  i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but . . . "" ,  although it wouldn't surprise me if he did .  luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above .  after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t .  walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed .  although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue .  jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman .  the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats .  the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence .  how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ?  unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability .  almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back .  when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course .  his is an interesting character .  made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation .   "" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says .  when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be .  soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail .  this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor .  as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely .  gray really lucked out with this cast .  david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey .  the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a .  in l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land .  with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven .  also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides .  his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything .  fortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout .  j . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances .  sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film .  walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon .  for one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton .  when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) .  the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing .  in the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality .  we're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best .  as an audience , we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film .  both provide some pretty good entertainment .

""  bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself .  there are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work ( at the railway station ) .  sid james' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home .  he has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him !  the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital's pills with panic ensuing .  there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous 'matron's' .  williams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn't given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all .  the same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in .  by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters .  this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored !

1|"the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry .  based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script .  the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public .  elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order .  however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws .  the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes .  the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws .  the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl .  from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard .  right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs .  this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced .  i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone .  the film only gets better from this point .  with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats .  they walk in unison and they only look forward .  as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens .  holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films .  one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world .  wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless .   "" the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film .  the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army .  each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others .  elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film .  he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be .  however , as the film develops so does ness .  his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side .  he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends .  his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in .  sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables .  malone acts as a mentor to ness .  he teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun .  connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed .  andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer .  as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him .  charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone .  smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film .  the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen .  also very similar to "" the matrix , "" they are exciting and intense .  >from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed .  the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement .  its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors .  the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .  although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action .  some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid .

""  the philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want 'em to be taken seriously , make 'em do drugs .   "" permanent midnight "" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit .  a habit , in stahl's own words , "" the size of utah . ""  as stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance .  unlike "" trainspotting , "" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , "" permanent midnight "" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance .  one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to "" naked lunch "" author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , "" so i can shave . ""  stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in "" permanent midnight "" ; it's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills .  while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed .   "" permanent midnight "" shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author's words-- "" escape the drug scene "" ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you'd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings .  stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown's own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time .  janeane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that's stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor .  stiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top .  the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see "" permanent midnight "" ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living .

1|one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction .  the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun .  sometimes the stories are compelling .  sometimes they're not .  but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions .  star trek : insurrection is no exception .  the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why .  it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film .  some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film .  others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring .  i simply enjoyed the film .  insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet .  of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f .  murray abraham ) , to mess everything up .  the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying .  that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) .  so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat .  when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode .  this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it .  insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters .  stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together .  jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy .  frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action .  this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look .  if i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so .  i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands .  better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ?  insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience .  with it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this .  i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle .  |0.15|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment of the explanations leans towards positivity, with some mentioning enjoyment of the exciting and engaging nature of Star Trek: Insurrection and praising its special effects.

1|"call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul .  the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman , ralph fiennes , anthony hopkins , morgan freeman .  you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds , that the characters they play are real human beings .  we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes .  in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry .  shakur and roth play ezekiel "" spoon "" whitmore and alexander "" stretch "" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) .  when a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time .  they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done .  as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape .  the government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) .  in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year's day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all .  gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles .  in falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ; in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center .  and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation .  one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question , "" do you expect the world to stop . . . just  because you picked _today_ to clean up ? ""  the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time .  hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them .  a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments .  in one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures .  the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time .  hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior .  oh , the irony of it .  tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up .  in gridlock'd , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him .  spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction .  mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta .  it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy .  gridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch "" helping "" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him .  with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much .  the tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again .
