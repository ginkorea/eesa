1|"it is simply amazing how "" the green mile "" developed in its three hour running time .  based on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue .  however , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction .  frank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner's story in "" the shawshank redemption "" , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) .  through edgecomb's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law .  from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , "" the green mile "" is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners .  the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them .  the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb .  the ensemble acting in the film is perfect .  hanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles .  they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles .  they are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience .  the more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting .  some particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan .  hutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie .  every time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying .  it would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks .  rockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection .  as a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others .  this irritation he creates makes his performance so believable .  the last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill .  duncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men .  his desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause .  his pain creates pain for the viewer .  however , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film .  the film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at "" the jerry springer show . ""  the scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks .  not only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief .  as the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction .  his death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing .  greene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don't even see him walk the infamous green mile .  however , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting .  the speed in "" the green mile "" is perfect .  if time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others .  the three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character .   "" the green mile "" is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene .  fighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing .  if you survive the first third of "" the green mile "" sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment .

1|"the jekyll and hyde story told from his maid's point of view is , in a word , "" dark "" .  you wouldn't expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevenson's novel , but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal .  jekyll/hyde ( john malkovich ) is terminally depressed and desperate .  mary reilly ( julia roberts ) is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the anti-woman sentiment of the times .  director stephen fears' version of the london slums makes us marvel that anyone survived them .  the lighting level is exceedingly low throughout the movie : it almost appears to be filmed in black and white .  the direction and cinematography are brilliant and liquid .  scenes flow into the next scene like honey oozing off a strawberry .   ( except there's no red , of course . )  the look is so moody and melodramatic that you'll be shocked when you leave the theater .  i saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward .  often the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts .  here the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good , but certainly powerless .  his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience .  two parts that make up a whole .  neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated , disaster is inevitable .  the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude .  when we finally see the transformation , the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction , not the psychological horror that the tale demands .  roberts and malkovich are skillful in their roles .  both are suitably melancholy , fitting in with the rest of the film .  the only flash of life and color comes from glenn close ( and her lips ) as the madam of a whorehouse where hyde lives , and surprisingly , jekyll apparently frequents .  life and color maybe , but this is not close's best role .  she seems little more than a cardboard cutout character .  a beautiful film in its own dreary way .  you'll appreciate the filmmaking craft , but don't expect to leave in an upbeat mood .

1|"aggressive , bleak , and unrelenting film about an interracial couple , steve and sam ( damon jones and elexa williams respectively ) , who are viciously attacked in a parking garage one night by a gang of skinheads .  the skinheads beat steve , then force him to watch as they brutally rape his girlfriend over and over again .  when sam kills herself later that evening , steve decides that the skinheads must be taught a lesson .  waiting seven months for the thuggish skinheads to forget about the incident entirely , steve shaves his head , dresses in combat boots and suspenders , tattoos his flesh with nazi symbols , and tries to infiltrate the gang .  as he gets closer and closer to the people who committed the horrible crime against his girlfriend , he begins to learn just how vicious these people really are and starts to question his own motives for violence .  randolph kret's script , based on two real life incidents that affected not only his life but the life of the film's producer shaun hill , is an affront on violence and intolerance .  the film causes its audience to be subjected to such brutality and ignorance that one can't help but be disgusted by the events presented within .  i've seen it said that this is the film fight club should have been , but david fincher's film was trying to define a generation .  kret's film is a wake up call to a generation and his message is a powerful one .  if fincher is the kubrick of our generation , then kret is our d . w .  griffith ( thematically speaking ) .  there is not a single likable character in the film .  the skinheads are obviously the most repulsive characters in the film , not only because of their beliefs but because they are in a constant state of fury ( not just against other races but within their own circles ) .  the african-american characters in the film are constantly shown as sexually assaulting drug abusers who are always on a joyride looking for someone to accost .  even gay men get in on the act , locating the skinheads' lair and beating them severely with lead pipes and other blunt objects .  the main character steve is also unlikable because of the person he becomes just to seek out revenge .  what all of this comes down to is the simple message that violence begets violence , and the constant clashes between factions will do nothing but continue the endless cycle of violence inherent in our society .  the cast of this film is absolutely remarkable .  damon jones shows a raw energy that many actors can't seem to summon these days and his performance seems nothing less than powerful .  his initial reaction to hearing about his girlfriend's suicide is one of the most affecting scenes i have ever seen in a film .  david lee wilson , who plays ( appropriately enough ) david lee is accurately evil as the second in command skinhead who also makes extra money performing oral sex on other men ( an irony that seems lost on the other skinheads ) .  wilson's character is pure hatred and he brings out this hate perfectly .  sadly , actor dave ward , who portrays the character of crew , will not be able to follow up his excellent performance as he was the victim of a vicious act of violence himself at the hands of a fellow actor during an incident of road rage .  ward showed immense promise and he will be greatly missed .  note : it is a shame that the filmmakers had to add a disclaimer to the end of the film stating that neither they nor the musicians contributing music for the film condone racism .  the message about hatred couldn't be spelled out any more clearly than it is here , but there are those who would probably find this film much more akin to a training video than a condemnation .  there are no "" winners "" at the end of this film either .  no character gets his or her comeuppance and the ending leaves us almost right where we began .  where american history x had redemption for most of its characters , no such victories are in store for pariah's band of twisted souls .  it is this bleak ending that carries the film's most powerful message : the message that , despite what you may be able to momentarily do to put your own mind to rest , evil will still be with us ( and in many forms ) and there is very little than can be done to eradicate it entirely .

1|"gothic murder-mystery yarns are not a new conceit .  in fact , they've been around in books and on film for many , many years .  without the proper handling , they come off as old-fashioned , bland , and outdated .   "" the gift , "" directed by sam raimi , is a tried-and-true effort that surprises very little , and includes everything from a wide array of suspects and red herrings , to mansions in the deep south with moss trees out front , to the eventual discovery of a waterlogged corpse found in a nearby pond .  it's fairly obvious who the killer is ; in fact , i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions .  the film ultimately shouldn't work , but it does , thanks to a sparkling cast that fills each character with so many memorable nuances , the most fun to be had is in simply watching the people interact with each other .  annie wilson ( cate blanchett ) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown .  some of her mainstay clients include valerie barksdale ( hilary swank ) , who is severely abused by her husband donnie ( keanu reeves ) , and buddy cole ( giovanni ribisi ) , an unstable mechanic who is confused by the nightmares he's been having about a mysterious blue diamond that is somehow linked to his father .  for annie , she does not give the readings merely for money , but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone's future .  her late grandmother ( rosemary harris ) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given , and she should always remember that .  when annie's eldest son is involved in a fight at school , she meets the nice-guy school principal , wayne collins ( greg kinnear ) , whom she finds herself attracted to .  but wayne is engaged to the wealthy jessica king ( katie holmes ) , whom annie immediately gets a negative vibe about .  at a party with her best friend linda ( kim dickens ) , annie stumbles upon jessica in a compromising position with lawyer david duncan ( gary cole ) .  soon after , jessica has disappeared , leaving everyone in a frenzy over what could have possibly happened to her , and annie starts to have nightmares and apparitions linking jessica with the vicious redneck donnie barksdale , and the pond behind his home .   "" the gift "" may be cliched on a sheer storytelling level , but the performances and tight direction from raimi ( who has redeemed himself for his embarrassing last film , 1999's "" for love of the game "" ) lift the picture up several notches .  slowly enveloping the viewer into the many intriguing characters and their individual plights , the disappearance of jessica at the 30-minute mark divulges the movie's true intentions and transforms the proceedings into a taut , at times frightening , horror-mystery .  at the center of the film is the exceptional cate blanchett ( 1999's "" the talented mr . ripley "" ) , who turns annie wilson from what could have been little more than a run-of-the-mill protagonist into a very exact , down-to-earth , realistic person with valid troubles and a caring attitude towards those around her .  blanchett takes the unextraordinary material and runs with it , giving the entire film a truly classy aura that it otherwise might not have had .  we follow her at every turn because she is so mesmerizing , both as a character and an actress .  blanchett isn't the only bright performer , as she is ably supported by one of the best casts of the year .  in her first role following her oscar win for 1999's "" boys don't cry , "" hilary swank is excellent as the confused valerie , who seeks guidance from annie , but is too scared to take her biggest advice of all : to leave the grossly abusive donnie .  as donnie , keanu reeves ( 2000's "" the watcher "" ) makes an utterly convincing backwoods meanie , so much so that it is difficult to believe he is an actor at all .  for the often-criticized reeves , whose acting abilities have never been the best , this is the biggest compliment he could possibly get , and it is also one of the better performances he has given .  giovanni ribisi ( 2000's "" the boiler room "" ) is heartbreaking as a mentally slow young man who sees annie as his only friend , and wants her to do nothing but help him understand why he is being plagued by bad dreams about his dad .  in the small , but pivotal role of the sleazy jessica king , katie holmes ( 2000's "" wonder boys "" ) has turned in yet another stunning supporting turn .  her promiscuous role of jessica is one she has never played before , and she is radiant in her few scenes .  finally , kim dickens ( 2000's "" hollow man "" ) makes her usual strong impression as annie's spicy best friend , linda .  the other notable aspect of "" the gift "" is its moody atmosphere that lays such a thickly foreboding air over every scene it's almost suffocating .  thanks to cleverly construed editing by arthur coburn and bob murawski , and the successful use of different eerie sounds effects and a very good music score by christopher young , the movie not only achieves a scary undercurrent , but one that is filled with dread .  helped along by a strong screenplay by billy bob thornton and tom epperson , which makes the most of its setting and delightful cast , "" the gift "" is that rarest of thrillers that actually thrills , and offers up a fair share of chills , too .  it may not be groundbreakingly original , but it sure is an entertaining ride for the duration of its running time .

1|"one of the best things about my job is that , every so often , a film still catches me by surprise .

1|"of all the films i've come to see this year ( 1997 ) , i think only chasing amy had as many "" laugh-out-loud "" moments .  i'm not saying that i was hysterically rolling on the floor while watching waiting for guffman , but my mouth burst open with at least a delighted guffaw at least every couple of minutes .  and i think i'm the kind of person that laughs least at movies , even when i find them funny .  usually all you can get out of me is a warm smile , so to get me laughing out loud , and so frequently , is a really good sign .  waiting for guffman is the story of blaine , missouri , a town celebrating it's 150th anniversary , and the musical that is being put on for the big event .  the play is being directed by corky st . clair ( christopher guest , who also wrote and directed this "" mockumentary "" as well as co-writing several original musical numbers ) , the effeminate broadway hopeful determined to make this production a smashing success .  teaming up with st . clair are a handful of blaine residents : allan pearl ( eugene levy ) , a jewish dentist who spent his youth not as the class clown , but sitting right next to him and studying him , ron and sheila albertson ( fred willard and catherine o'hara respectively ) , a married couple setting their sights on hollywood , libby mae brown ( parker posey ) , the dense but fun queen of the dairy queen , and a few others .  everybody in this movie is brilliant , absolutely so , but levy particularly stands out .  these characters are portrayed with such saddening realism that you can't help but love them , as pathetic as they really are .  although levy stands out , guest , willard , o'hara , and posey are all wonderful and definitely should be commended for their performances !  if there was an oscar for an ensemble performance , this is the group that should sweep it .  some humor was a tad uneven from the rest of the film and , even after starting very humorously , they nearly lost me with the tad-too-long intros .  as delightful as it was , it began to get monotonous .  thankfully , just as your about to say "" ok , maybe i should run to the bathroom "" , they finally get past the intros and onto the rehearsal scenes .  like a play , this film gives a very three-act feel , the intros ( funny , but almost too long ) , the rehearsals ( even funnier ) , and finally , the actual performance of the play ( excellent ! ) .  like i said , each character really shines , even when done with a subtle approach .  you can't really watch these people and not think they're real people !  even they way they talk , with awkward pauses and stumbles that don't feel staged at all , you feel like you're watching a real , albeit funny , documentary .  and even with silly lyrics , the original songs when the play is finally put on , are absolutely wonderful !  as a word of note , despite it's "" r "" rating , waiting for guffman is really quite clean .  this rating came from a brief , very brief use of the grand-daddy of all swear words .  even if that really bothers you , let me say that it's not presented in a vulgar , cheap-laugh way .  it's actually quite humorous and tastefully done !  it might be hard knowing what to expect with waiting for guffman .  it's silly humor , but it's also so dry , subtle , and intelligently done that you're not insulted by it .  it's always really nice to see a comedy that isn't all slapstick and vulgarity , and this film is one of the better ones of the better ones !  i'd recommend seeing it !

1|"in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well .  taken as a whole , there's little that's special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us .  but it's intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted .  so , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it's a worthwhile sample of entertainment .  like scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man .  the formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different .  al pacino's slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams' sean mcguire is much more subtle .  and matt damon's will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o'donnell's charlie .  will is a troubled individual .  as a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse .  an orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis .  now , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet .  he has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box .  but he's a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems .  while working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building's hall blackboards .  then , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work .  will flees , but lambeau tracks him down .  unfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer .  the judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist .  eventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case .  after a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor .  and , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver ) .  the script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation .  the characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles .  at one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a "" taster's choice moment . ""  later , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith .   ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it's not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . )  director gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes .  there's an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric .  likewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie's friendship .  many of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic .  matt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will .  minnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it's refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) .  the outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber .  arguably the best dramatic work in the actor's career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination .  adequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) .  like most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable .  but meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren't always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail .  good will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the "" good "" in the title .

1|"clue is an unfairly ignored comedy , very similar to 1976's murder by death .  this big screen version of the classic board game ( what's next . . .  chutes and ladders : the motion picture ? ) is filled with slapstick antics and silly dialogue .  the plot , for what it's worth , has all the characters from the game ( in this case , the names from the game are used as aliases ) meeting in an isolated mansion to confront mr . boddy ( lee ving ) , the man who's been blackmailing them all .  when he turns up dead , everyone ( including the audience ) must figure out whodunnit . . .  and in what room , and with what object .  while not as witty as neil simon's murder by death , clue definitely has it moments .  it has so many moments in fact that i use a lot of the lines from the film when i'm joking around with my friends .  to this day , whenever someone says the phrase "" well , to make a long story short "" i have the follow up phrase "" too late "" ready to go .  the cast ( all very good comedic talents ) play well off one another , while the late madeline kahn ( as the dark and sultry mrs . white ) sometimes steals the film away from the rest .  and colleen camp , as the french maid yvette , displays some of her natural talents as well .  clue is available on dvd from paramount home video .  it includes the film in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and is enhanced for 16x9 televisions ) and features the original theatrical trailer .  a french language audio track is also available .  the trailer holds up well considering most previews from that time do not , and it even includes a scene not in the film itself ( a scene that should have been in the film , as it's a good joke ) .  also , the trailer is scored to the music from airplane ! , which was an interesting choice .  when clue played in theaters , it ran with the gimmick of three different endings .  if you wanted to see all three , you had to go to the movies three separate times .  so when the film was released on home video , rather than releasing three separate videos , all three endings were included on one tape . . .  the first two endings being "" what if ?

( note : there's an easter egg hidden in the disc pertaining to this .  after watching the film with a randomly selected ending , when you return to the menu screen you will be able to highlight the large magnifying glass and select it .  when you do , a secret menu opens , allowing you to watch any of the three endings by themselves . )  now while i applaud the effort of paramount here , as they clearly tried to do something special with the disc , it just doesn't work well .  first , why not give the viewer the choice of what ending we want to watch ?  maybe someone like myself who's seen the movie hundreds of times would like to sit down and show it to someone with the second ending only .  i'm no technical dvd expert , but i can't imagine that being too hard to accomplish .  secondly , the delay between when the film itself ends and one of the endings begins is too long and too obvious , thereby becoming a distraction right when you definitely don't need a distraction .  finally , the back of the dvd case states "" and now , with this special dvd version , you can see all 3 surprise endings "" .  i have no idea why they would word it that way , since that's not a special feature in the slightest .  the video has been out for fifteen years now ( good lord , has it been that long ? ) and it's played on television with all three endings all the time .  these are merely minor complaints however , seeing that i've watched the home video version hundreds of times and have no problem watching the film as such on the dvd .  the picture and sound are wonderfully improved over my worn out vhs copy , and i'm thrilled that paramount agrees with me that clue is a film worthy of being preserved on this great digital format .

1|the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane .  billy , played by michael keaton , is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble .  christopher lloyd portrays henry , an obsessive-compulsive who requires that everything be neat , orderly , on schedule , and by the books .  he thinks he's a doctor so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports .  jack , played by peter boyle , thinks he's jesus .  and finally , there's stephen furst as albert , a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases .  the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four-some when their psychiatrist , dr . weitzman , takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium .  during a pit stop , they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan .  the movie's charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast .  the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively ; they never miss an opportunity to argue , bicker , or insult one another .  henry and jack , for example , fight over who's going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game .  the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other .  michael keaton is well cast as billy ; he gives his cynical character considerable complexity .  as the divinely jack , peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one-dimensional character funny and fresh .  although stephen furst's catatonic character is cliched , the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing .  while keaton , boyle , and furst are good , it's christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special .  lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance .  his body language ( for example , the way he walks ) and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character .  lloyd's brilliant performance yields a pathetic , moving , and memorable character .  the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise .  the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot .  |0.6833333333333332|0.8666666666666667|0.8833333333333333|The movie is a delightful comedy with a standout cast and excellent chemistry between the actors.

1|"people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies .  often science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller .  in such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked .  but , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic .  such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman .  the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits .  but the right stuff film isn't even fiction .  it was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program .  the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes .  the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier .  many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado .  but one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records .  ten years later , soviets have launched "" sputnik "" marking the beginning of the space age .  in order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space .  best air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image .  in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s .  such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman's film looks quite atypical for its time .  with more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life .  but the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker .  philip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies .  the right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking "" artsy "" projects .  the right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film .  the plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts .  the film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece .  that gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles .  sam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty .  on the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases .  shepard's performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn .  young dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward .  always reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard .  kaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots' wives .  royal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch .  great acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman's superb direction .  most notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time .  the beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline .  everything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world .  in that setting , it's quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights .  but the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and "" natural "" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots .  their entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity .  this contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , "" mercury "" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space .  those contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman's superb use of poetic movie language .  editing is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) .  although kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights .  those effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space .  another fine contribution of this film is "" oscar "" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it .  it is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy .  some of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period .  this film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws .  some of the "" mercury "" astronauts aren't fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) .  film also lacks proper closure .  on the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long .  also , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan's america .  in some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s .  time has passed ; now we don't see astronauts as heroes .  in this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers .  few young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up .  but this film , sentimental reminder of the times "" when future began "" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow "" mercury "" astronauts' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky .  and even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema .

1|"i find most of television so intensely boring that i simply never turn on my set , unless i'm watching a movie .  i don't even have cable , so i went to radio shack to buy an antenna specifically for the purpose of watching "" the x-files "" every sunday night .  it's the only show that's worth an hour of my time each week ( though , since i don't watch reruns , i'm glad that i have six months of the year to avoid television altogether ) .  i am an avid fan of the show , and have been for about three years now .  and i love gillian anderson .  the x-files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off .  the film is like a two-hour episode , except that there are a lot more special effects , the plot is thicker , and the resolution is more satisfying .  this is a terrific film , both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it ( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment ) .  i expected to like it more than any episode i've seen , and my expectations were met .  actually , the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices , but , thankfully , the makers managed to do it right .  when the finale ended , the fbi branch known as the x-files had been destroyed , and our heroes , mulder ( david duchovny ) and scully ( gillian anderson ) were left stripped of five years of hard work .  the film picks up soon after ; and mulder and scully have been reduced to field agents investigating a bomb threat in a federal building .  but wait , i'm getting ahead of myself .  the film actually opens in the ice age , about 32 , 000 years prior , during which a couple of prehistoric guys get attacked by a vicious alien .  the alien's blood infects them ( fans of the show will certainly remember the black cancer ) , and the story jumps into modern times , during which a young boy is also infected with the cancer .  it turns out that the bomb was planted to kill the boy , and mulder and scully uncover the cover-up despite the fact that scully has resigned from her position in the fbi .  soon , they find out that the whole thing has to do with aliens .  as i've written before , it's not easy to write plot summaries for films like this , because everything needs to be a surprise .  fans of the show will know what to expect , and i seriously doubt any of them being disappointed with the film .  director rob bowman has done a great job expanding the eerie feeling of the show to the big screen , making small adjustments and minor changes to utilize the possibilities that film allows over television .  there are some truly suspenseful and well-created scenes here ( late in the film , when they're in the alien spacecraft , you'll see one of the better action sequences in recent cinema ) .  the special effects are very good , and the production design by christopher nowak is fantastic .  what i find interesting is that the x-files is actually a great way for series neophytes to get into the story .  our heroes are given subtle introductions ( we're not expected to know them on the outset ) , and the film explains enough of the story that prior knowledge of the series isn't required to understand the film .  there are , of course , little elements that the makers have included as payoff to the fans , but i'll keep those as surprises .  it takes a lot of thought and understanding of the series to create a film using roots as complicated as the ones that the series provides , and then create a coherent film that anyone can understand clearly .  the series is strong for a lot of reasons .  it's original ( though it has many ties to "" the twilight zone "" and owes some homage to hitchcock ) , and impressively eerie for a television show .  what really makes the series shine , however , are the actors .  duchovny has so much presence , and is just a fun guy to watch .  he has that confidence that will someday make him into a bankable leading man .  anderson is equally good , and paralyzingly beautiful ; she's also a strong actress .  both performers have acted in little more than their series , however , though i think they'll both get their chances to prove themselves very soon .  i enthusiastically recommend the x-files , both for fans and non-fans .  1998 is a summer filled with disappointing blockbusters , and this film should satisfy where most of the others leave you completely dry .  it's an intelligent film , and takes you places that you might not have been ( or , at least , might not have seen so many times that they feel familiar ) .  the x-files is impressive in concept , as well : fans of the series are likely to be highly critical , and to take the premise beyond the series is a risky move .  it's nice to see a risk pay off for a change .  actually , it's nice to see a risk at all .

1|" "" the celebration "" is one of an elite kind of films that is completely absorbant .  you know , where you sit down to watch it , and no matter what you've heard about it before , you just can't help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs .  i prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like .  i don't really feel there are to be any real "" rules "" for cinema ; a film can do anything , as long as it makes it work .  but i do ask that all films have one thing in common : they create experiences .  when i watch a film , no matter what kind of film it is , i want to be able to take certain memories along with me .   "" the celebration "" is great because it's chock full of those .  it creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life .  and then it makes things just a tad bit farscial , just to make sure you're paying attention , which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you're of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up .  the story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him .  all his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) .  the eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father's home .  his brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable .  we then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she's going to .  once they're all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film's punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age .  but since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it's all terribly interesting to watch .  twists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends .  the most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion .  as a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose "" the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability "" so that they may "" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . ""  i have not seen "" breaking the waves , "" the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but "" the celebration "" works exquisitely in this department .  it feels like reality , like you're actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video .  as a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to .  we see key moments in people's lives that they wouldn't dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film .  the key , though , to this film , and the reason it's not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth .  throughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water .  of course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn't have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them .  and yes , it's thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier .  but then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he's done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface .  the final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex .  everyone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them .  the actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life .  as such , "" the celebration "" may be the one truly bizarro film of the year : a work of art so eerily close to reality that it's utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating .

1|"matthew broderick and high school comedy .  the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986 .  now it is 13 years later , and broderick has another high school comedy , election , to show the world .  ferris buehler's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows .  it was light , fluffy , tasty , and sparkling clean .  but election is far different .  this production is a dark , and frighteningly realistic one that does so much more than entertain for the 103 minutes it occupies ; it shocks as well .  jim mcallister ( matthew broderick ) is the type of teacher that makes american high schools proud .  he is a kind , caring , younger man who has built his life around carver high school .  in turn , carver high school has provided a home for him .  jim has won teacher of the year no less than three times in his 12 year span , and is a well respected social studies teacher among the student body .  tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an intelligent , outgoing , and , to quote the film , "" super nice "" young girl .  she is involved in numerous extracurricular activities , always has her hand up first in class , and is extremely popular among most of the student body .  so , it is a natural progression when she decides to run for school president .  the metzler family is an extremely wealthy one .  the father , dick ( holmes osborne ) , owns a cement company .  the mother , jo ( jeanine jackson ) , is an ideal housewife .  and the two children , paul ( chris klein ) and tammy ( jessica campbell ) , are both students at carver high school .  paul was the quarterback of the football team before he injured himself , and is definitely a candidate for most popular person in school .  tammy is a lesbian who , to say the least , is going through a period of self discovery .  for reasons of revenge , hatred , and sexual envy , jim convinces paul to run against tracy for school president .  he claims that in a democracy you need choices , and having tracy run unopposed creates a dictatorship of sorts .  so paul agrees and the race is on .  but then , in an effort to spite the two candidates , tammy announces that she is running as well .  her campaign is straightforward : people only run to put it on their college applications , then they do nothing .  well , "" i don't even want to go to college , "" she says .  in election , there are no "" good guys "" .  almost everyone has their own agenda .  no matter how deeply hidden , the production digs it up and exploits it for the audience .  tracy is the type of person that you remember from high school .  she is the girl that would be labeled "" most likely to achieve anything she wants "" in the yearbook , and everyone secretly envied her because of that .  jim is a teacher that takes the trust that students give him as a privilege , and uses it to his own amoral advantage .  everyone , including the principal , a former teacher , all the candidates , and even paul's girlfriend are two sided characters .  that is much of this film's beauty , it doesn't have the typical good guys that hollywood likes , instead it is a realistic portrayal of the real world , specializing in revealing the type of sexual perversions that people usually keep to themselves .  matthew broderick couldn't have been any more perfect for this role .  his character is often similar bill murray's award winning role in the 1998 film , rushmore .  of the two acting jobs , broderick's is far superior .  but even he is overshadowed by the young reese witherspoon .  the hatred that she causes the audience to develop towards her , is simply indescribable .  broderick and witherspoon are simply at their best when they are playing off each other in various scenes .  one such moment occurs when she approaches him in his car as he is leaving school one day .  you can see her self pride in her eyes as she presents him a list of signatures , making her an eligible candidate .  and his subtle disgust with her is apparent , although he tries to mask it between the lines and attempts to put on a happy face .  the supporting cast is one with little hollywood experience .  but that is far from apparent as everyone takes control of their part .  however , the real treat is jessica campbell in her confused role as a young homosexual girl .  this is never more apparent than the scene where she delivers her speech announcing her so-called platform for presidency .  she is just marvelous as her hatred towards what she thinks to be an unjust system is expressed .  if ferris buehler made you feel good about american high schools , and gave you an innocent laugh or two , then the movie achieved its goal .  but don't you dare think that election's goals are similar .  it is just as real in its portrayal of high school , as its characters are in the real world .  there certainly is no pile of marshmallows here .

' .  fans of these sorts of movies will be laughing at every other second at all the 'hidden jokes' they missed the first time around while normal movie watchers will look at them like they're insane .  the rocky horror picture show , recently re-released in a 'special edition' to video , is the mother of all cult films .  period .  like some other cult films , most notably little shop of horrors , the rocky horror picture show is a musical with a twisted edge to it .  this movie begins out innocently enough- a couple get engaged at a friend's wedding and get a flat tire in the middle of the night while it's raining .  they go to a castle to try to use the phone .  little do they know that the castle is owned by dr . frank n . furter , a mad transexual transvestite scientist who has recently created a creature he will use for personal reasons .  the acting is pretty good overall .  tim curry ( home alone 2 , legend ) is over-the-top as frank n . furter .  it's interesting to see that this movie was one of future oscar winner susan sarandon's ( dead man walking ) first film- she plays janet , the girlfriend of brad majors .  even the singer meatloaf is in it ! !  the songs are all very good yet twisted in their own way .  a sampling of titles range from damn it , janet to touch-a touch-a touch-a touch me .  all the actors sing their songs with no dubbing from other actors- kind of a bad thing .  barry bostwick ( brad majors ) tries to sing as does susan sarandon , but tim curry is clearly the most professional having extensive stage experience .  meatloaf sings like meatloaf .  the new special edition contains two original movie trailers of the film as well as two songs deleted from the original version .  sadly , the songs are tacked after the credits- kind of defeats the purpose .  if you want to see a different film , watch this one ! !  |-0.009999999999999981|0.8333333333333334|0.8000000000000002|"The overall sentiment of the explanation is mixed, leaning slightly towards positive.

1|"confession time : i have never , ever seen gone with the wind .  i don't know why , really .  haven't wanted to check it out on video , haven't been at home the nights it was on network tv , and it was too far to drive the last time it was on the big-screen .  so right up front , i'll admit that i don't know what the heck i'm talking about , but here goes . . .  is titanic the gone with the wind of the 1990's ?  maybe that's going a little bit too far .  as good a job as leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet do in this movie , they're no clark gable and vivien leigh .  but . . .  the parallels are there .  gwtw was the first movie to take real advantage of the most revolutionary technology available -- technicolor .  titanic takes revolutionary steps forward in seamlessly integrating computer graphic design with actors .  gwtw places america's greatest tragedy in the background of a classic love story , titanic does the same with the atlantic's most legendary tragedy .  they both have strong-willed redheaded heroines , they both exploit the class differences between the aristocracy and the slaves/steerage bums , they were both incredibly expensive and popular . . .  ok , maybe that's not enough parallels .  so titanic's not in gwtw's league .  no matter .  titanic is a great movie in its own right , complete with spills , thrills and ( especially ) chills .  much has been made of the humongous cost of the production , and all of the care than went into making the huge luxury liner come alive again .  the money was obviously well-spent .  the costumes look great , the sets look great , the cgi graphics look great .  i especially liked the expensive little touches , like spending tons of money on authentic titanic china only to break it all on the floor as the ship sinks .  but writer/director/producer james cameron's real challenge in writing/directing/ producing titanic wasn't just costuming and set design and special effects .  cameron's major headache was keeping the audience interested in a tale where everybody knows the ending going in .  he succeeds masterfully .  cameron does two things that work incredibly well .  first , he shows us modern-day salvage operations on titanic ( that's just "" titanic "" , not "" the titanic "" , mind you ) .  the first glimpse we get of titanic is the ship in its present state , corroding slowly away under the hammering pressure of the north atlantic , from the window of a minisub piloted by treasure hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) .  television coverage of the exploration of titanic intrigues 101-year-old rose calvert ( gloria stuart ) , who survived the wreck in 1912 .  stuart does a phenomenal job in a brief role , narrating the story of her experience to a stunned paxton and his roughneck crew .  secondly , cameron keeps the storyline focused almost exclusively on the rose character , and the romantic triangle between rose ( winslet ) , her bastard millionaire fiancee cal hockley ( billy zane ) and the irrepressible young artist jack daswon ( dicaprio ) .  the way that big-budget disaster movies usually go wrong is to have an all-star cast , so we see the impact of the disaster on a wide group of people .  cameron wisely chooses to stick with rose and jack , while paying scant heed to the celebrities on board .  the supporting cast is professional , but mostly anonymous -- other than kathy bates as the unsinkable molly brown , there's no moment when you stop and say , oh , yeah , i know him , what's he been in .   ( although i would like to have seen colm meaney in a white star uniform , or even as the ill-fated engineer . )  the love story itself is rather conventional .  i think some reviewers found it weak , and that may be a fair criticism .  the performances are the key here .  zane has the meatiest part in the movie , and he plays the arrogant , condescending steel millionaire to the hilt .  he's smooth , he looks great in a tuxedo , and he's a convincing enough jerk that the winslet-dicaprio relationship looks plausible .  at the moment when he sees a little girl too frightened to get aboard a lifeboat , you can hear the wheels in his mind turning , saying not "" can i save this little girl ? "" ,  but "" can she help me get on a lifeboat ? ""  dicaprio is a revelation .  i hadn't seen him before in anything , and didn't know what the heck to expect , really .   ( honestly , i expected a bad irish accent , but cameron evidently decided that was a bad idea , so dicaprio plays a poor american artist who wins a ticket in a poker game . )  dicaprio exhibits an infectious joy at being alive , and being on the titanic , that it's hard not to like him .  from the moment that the ship leaves port until it hits the iceberg , dicaprio has to carry the movie and keep our interest , and he never falters .  winslet's character grows up a lot during the movie , and so does her performance .  at first , she's not required to do anything but wear period clothing and look drop-dead gorgeous .  we know from the narration that she's monstrously unhappy with her arranged marriage to zane , but there isn't any expression of these feelings until she encounters dicaprio .  winslet and dicaprio develop a chemistry that manages to propel the movie along until the ship hits the iceberg .  it's at that moment where winslet's character really comes alive .  faced with real danger , she drops her spoiled-rich-girl mannerisms and does a splendid job .  as rose and jack race around the doomed ship , looking for shelter from the freezing water and cal's fiery temper , winslet turns in a superb acting performance , mixing courage and compassion and anger with sheer shrieking terror .  of course , the most interesting character is the ship itself .  cameron has clearly fallen in love with titanic , and shows her in every mood -- as a deserted wreck , down in the boiler room , up on the bridge , down in the hold , at the captain's table , down in steerage -- and manages to bring the great ship back from the dead .  cameron's greatest gift is that he allows us to fall in love with titanic as well .

1|"john cusack is the kind of actor who seems to effortlessly slide into his respective film roles .  so effortlessly that people tend to forget he's there , much in the way people rarely recall many of the great character actors ( anyone who can put the name james rebhorn with that actor's face is invited to treat themselves to a product from one of my sponsors ) .  example : the other day my mother asked me ( the expert , of course ) if there were any movies out worth seeing , never mind that our tastes couldn't be more divergent--- i'll never forget the day she recommended that i go see a night at the roxbury for god sakes , and to be fair she was mightily pissed at me for telling her that go !  was a lot of fun ( which it is ) , so i didn't see this as anything more than a futile attempt at conversation .  i muttered , with a little trepidation , that she might enjoy high fidelity .  she responded with her usual query , "" whose in that one ? ""  this is a question whose answer that seems to immediately conjure up the kind of movie you went to see .  if the reply is julia roberts you probably assume it was something wispy and light , a sylvester stallone movie and you picture a bloodbath with few words and much involuntary bicep flexing , and a woody allen movie means hyper articulate white people ( usually of the jewish faith ) fretting about in some upper east side palace .  anyway , when i answered "" john cusack "" , she replied with a rather stunned "" who ? "" , as if it was unreasonable for her to know whom i was referring to .  now i know for a fact that my mother has seen several cusack movies , most recently being john malkovich and pushing tin , but i suppose it's understandable that she would not recognize the name , after all , for most , names are tougher than faces .  i showed her a picture of cusack's mug in the paper hoping for an "" oh - him , yes he's quite good "" instead i got a "" no - i don't know him "" .  at this point i was way beyond frustration into a realm of nose hair yanking anger ( yes , filmic ignorance is all it takes to get me into the nose hair pulling zone ) , till i realized something : i doubt that much of america would recognize cusack's relatively bland visage , or even the name which is rather bland compared to the coolness of a brad pitt or tom cruise , one-syllable names that glide off the tongue with the velocity of a speeding car .  cu-sack . cu-sack - no , not quite as cool .  i'm sure that twenty years from now cusack will forever be referred to as "" the guy from ( add in the cusack film of your choice ) "" .  he's not a brand name , and his movies usually aren't big moneymakers , but in his own unassuming way he's kind of a genius .  with his pleasant , common man looks , and charming semi-articulate blatherings he has become one of the most likeable romantic leading men of the 90's .  from the sure thing to say anything cusack has merged the talents of early tom hanks and early jack lemmon .  despite the fact that nearly every character he plays is a variation of the character before it ( the schlumpy every man ) , he's a constantly enjoyable screen persona , like albert brooks or woody allen .  and he knows how to chose scripts , while the stephan baldwin's and val kilmer's seem to put them selves in everything ( the former actually had the insight to follow up oscar winner usual suspects with a pauly shore vehicle , and judging from his latest projects it looks like he still has yet to fire his agent ) , cusack generally picks rewarding projects ( save for the unwatchable hot pursuit , a 1988 film also featuring a young ben stiller ) .  high fidelity is his second collaboration with hit or miss english director stephan fears ( the grifters , the hi-lo country ) , and it's a hit .  it was also co-written by cusack , and some of his collaborators on the terrific comedy , grosse point blank .  it's not quite as entertaining or as funny as that film , but as it progresses in its meandering fashion , the movie cast something of a spell over me .  high fidelity begins as a hipster ode to the non-committal rob , a vinyl record store owner , who opens the film by breaking down the fourth wall with much abandon and educating us in his "" top 5 break ups list "" .  this is something cusack does the entire film a la ferris bueller's day off .  at first the talking-directly-into-the-camera-schtick had me vaguely annoyed , mostly because it reminded me so much of the film body shots which used a similar conceit , but it began to grow on me due almost entirely to cusack's witty delivery .  he's the kind of guy we don't mind talking directly to us .  gradually the film settles into a shampoo-like tragi-comic character study , of a guy who must confront himself and his personal failures in order to figure out the true person he is ( yes it's all very existential ) .  though that plot-line is mostly enjoyable , the thing i liked the most about the film is how much pleasure it offers in introducing us to minor characters , all of whom ( now this is really something ) are terrific enough to warrant their own films .  the best of which is jack black ( of the very funny show tenacious d , a program that sadly went the way of bruce willis' hair ? ? ? unfortunately that annoying smirk remains ) , an ardent record store employee who bullies customers into buying exactly what he wants them to buy .  he's the kind of guy i'm sure we've all met before , a blowhard who thinks he's always right and will do anything in his power ( be it yell , argue , insult ) to hoist his opinion onto others .  but i like this guy , because of how black plays him .  the actor is portly with a round baby face and crazy eyes , but despite his size he leaps to and fro like a manic speed freak ( which might be a bit of a redundant description , seeing as how all the speed freaks i know are manic ) .  he's the kind of supporting character who would be impossibly annoying comic relief in most other films .   ( look at what that hack jan de bont did to poor phillip seymour hoffman in twister ) .  but fears and black never let that happen .  the character , for all his shucking and jiving is steeped in reality .  he's over the top , but in a way we can all probably relate to .  catherine zeta-jones , in her brief role , gives a vivid portrayal of a women completely enamored with her own "" charm "" .  tim robbins registers in an even tinier part as a new age-type , a character played entirely for cartoon yuks , but still manages to work its desired comic effect .  the one exception in the acting department is a bit of a doozy , the main love interest played by danish actress iben hjejle ( mifune ) , who completely obliterates any trace of a danish accent , replacing it with a stilted american phonation .  i give her kudos for attempting such a contradictory role , but instead of being likeable , she comes across as rather robotic , and as such it's hard to see why cusack's character would be so obsessed with her especially when he has a beautiful , intelligent writer ( natasha gregson wagner ) potentially waiting in the wings .  this reminded me of say anything , where the charming cusack was paired with the charmless ione skye , and in midnight in the garden of good and evil where the poor bastard had to put up with alison eastwood ( whose unbelievably more wooden then father , clint for those "" special people "" whose wheels turn a little slower ) .  in fact cusack is rarely paired up with a personality that matches his , though i'd bet that if laura and natasha switched roles , the result would be more effective .  high fidelity works almost entirely on the strength of its characters and performances .  fears' direction is somewhat stilted , and the script is sometimes a little too ( and this is a word i'm beginning to hate to use but alas i must ) quirky for its own good ( i think i'll blame that on scott rosenberg , who judging from what he did with beautiful girls , con air , and things to do in denver while your dead , has his fingerprints all over the most irritating bits of this movie ) .  but cusack really does deserve an award , for being so damn ? ? ? cusackian .  i'm afraid that his talents are so understated that he may have to wait till his hip needs replacing to be offered such an award worthy of his considerable talent .  his character , rob ( whose sort of like an older , more bitter lloyd from say anything ) is funny and tragic without being pathetic , and that cusack can do all this , and still not imprint himself onto the minds of most audiences , is something of an achievement .

1|"only a year after the initial release of "" scream , "" the horror send-up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre , the inevitable sequel "" scream 2 "" has arrived in our theaters .  while the tongue-in-cheek , parodic element is still noticeable in this film , it's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story .  the first film , while often violent and gruesome , was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant .  the premise of "" scream 2 "" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called "" stab , "" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers ( courtney cox ) about the events in "" scream , "" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening .  i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy .  its conclusion , in which a bleeding , wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it's a publicity stunt , is more surreal and disturbing than anything else .  the satire in "" scream 2 "" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general .  although resident horror film geek randy ( jamie kennedy ) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels ( and , interestingly enough , how they are usually inferior to their predecessors ) , the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well .  everything from "" friends "" and "" saved by the bell "" to "" showgirls "" and "" terminator 2 "" is referenced here ; horror is only one of many genres available for lampooning , and there aren't any "" wes carpenter "" jokes this time .  more importantly , this film portrays characters willing to go to disturbing lengths for media attention as well as characters whose perceptions have clearly been warped by what they have seen on tv and film .  the killings are clearly an imitation of the previous murders from "" scream "" ( in fact , the culprit even plans to use the influence of horror movies as a courtroom defense ) , weathers exploits the situation for her own notoriety , and one man seems willing to save the heroine's life only if it will earn him an interview on the today show .  understandably , "" scream 2 "" does not go so far as to actually blame the movies , but rather shows that those who do imitate horror movies are already sick and twisted .  couple that with the fact that several of the characters , most notably the lead character sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , are fairly well-developed and that there are some genuine moments of spine-chilling suspense , and what we have is a pretty darned good horror movie in its own right .  we don't just get the horror of scary masks and graphic gore - we also get the horror of sympathetic characters who seem helpless as their friends are slaughtered ( and , in one case , a significant character who was an audience favorite even bites the dust ) and whose lives have been reduced to constant fear of a crazed murderer lurking around the corner .  while i have not seen any of his other work , it's easy to see why craven is generally touted as the most sophisticated "" slasher film "" director , as he clearly cares about something more than just the actual acts of slashing .  unfortunately , "" scream 2 "" occasionally reverts to the time-honored horror tradition of throwing logic out the window .  for example , several characters seem quite clearly dead and inexplicably turn up alive later - there has been a running gag in both movies about the villain being able to pull off this particular trick , but it also happens with other characters and in an even less believable fashion .  there are also a few scenes in which the killer suddenly appears behind the next victim in a situation such that ( s ) he clearly would have been seen moving in that direction .  as for the question of whether or not "" scream 2 "" is yet another sequel not as good as its predecessor .   .   .  well , it's hard to say .  i gave the first "" scream "" 3 1/2 stars as well because it worked pretty consistently as a light-hearted send-up .   "" scream 2 "" bounces all over the place stylistically , but it does a better job delivering the genuine scares and asking the questions about media violence that were only hinted at in the first installment .  i'm not sure which is the better movie , but i did leave the theater convinced of one thing : sequels , however much randy might argue , do not necessarily suck .

1|"with the release of gattaca , i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens , or aliens in general .  hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films , but what was usually lacking was a good story . . .  and good characters . . .  and good acting , etc ( contact being the exception ) .  and for some reason , hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth .  the closest , that i have seen anyway , was 2001 : a space odyssey , which made mankind an alien race themselves , being dwarfed by the technology which they created .  now comes gattaca , another film about technology reigning supreme , except here on our planet .  the difference between 2001 and this one is simple : gattaca is more frightening .  most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering .  using this premise , writer/director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills .  unfortunately , due to a lack of advertising , i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office .  since seeing the film , i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca .  lately , however , i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca .  most people don't even realize that it is a film .  despite this fact , i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it .  niccol's film deserves more than what independence day made because it is smarter , better produced , and more realistic .  gattaca begins in the 21st century .  procreating is now done in a petri dish , and genetic engineering is the normal way of doing it .  natural child birth is considered old-fashioned .  we are introduced to jerome morrow ( ethan hawke ) , an employee of the gattaca space program .  one of the directors of the program has been murdered , and the main suspect is one vincent freeman .  the only problem is that jerome morrow is vincent freeman .  vincent was born the natural way when his parents decided on bringing their first child into the world through love .  however , after his birth , and through several genetic tests , doctors tell his parents that he will have a 99% chance of a weak heart , as well as poor eye sight and a short life span .  as a result , both parents decide to bring their next baby into the world via genetics .  anton ( loren dean ) is produced without flaws , and the competition between brothers spawns .  vincent has a dream to fly a solo-flight around the titan , the 14th moon of saturn , but because of his condition , gattaca , and society in general , forces him to do menial labor around the company .  labeled an "" in-valid , "" vincent's dream seems impossible , until he meets a black-market dna specialist , german ( tony shalhoub ) .  german introduces him to a "" valid "" who has been paralized from the waste down due to an automobile accident .  jerome morrow ( jude law ) agrees to give vincent all the proper identification tools ( urine , blood , skin and hair samples , etc . ) that he will need to get past gattaca's tight security .  in exchange , vincent will provide jerome with the rent money and friendship .  after the murder , however , his dreams are put at risk due to one of vincent's eyelashes left at the scene of the crime .  irene cassini ( uma thurman ) is a genetically flawed "" valid "" working for gattaca , and she begins to fall in love with vincent/jerome .  gattaca is one of the best science fiction films i have seen in a long time .  only two other intelligent science fiction films have come out in the past two years ( contact and the arrival ) and gattaca will rank among them .  unfortunately , whenever one intelligent film comes out against special effects-laden films , it normally gets buried .  the second best thing about gattaca is the production design by jan roelfs .  the orange glow of gattaca's scenes are impressive , but the sets deserve most of the credit .  the sets are very well done , creating a futuristic sense , but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers .  as we look at the designs , we realize that these buildings aren't too far into the future .  this brings the plot even more credibility as genetic engineering becomes more possible by every passing day .  the best thing , however , is the plot .  the story is more than your average sci-fi/thriller .  at its heart , it develops a theme which is never overpowering but is always present .  perhaps niccol is warning our race about the changes genetic tampering could bring .  would our society become a bunch of soulless zombies ?  maybe human nature is a result of mankind's flaws .  if we get rid of flaws , do we get rid of dreams as well ?  niccol's intelligent script handles all these questions extremely well , and the result is an incredibly smart thriller set against a dramatic story , or vice versa .  the power of the actors brings a lot of credibility to flat characters .  while flat may sound like a poor job on niccol's part , it actually enhances the meaning behind the story .  ethan hawke has developed into a handsome adult actor , giving his best performance of his lifetime so far .  his curiosity and motivation pushes his character past all the discouraging remarks from his parents and "" valid "" peers .  uma thurman is . . . well , uma thurman .  her character is slightly underdeveloped , but the story isn't about her .  however , thurman gives a lot of depth to the flat character .  jude law gives the most complex performance of the film with the most disturbingly realistic character .  he provides several nice touches , and his final scene is a very touching and heartwrenching one .  loren dean gives a nice performance in his well-developed character .  dean is also responsible for some of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie .  alan arkin portrays one of the detectives with a little less more excitement than with his psychiatrist in grosse pointe blank .  still , he does a good job .  gore vidal and xander berkeley both provide some very good supporting roles , and berkeley also gives a heartfelt discussion towards the end of the film .  gattaca is rated pg-13 for brief violent images , language , some sexuality , and nudity .  despite the somber and desolate mood of the entire film , i wasn't exactly prepared for the ending which left me feeling empty .  it turned me off slightly , but then i realized that everything turned out the way it should have .  if this had been a typical hollywood film , it would have ended much differently .  however , with all the mindless science fiction films out there , it is nice to have a film which doesn't talk down to its audience ( i especially like the ironic title and how it consists of the four letters which make up the genetic coding : g , t , c , and a ) .  instead , it provides some much needed entertainment which gives us science fiction fanatics just what we want : a science fiction film with morals behind it .  whatever happened to giving the audience a lesson while entertaining ?  hopefully more writers and directors will learn from gattaca . . .  and hopefully audiences will too .  p . s . personal note to p . j . gladnick : how dare you call this film the worst film of the year .  i can't even begin to image what film you do like .  that frightens me beyond anything .

There is dissatisfaction with the lack of quality in most science fiction films and concern about the lack of advertising for ""Gattaca"" and its potential performance at the box office. However, there is recognition of the intelligence, production design, and plot of the film."
1|"it must be some sort of warped critical nightmare : the best movie of the year would be a summer vehicle , a jim carrey vehicle at that .  and so it is .  _the truman show_ is the most perplexing , crazed , paranoid and rib-tickling morality play i've seen since i-don't-know-when .  don't credit carrey .  it starts with andrew niccol ( gattaca ) , who created the script ten years ago .  the story , replete with sublte religious and philisophical undertones , is about a man who discovers that every day of his existence has been televised for a mass audience .   ( ironically , it was within these past ten years that "" reality-based "" television have become a predominant fixture into our culture .  who knew ? )  one-upping niccol , it was when unlikely candidate-director peter weir took the helm that things fell into place .  weir had the nearly impossible task to create the unimitible tone , deftly mixing capra with kafka , throwing george bailey in a universe inhabited by rod serling .  it was weir's first stroke of genius to create seahaven : a suburban paradise/prison that would make spielberg cower in shame .  for example , bystander-extras would walk around the block incessantly with flowers along with the latest issue of _dog fancy_ .  the nicest touch are the plethora of subtle hints for truman to _not_ leave the island .  credit weir for his second stroke : the casting of carrey .  carrey seems to be the type of character actor who would always turn "" on "" and act goofy whenever the camera is near .  not here .  his performance is so subverted you sometimes wonder if he is ever aware the camera is on .  and although carrey does not deserve an academy award nomination ( just as well , the academy rarely honors goofy comedians , excepting robin williams ) , he stretches enough to alter his hyper-silly image considerably .  playing one who has the cameras constantly invading his most intimate moments turns to be quite the role of jim carrey's life .  no pun intended .  better in a smaller , more pivotal role is ed harris as christof , who mixes the right amount of his apollo 13 "" work the problem , people "" character with dustin hoffman's megaglomaniac producer in _wag the dog_ , and then only slightly svengalian .  it is clear that he is torn between the nielson ratings and truman's well being .  yes , in his own misguided way he loves truman as a father to a son , and has provided the best universe he could provide .  he thinks .  rounding out the cast is natascha mcelhone ( mrs .  dalloway ) as carrey's true "" forbidden love "" , sylvia , very effective in another pivotal small role .  laura linney ( congo ) and noah emmerich ( copland ) have the unfortunate task of playing truman's wife and best friend ; their sitcom-ish dialogue allow little room for any authentic character development .  the exception is at the very beginning , where they speak into the camera , wholeheartedly believing that their participation is truly good for truman , and for society in general .  there are other little problems with the script .  are we to assume that toddler truman had no recollection of hearing the construction of such a gigantic dome during his formative years ?  was there any reason as to why in one scene , it rained solely on truman , even though it never had to ?  how is it they hire hundreds of extras , and none of them could drive a boat , and yet truman , fearful of water , is helming a sailboat effortlessly ?  and couldn't christof have turned off the wind , to strand truman at sea ?  these little contrivances , however , do not hold a candle to the overall effect of the work .  the audience gets the feeling that it is watching the actual show , and we are drawn to truman's mundane existence for no other reason than it is there .  the final result effortlessly combines the emotional happy ending of a mainstream picture with a gnawing discomfort that hits you square in the gut .  upon leaving the theater , i was looking up in the sky , wondering if it was nothing more than a gigantic dome .  just checking .

1|now , lets first look into the history of shark films .  there was the unforgettable jaws .  the exciting jaws 2 . the rather flaky jaws 3d and sometime in the late 90s another film of the same genre that i can't seem to recall ( about the son of jaws returning to wreak revenge or something like that ) .  now , with the magic of cgi , one shark is simply not enough ; in deep blue sea , there are 3 big , mean and really smart ones !  russell frankiln ( jackson ) visits aquatica ( a sea-bound research center ) , where a research is being conducted on the extraction of a hormone substance found uniquely within the shark brain that can cure and reverse the effects of alzheimer's disease .  the substance is small in quantity and because of this , lead researcher dr . susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans , naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones .  as sure as the sun sets in the west , a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure .  with the flexibility offered by cgi , the sharks get more full-length screen time as their predecessors did in those remote-controlled rubber suit days .  gone are the days of people getting pulled under the water with the water turning red right after .  this time , we get to see the entire gobbling action , with floating limbs and all .  so-so acting , expected in most of your average action film .  jackson ( fresh from his jedi master role in the phantom menace ) , takes on the dark-side force of a different kind and fits well with his wise-cracking lines .  ll cool j's cook role as preacher , does for this film what steven seagal's cook could only dream to achieve in his two under siege films .  deep blue sea does not offer any of the psychological thrills that jaws has to offer .  it does however , prove to be a refreshing follow-up within the genre , full of visual thrills , suspense and believe it or not  humour !  its like jurassic park under water .  nothing too stressful , pure entertainment .  renny harlin , you are forgiven ( for making cutthroat island ) .  |0.43333333333333335|0.7666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive, as they describe the film as exciting, refreshing, and full of visual thrills.

1|"this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday .  jon bennet ( played by andrew howard ) is an extremely good assassin .  as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him .  he has become an unquestioning weapon .  he is in the employ of a kingpin ( david calder ) far more evil than he is .  but even assassins have innocent pasts .  he runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school .  complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime .  a big piece of what makes this film work is the depiction of the kingpin .  calder is a familiar actor in britain , though not frequently seen in the us .  he was seen in the world is not enough .  here he creates one of the best screen villains in recent years .  he is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake .  his lair is underground , apparently in a sewer , where he lives like the king of sewer rats .  it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet's life .  paul sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin's lair , he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness .  by using semi-darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world .  this is a world that is cold and unfriendly .  sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see .  this is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach .  we see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that .  the screenplay is by peter waddington based on the novel by neil cross , but it is sarossy's film all the way .  it creates indelible images of evil .  i rate it an 8 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +3 on the -4 to +4 scale .

( how exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybody's guess . )  as it happens , thanks to a visiting schoolboy's prank , his body is temporarily misplaced , and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it .  as time ticks away before his memory cube self-destructs , the frantic search for his body is on . . . while  fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world , then finds there's no better way to hack the system than from the inside .  during the chaos , computer technician apollonia james ( linda griffiths ) maintains contact with fingal through a datalink , manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings .  over the course of their interactions , interest on both their parts grows into a budding romance .  given that "" casablanca "" is fingal's favorite film , and the basis for his fantasy world , a great deal of the movie is homage to "" casablanca "" .  in fact , the humphrey bogart and peter lorre characters make appearances ( played by julia in a dual role and louis negin , respectively ) in a bar called "" the place "" .  julia's portrayal of bogart is passable , and avoids becoming the "" schweethaat "" -spouting parody seen in cartoons .  negin's peter lorre is quite credible , and easily the best peter lorre i've ever seen who wasn't the real thing .  the two of them , as characters created by fingal's imagination , serve as aspects of his personality , driving him on in his quest to hack the computer system .  those aren't the only casablanca characters to put in appearances .  the sydney greenstreet character also happens to be around . . . as "" the fat man "" , the alternate aspect of the film's main villain , the novicorp chairman ( donald c . moore ) .  while fingal's body is lost , the fat man tries to stop him from hacking the system . . . with  less than salutory results .  it's interesting to note the futuristic slang words that are thrown about left and right during the film , in the best golden-age science fiction tradition .  words like "" dopple "" , "" psychist "" , "" computech "" , "" cinema "" , and "" reconst "" are apparently in common use .  and while people of today may well laugh at fourteen years past's idea of futuristic data processing clerks , some aspects of this film are surprisingly perfectly in keeping with the way we think of "" virtual reality "" today .  as cyberpunk films go , this may not be a staple of the genre , but it's definitely recommended viewing .  the special effects are very primitive , placing this production in the realm of low-to-medium-budget television .  the music is completely electronic-synthesized , which fits the low budget but isn't really out of keeping with the genre .  however , the writing quite makes up for it .  there are some very funny moments , and quite a few little in-jokes that one needs to have seen "" casablanca "" to appreciate properly .  all in all , i give "" overdrawn at the memory bank "" a .
