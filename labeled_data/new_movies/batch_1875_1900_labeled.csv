0|"a life less ordinary ( r ) while the extremely peculiar a life less ordinary does live up to its title , a more appropriate moniker would be a movie more misguided , for this confused , confusing attempt at romantic comedy is a most disarming disaster from the talented trainspotting team of director danny boyle , producer andrew macdonald , and screenwriter john hodge .  at the core of this strange film is a fairly basic--and , yes , ordinary--premise .  after robert ( boyle regular ewan mcgregor ) , an aspiring writer of trashy novels , is fired from his janitorial job at the naville corporation , he kidnaps naville's ( ian holm ) spoiled daughter celine ( cameron diaz ) and holds her for ransom .  the joke here is that celine is a willing victim--her father threatened to cut her off financially , so she wants revenge--and that she soon becomes not only an accomplice but the brains behind the scheme , teaching the inept robert a thing or two about kidnapping . . .  and , ultimately ( didn't we see this one coming ? ) ,  love .  so far , so mediocre .  but mediocre is better than dreadful , which this film is , thanks in no small part to the hodge's contextual frame for the romance .  it turns out that god is displeased with the divorce and romantic breakup rate on earth , so the chief of heaven's police , gabriel ( dan hedaya ) dispatches two angels , o'reilly ( holly hunter ) and jackson ( delroy lindo ) , to earth to hook up celine and robert--or lose their angel status .  this conceit might have worked if the angel dimension played an integral role in the entire picture .  but it could have easily been cut without any clear loss to the film ; as it stands , it is simply a waste of time that distracts from the romance at hand .  not that there is much of a romance to begin with .  try as diaz and mcgregor may , celine and robert are too one-note to become very endearing characters .  celine is rich bitch ; robert is a dullard .  as such , it is quite hard for the audience to really connect with these two--then again , they never seem to really connect with each other .  when celine and robert start to overtly act on their "" feelings , "" it comes off more like something scripted than anything natural .  but i am not exactly sure if boyle and company's point was romance ; honestly , i am not exactly sure what they were trying to accomplish .  boyle juices up the visuals with his characteristic razzmatazz , but it remains just that--energy , not energy in service of a story or even acting .  the cast seems lost , especially hunter , whose performance is so adrift as to be baffling .  and then there are the many eccentricities splattered onto the film : some violent confrontations involving the angels , who are not exactly angelic--in fact , they end up staging their own ransom scheme ; some mystical hokum in the climax ; and a cutesy claymation epilogue .  watching much of a life less ordinary is like being trapped in indie hipster hell , stockpiling quirks in the name of cool .  instead , the film just gives quirky a bad name .  my best guess as to what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish is an atmosphere of warped womantic ( yes , misspelling intended ) whimsy , which comes through in only one scene : an extended musical number where celine and robert sing "" beyond the sea "" at a karaoke bar .  after a verse or two , the couple are magically dolled up in snazzy outfits and hairdos , and engage in a spirited dance routine on the counter .  the scene works not only because of its relative simplicity but also because it does not try too hard , just relying on the innate charm of the leads , allowing them to build a romantic rapport .  alas , not nearly enough is built , for this moment comes to an abrupt end .  i applaud any attempt to bring something fresh and unique to movie houses , but sometimes even cleverness can reach overkill .  a life less ordinary certainly delivers something "" different , "" but by the time the film was over , i was clamoring for a life more ordinary .

0|the corruptor is a big silly mess of an action movie , complete with pointless plot turns and gratuitous violence .  it's not abhorrent , or even blatantly unlikable , but it doesn't make a shred of sense .  and whose idea was it to have the director of glengarry glen ross direct an action film ?  james foley knows a lot about characters and acting , and those are the strengths of the corruptor .  but the quiet scenes clash with the ludicrous action nonsense , and the result is less like a movie and more like a derailed train .  at least we have chow yun-fat in the lead role .  chow plays nick chen , a chinatown cop .  he's a good cop , as the first few scenes establish , and he's very familiar with chinatown .  that's probably why the powers-that-be decide to team him up with a rookie named danny wallace ( mark wahlberg ) .  nick and danny begin by stepping on each other's toes , but finally end up liking each other once they both get a chance to save the other one's life .  what happens after that is kind of a mystery to me .  i'm fairly certain that the villains are all part of the fukienese dragons , led by a young chinese psycho named bobby vu ( byron mann ) .  i'm also pretty sure that nick is on the payroll of henry lee ( ric young ) , a gangster dealing in prostitutes and other neat stuff .  i'm not quite sure why henry lee decides to employ danny , although this makes for some ridiculous ( albeit unpredictable ) plot twists along the way .  there's also an interesting subplot revolving around danny's father ( brian cox ) , but it doesn't have much to do with the main story .  one of the problems , as i said , is that the movie doesn't make any sense .  i don't blame this entirely on foley , because he's obviously a good director .  i'm more inclined to point my finger at robert pucci's script , which doesn't seem to be in tune to the way normal people act .  one scene early on had me particularly annoyed : nick confronts his boss because he's angry about his new white partner .  he's shouting and pointing his finger and stepping on the furniture , and i was thinking that i would have fired him if he had done that to me .   ( in addition , the film takes a bite into race-related issues , and never develops them at all . )  there are a lot of scenes like this one , and none of them are very coherent .  there's also a considerable language barrier , given that chow and some of the other actors have thick chinese accents .  the plot itself never straightens out .  i'm not sure who or what the fukienese dragons are , or why henry lee is associated with them , or what they do as a group .  the corruptor is an action movie , and so all these weird plot developments are decorated with loud and violent action sequences .  the sequences aren't bad , but they're not new ; how many car chases through chinatown have you seen ?  on that note , how many chinatown cop movies have you seen ?  one too many , i'd imagine .  foley's strength is clearly in characterization , and he does a pretty good job here .  the scenes between nick and danny are very good , and i actually got a feel for their characters ; a bond forms between them that holds parts of the film together .  chow and wahlberg are both good actors ; chow is a pro , and can do this kind of stuff in his sleep .  wahlberg seems less at home in this atmosphere , but he's still fun to watch .  i also liked the subplot involving danny's father ; brian cox's performance is powerful , and his character makes a compelling moral compass for danny .  but the film ultimately fails , mostly at the hands of insane incoherence and overly-familiar action scenes .  a complicated plot can be successful , but the story needs to make sense when it's over .  the corruptor never manages to make any sense -- it just keeps spinning out of control until , finally , there's nothing left to hold on to .  |-0.4333333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.7999999999999999|"The text provides a negative sentiment towards the movie ""The Corruptor"" by describing it as a ""silly mess"" with ""pointless plot turns"" and ""gratuitous violence"".

0|" "" return to horror high , "" wants to be a couple different types of movies at once .  the film tells the story of a low-budget horror movie being filmed at the closed-down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before .  but what the cast and crew don't know is that a real killer , maybe the same one that was never apprehended , is going into action again .  on one level , "" return to horror high "" is a slasher movie , and it is at this level that it works the best on .  watching the film , which was made in 1987 , i couldn't help but take notice that the killer's costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in , "" scream , "" and "" scream 2 .

0|"seen december 2 , 1997 at 6 : 50 p . m . at the glenwood movieplex cinemas ( oneida , ny ) , theater #3 , by myself for free ( free pass ) .  [theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture]  there are many philosophies as to why we are so fascinated with cartoons .  they provide a method of total escapism in which anything will work within their context , from the outrageous slapstick of looney tunes to the intensity of japanimation .  watching "" flubber "" really clinched this idea for me , because it's just a live action cartoon that presents itself as a regular comedy .  it proves how painfully unfunny all those gags and slapstick would be in reality , and how important it is to actually have a story .  the film wastes no time in establishing its lighthearted , cartoony atmosphere .  we meet medfield college chemistry professor phillip brainard ( williams ) , the typical , supposedly likable mad scientist .  within the first 10 minutes we get at least a half dozen jokes about how forgetful he is .  phillip's memory loss seems less like a cartoony gag and more like a real case of alzhiemer's disease - isn't this rather lowbrow comedy ?  he starts teaching chemistry after walking in on a nude figure drawing class ( an inappropriate joke for a kids' movie if i ever saw one ) .  we learn he has stood his up fiancee , sara ( harden ) , twice at the altar simply because he's forgotten .  sara claims to love him , but says if he forgets the wedding again she'll stop loving him ( a sign of childish attitude the film denies it has ) .  but even cartoons must have conflicts to resolve , and it's no surprise the major conflicts here are related .  christopher mcdonald does and even worse version of his usual villain shtick as wilson croft , a scientist who not only wants to steal phillip's ideas , but his woman too .  what's worse is that sara actually seems interested in him !  wilson works for a rival college that wants to buy out medfield , which is going broke , unless phillip can invent something to save the day .  one of the first rules of filmmaking is to make sure the title has something to do with the film .  the flubber is played for gags after it is introduced , but is all but forgotten about thereafter .  it's obvious phillip is going to accidentally invent flubber , a flying rubber compound that yields tremendous energy , and the promotions make the flubber look realistic and funny .  unfortunately , the flubber , like all the special effects in this film , looks very fake and unconvincing .  flubber also seems to have intelligence and a personality , and by the time it performs a song and dance routine , you give up wondering how life could spontaneously come to an inanimate object .  most of the film wanders aimlessly as it relies on the flubber to make for the comedy ( since phillip's absent-mindedness is forgotten about ) and somehow push the story along .  but it's clear how weak this premise is from the get-go and the film just gets worse .  all the jokes involve people getting hit by fast-moving , flubber-powered objects including : bowling balls ; flying cars that don't fly well ; and a basketball team capable of jumping 100 feet into the air .  it's all presented with complete logic , and no one believes flubber exists even when they see it with their own eyes .  during the basketball scene , the coach for the rival team actually says , "" i think they might be cheating , "" to which the referee replies , "" there's no rules about jumping too high . ""   "" predictable "" doesn't begin to describe the motions the film goes through , especially after the halfway point .  and it's not how terribly contrived the plot is , it's the way it's broken down scene-by-scene , with absolutely no transition .  not only that , but all the actors here , especially williams , seem bored to tears .  i'd say 80 percent of all the scenes were shot with a bluescreen , so it's almost forgivable when you realize they're talking to nothing and interacting with nothing .  it's safe to say everything that could be bad about "" flubber "" is .  the only original element the film has is the world's first romance between a machine and a human .  but this aspect is quite twisted if you think about it , and , like the rest of the film , you won't .

0|"some movies' pre-release buzz is so insistent on their high oscar potential that when they're finally released , everyone just goes along with it .  thus sometimes , films unworthy of any award sans the razzie become oscar hopefuls and some even score nominations .  last year it was the thin red line .  this year's "" winner "" is the hurricane , pure unadulterated tripe that is all of a sudden being received with critical plaudits and votes in the office oscar pool .  acclaimed director norman jewison's biopic retreads all the conventions of courtroom movies without any of the fun .  and that's supposed to be ok because , see , it's a true story .  it's about rubin "" hurricane "" carter ( denzel washington ) , a legendary african american prizefighted who is unjustly convicted of triple homicide with the help of a ghastly ( racist ! )  detective ( dan hedaya ) who's had it in for the "" big-shot "" hurricane ever since he arrested him for stabbing a white man with a knife ( in self-defense but who cares , right ? )  when rubin was only ten .  he is to serve three life sentences with no possibility of parole .  most of the film takes place when he is in his 15th year in prison .  to the rescue -- lesra martin ( vicellous reon shannon ) and his team of wanna-be detectives .  lesra is an african american teenager taken in by three well-off canadian white people ( hanna , unger , schreiber ) to get an education .  lesra and his buddies go to a book sale where lesra picks out his very first book -- "" the sixteenth round , "" rubin's autobiography .  immediately thereafter , schreiber's character tells lesra "" sometimes we don't pick the books we read , they pick us . ""  hmmm .  after a few visits to the prison , they become convinced of rubin's innocence and launch their own full-scale investigation even though two juries have convicted him .  they meticulously go through all the files and revisit all the old witnesses ( i wonder if any of them might be cranky old women who slam the door in their faces ? ) and in the course of their relentlessy tedious sleuthing uncover obvious evidence confirming the hurricane's innocence that was either ignored or never seeked out during the first two proceedings .  of course , we're already told that he's innocent .  a movie like this is especially frustrating because we're not being shown everything significant that happened to carter during this period in his life .  all too obviously , we're getting the hollywood watered- down version .  that would be ok except that the parts we are getting is milked for every single drop of melodrama that the filmmakers could possibly squeeze out of it .  it's almost cruel .  the melodrama isn't of the entertaining kind either ; it's the hokey , rammed-down-your-throat variety where every emotion is exaggerated to the point of absurdity .  witness the villain ferociously grinding his teeth at the final trial or the constant pseudo-saintliness of our four protagonists .  the hurricane is your basic courtroom movie except it's a no-frills courtroom movie .  it's formula stripped to the bare necessities .  you have your wrongly accused black man .  you have your melodramatic final courtroom scene .  but there's nothing else .  you'd expect some sort of involving investigation .  but that's not necessary since we're implicitly informed of his innocence .  thus the whole middle portion of the movie is reduced to the protagonist brooding .  brooding to himself .  brooding to other inmates .  brooding to lesra .  brooding to lesra's canadian friends .  brooding in letters .  i don't think i'll ever look at brooding the same way again .  it wasn't long before i got tired of hearing the hurricane's exceedingly deep meditations on his condition .  i wanted something to happen .  as for washington's performance in the title role -- i figured i'd have to address it sooner or later considering the amount of attention it's received -- he is top notch , though still boring .  how is that possible ?  well , he does what jewison wanted him to do perfectly .  unfortunately what jewison asked him to do is a load of crap .  what a waste of a great performer .  speaking of wastes , why the hell did john hannah agree to do this ?  he's an extremely talented actor and i love him dearly , but what is he doing here ?  to call his character ( along with schreiber's and unger's ) a stick figure would be a gross understatement .  all three of them come off as veritable mother theresas , as benevolent as do-gooders come .  if they're to play a major part in this movie , why not make them real people , with real feelings and emotions ?  look : if you're going to make a formula movie , don't undermine the formula .  courtroom dramas can be fun , but this is ridiculous .  not only is it trite , it's boring .

0|depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line .  new line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons .  the fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ .  it also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself .  this time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico .  by all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border .  one is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) .  calling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side .  but smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them .  viewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations .  there is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire .  director walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture .  what he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction .  yes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling .  the problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters .  they were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status .  with john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive .  it feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work .  the narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence .  even if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction .  willis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else .  christopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression .  with no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about .  cinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration .  sometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about .  in the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about .  |-0.01666666666666668|0.7999999999999999|0.8166666666666668|"The summary explanation is that the sentiment of the text is slightly negative, as the reviewer criticizes the film ""Last Man Standing"" for its lack of originality, ineffective voice-over narration, and lack of compelling characters and antagonist."

0|"i went to blair witch project 2 : book of shadows with the highest of hopes .  the original film , released last summer , was genuinely scary and terrifying ; i hoped that this movie would live up to its predecessor .  unfortunately , my hopes were soon dashed .  as the movie opens , the audience is shown pseudo-documentary clips of burkittsville , maryland residents being interviewed about the sudden tourist influx to their town as a result of the original blair witch project movie .  it's a mostly humorous , self-aware poke at the media hype and hysteria surrounding the first film .  during this segment , we are introduced to the protagonist , a young man who sells blair witch-related memorabilia from his website .  the movie then cuts to a title that informs us that what we are about to see occurred one year previously .  we see the same young man that was selling blair witch paraphernalia , but now he is confined in a mental institution the sort of which one only finds in bad horror movies .  we see him having some sort of disgusting white goo unconvincingly forced down his nose while a cigarette-smoking doctor luridly leers above him .  we see him throwing himself wildly around a padded room ; we see him cowering naked in a shower stall as a fire hose is turned on him .  no explanation is provided for why he is in the mental institution ; in fact , these scenes are barely referred to again .  i had a sinking feeling during these opening scenes ; generally , a hospital scene that is set with poor lighting , filthy interiors , and evil doctors is a sure sign that you are in the throes of a truly horrible movie .  the movie cuts again , this time to the present .  the young man , whose name is jeffrey ( played by jeffrey donovan -- as in the first movie , the character names are identical to the actors' names , although this movie admits up front that it is fictional , so there's no reason for the practice this time around ) , is rounding up a group of people that he will be leading into the woods that weekend for the "" blair witch hunt , "" which is a promotional gimmick he came up with and sells on his website .  we meet tristen and steven , a young couple who are writing a book about the blair witch experience .  steven is a skeptic , believing the whole thing to be the result of mass hysteria .  tristen , on the other hand , believes that there may be some truth to the rumors of supernatural occurrence .  she is wan and soft-spoken ; she complains that the radio is playing too loudly .   ( she also complains that she feels nauseated ; i knew immediately that the character was pregnant , and my intuition was confirmed a few scenes later when kim psychomagically susses it out .  how did i know ?  because in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant . )  the fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil .  they pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery .  kim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch .  presumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it's never explained .  the party of five heads off into the woods as promised .  they reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr's house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night's events .  there is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere .  the movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down .  sexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens .  this would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary .  the next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen's manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow .  the videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , "" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! ""  ooh .  spooky .  the team goes back to jeffrey's house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes .  they soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night .  wacky hijinks ensue .  tristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket .  throughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about "" reverse , "" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards .  when they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours .   ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes .  okay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves . . . oh ,  nevermind . )  this movie was awful .  simply awful .  the characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development .  erica is the nature-loving wiccan .  tristen is the weak and sympathetic woman .  steven is the overbearing asshole .  kim is the antisocial goth girl .  old , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures .  how do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ?  because she's pregnant !  how do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ?  because she wears a lot of eye makeup !  how do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ?  because he has jagged teeth and talks like he's straight out of "" deliverance "" !  this is weak storytelling at its worst .  rather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics , in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action .  it didn't work .  on top of being poorly developed , most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid .   ( "" honey , you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie .  let's get on a plane home . ""   "" no .  i am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what's going on . ""   "" ok . "" )  frankly , by the end of the movie , i was rooting for the witch .  i also felt that there was simply too much blood 'n' gore in this film .  the first movie worked by never showing us the horror .  the witch was a palpable presence in that movie , but we never saw it ; we never saw anything , in fact .  the horror was all off-screen , and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be .  this is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie .  blair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out .  this was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey's throat , and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort .  knives plunge into flesh , bloody fingers trail off into the darkness , and none of it is explained until the very end , when it was too late for me to care .  this movie didn't stop with showing us the gore , either ; it went for broke and showed us everything .  by the end of the movie , there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours .  it is all explained ; in fact , it is all shown on-screen in loving detail .  i confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster , or see only brief glimpses , mere suggestions of what the monster is ; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying , but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying .  i have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no "" monster , "" that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind .  i found this to be a miserably poor explanation ; if it was in fact the director's intent , then he needs to have some words with the writer , because it was not made clear at all .   ( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds ; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so .  and if there was no witch , then what about the vanishing tree ?  the snowfall of manuscript paper ?  hm ? )  blair witch 2 : book of shadows was a horrible movie .  from the poorly-written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross-out shots , it was a bad effort through and through .

0|i'm giving this stinker .  normally , the worst that i would ever rate a movie would be .  but the total waste of time that is blazing saddles is , compounded by the fact that this movie is incredibly offensive , helped me come to the big goose egg .  i'm not sure what the hell mel brooks was thinking when he made this thing , or if he was even thinking at all .  maybe in mel's little mind a horse being knocked unconscious because of a punch to the face is funny .  in mine , it's not .  or maybe mel graduated from the spike lee school of filmmaking .  because only the self-righteous lee uses the n-word more often in his films than brooks did in this one .  at least lee has the smarts to realize that nobody is going to find that term amusing .  brooks bandies it about like he figures the audience will be rolling in the aisles every time they hear it .  wrong mel !  i would call you a boob mel , but that insults breasts everywhere .  this idiotic attempt at a comedy centers on the evil lieutenant governor's ( harvey korman ) attempts to clear out a town so he can buy up the land cheap and sell it to the railroad .  he sends his goons to run the townsfolk out .  but the town appeals to the governor ( mel brooks in one of many uninspired , and unfunny roles ) to send them a new sheriff to protect them .  the governor pawns the task off to korman's character hedley lamarr .   ( i can tell you are rolling off your chairs right now just thinking of all the humor in that name . )  lamarr decides to send the town a black sheriff ( gasp ) in the hopes that the town will be so disgusted at the prospect of a black man living among them that they will all just leave .  hold on , i've got to stop while these gales of laughter pass .  it's just too funny .  racism passing as humor -- gosh why didn't anybody ever think of that one before ?  oh wait , i think somebody might have -- they are called the kkk .  i'm not calling brooks a racist -- but i am calling him an insensitive bastard who wouldn't know what was funny if it hit him over the head .  but i digress .  anyway , the black sheriff rides into town amid a flurry of townsfolk using the n-word .  golly , will the hilarity just never end ?  he ends up joining forces with a drunk ( gene wilder ) , who happens to be the former fastest gun in the west .  together , they save the day from evil .  not one person in this movie gives a decent performance .  wilder looks like he is recovering from a head injury for most of the movie , and korman looks embarrassed to be a part of the movie .  ok , he really didn't -- but he should have .  the films star cleavon little goes along with the black jokes as if they were discussing the time of day .  i did not laugh once during this whole sorry experience .  i admit to starting to snicker on a couple of occasions .  actually , the end started to look as if it was going to have some promise , but alas , it ended up being as crappy as the rest of the movie .  i can say with full confidence that blazing saddles has no redeeming qualities whatsoever .  mel brooks would be doing the world a favor if he burned every last copy of this film .  |-0.9166666666666666|0.9166666666666666|0.9166666666666666|"The reviewers have a highly negative sentiment towards the movie ""Blazing Saddles"", finding it offensive, unfunny, and racist, with poor performances and lacking redeeming qualities."
0|2 days in the valley is more or less a pulp fiction knock off .  it basically involves how a bunch of quirky characters in the los angeles area end up having their lives become intertwined in some very unusual ways .  i'm not going into much greater detail than that , since it would take forever to explain , and quite frankly , i'm not willing to spend any more time on it than the 2 hours that i've already wasted .  while it tries very hard to be pulp fiction , 2 days in the valley falls way short .  this is quite a condemnation considering the cast includes danny aiello , james spader and jeff daniels .  while the story isn't much , and the dialogue and characters rate only marginally better , 2 days in the valley does have a couple of bright spots .  james spader's character , while not much better than the rest , is at least fun to watch in a sick sort of way .  and we do get to see a nice cat fight between uber babes teri hatcher and charlize theron ( in her first role ) .  you know a movie isn't that good when the highlight is a brawl between two women .  even if they are both gorgeous .  i will give the writers some credit for the fairly clever ways in which they managed to intersect the lives of this group of characters that would have otherwise never interacted .  but marveling at that ingenuity is a far cry from actually enjoying the result .  while some of the characters and their respective stories are fairly interesting , they inevitably are brought down as they intersect with the other half of the characters that i really cared absolutely nothing about .  if i were to put a number on it , only about half of the story and half the characters in this movie were particularly interesting or otherwise enjoyable to watch .  this is the sort of movie that only a huge fan of one or more of the cast members should rent , and even then prepare for disappointment .  not even charlize theron being naked would get me to sit through this movie again .  or at least not all of it anyway .  |-0.71|0.8833333333333333|0.85|"The user's overall sentiment towards the movie ""2 Days in the Valley"" is negative, describing it as a disappointing knock-off of ""Pulp Fiction"" with average story, dialogue, and characters.
