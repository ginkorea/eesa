1|"losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing .  reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare .  while we all might feel the desire to blow someone's head off with a shotgun when they don't seem to grasp our point of view , actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid .  this isn't the case with sam baily - john travolta's slightly askew average-joe persona in mad city .   "" i don't think people listen to guys like me , "" sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum .  just a few days ago , sam was a guard at this same museum , but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position , sam's apprehension resulted in a brash decision .  in an effort to get his ex-boss , museum director mrs . banks ( blythe danner ) , to "" just listen "" , he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun , taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage .  sam's overall concern is valid enough - if he loses his job , his paycheck , his benefits , etc . , his wife and two children won't be provided for .  he's not a lunatic or a hot-tempered madman , he's somewhat like a child - panicky , compulsive , and running on emotion - and his naive intentions aren't helped any by the fact that banks wasn't overly compassionate with the let go .  overall , he's just like you and me - except that he has the capacity to view the line we'd deem "" far enough "" as the starting mark of some crazy race .  meanwhile , television reporter max brackett ( dustin hoffman ) is also on the scene .  covering a "" fluff "" story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks , max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest-breaking news story he ever could've hoped for .  having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting , max is anxious to turn this into his , and only his , story .  max immediately bonds with sam .  max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone .  at first , max's intentions don't stretch beyond high ratings and a good boost to the ole pride factor , but as he gets to know sam more personally , he begins to sympathize and even become somewhat of an advocate for him .  the media , however , is creating a frenzy that leaves the fickle public shifting gears as often as a diesel truck moving downhill .  the accidental shooting of ex-co- worker cliff ( bill nunn ) , a black security guard , becomes one of the main factors in the controversy over sam's honest ambitions .  also involved in this film are robert prosky as lou potts , head of the news department of the station max falls directly under , and alan alda as the nationally famed reporter kevin hollander , who uses his network power to try and outshine max .  alda and prosky both turn in fine performances that fit like gloves on their acting abilities .  then there is mia kirshner , who plays the young tv station intern laurie .  she falls under max's wings only to become a student taught too well in the way of sensationalistic reporting .  kirshner's credits are relatively small for now , including roles in films like exotica and the forgettable sequel to the crow .  still , kirshner's character transformation shows that she has shining ability to play both good girl and kinda-bitchy-in-a-reserved-way roles .  i wouldn't mind seeing her in some more prevalent parts , where perhaps her talent will be able to blossom more fully onscreen .  while the viewpoint of the media as a greedy , self-righteous monster has indeed been tackled before , mad city provides a solid two hours of enjoyability .  hoffman and travolta are both excellent actors , and seeing them together is a real treat .  they both do a great job at smoothly and naturally becoming their characters , and they provide enough chemistry for us to genuinely care for both .  there is quite a bit of humor in this film , and without it , it could've fallen into a drab , cliched social statement more likely to garner sleep from the audience than applause .  this isn't a flick that will grip at both your funny bone and your heart , but it will lightly touch both , making for a recommendable movie .  if for nothing more than the opportunity to watch both hoffman and travolta at the same time , i urge you to check this one out .

1|"as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left .  first , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : "" if you liked scream , you'll love wild things ! ""   "" campbell gives a stunning performance ! ""   "" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! ""   ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me )  now , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way ) .  wild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa .  i'm not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see .  however , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film's charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating .  being mormon , i'm bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film .  trouble is , i have already seen it .  and i like it !  wild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture .  the style in which it is filmed is rich in color .  the actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film .  sure , it's all too good to be true , but ain't it fun to watch ?  when movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it .  there will be people who don't want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it .  wild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into .  it's almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) .  of course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous .  immediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time .  we can turn off our brains , right ?  wrong .  while you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn't turn out that way .  the film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present .  there's sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students .  he's heading the class discussion .  there's also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam .  teaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about 'sex . . .   ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) ' .   "" what is a sex crime ? ""  ray asks .   "" not gettin' any ! ""  one student responds .  this pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch .  however , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body .  and so , wild things sets into motion .  quickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn't want anything to do with her advances .  kelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him .  she even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep .  surprisingly , that's really all i can tell you about the plot .  any more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists .  and what's more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable .  going along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film's surprises , and then adds even more to them .  there are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen .  and even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it's rather pleasing .  going back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief .  thankfully , the convoluted plot doesn't give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off .  as for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is .  this is pretty much just one trashy film .  however , it is the kind of trashy that isn't hard to watch .  it's good trash , in a sense .  one , the screenplay knows that it's not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story .  this varies everywhere from kelly's mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running .  bill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs .  and two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed .  wild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn't ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries .  instead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don't worry . . .  it's not as graphic as you might think ) .  the heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon's full-frontal nude scene .  it's very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it .  and , for as long as i can remember , i don't think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it's not completely , but judging from the audiences' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) .  also , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon's characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) .  what first made me want to see wild things was its cast .  neve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released .  here , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead .  the closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) .  campbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent .  you can tell she will be around for a long time .  denise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range .  here , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers .  hopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability .  and then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies .  she gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half .  towards the end she does get a bigger part .  on the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist .  kevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it .  you must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen .  and judging from many of the women's reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) .  and then there is bill murray .  his performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film .  as a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi .  director john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works .  his direction is smooth and stylish .  the visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air .  however , he seems more at home when the actors aren't talking .  his fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards' climbing out of the pool is a highlight .  the cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures .  then , there is the music .  this was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film .  it's hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it .  it's wonderfully composed and presented .  and be sure to stick around during the closing credits !  mcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) .  he has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events .  some may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it's an entertaining way to finish the film .  plus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun .  wild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence .  again , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let's face it--people want to see it .  so why not give it to them ?  neve campbell , admirably , has a no-nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) .  the sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands .  one almost wonders how they got away with the r rating .  the language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity .  and i can't stress it enough : don't allow kids under 18 to see this film .  the target age for the movie is the 18-24 range , and that's who should see it .  it's definitely not for those under 18 !  did i mention that this film is rated r ? however , for those that do get a chance to watch it , you will probably more likely be pleased , and may even take friends to see it the next time .

1|"the postman delivers but not first class  the postman a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman  [warning : my opinion of this film is definitely in the minority of reviewers perhaps because it hits so many of my cinematic buttons : post-apocalypse stories , hope in a desperate situation , grassroots uprisings and kevin costner .  even worse , i thought that "" waterworld "" was watchable .  read the following with those particular grains of salt . ]  it's the year 2013 and things have fallen apart .  due to a world war in the late nineties , the resulting three-year winter and a devastating plague , life in the former united states has been reduced to isolated primitive fiefdoms .  although this is the future , it looks like a western .  as the film opens , kevin costner ( his character's name is never revealed ) is wandering the utah wastelands with only his mule bill for company .  giving extraordinarily bad shakespearean performances in exchange for food and lodging , costner is an outsider in a land of outsiders .  running into even worse luck , he is forcibly conscripted into the racially pure holnist army of general bethlehem ( will patton ) .  the rag-tag retro-futuristic cavalry is the descendent of militia groups and is even called the "" clan ""  after a brutal boot camp , he ( and you can see this coming a mile away ) escapes .  taking shelter in a wrecked postal truck , he liberates the uniform and mail bag from the skeleton in the cab who no longer has a use for either .  once he reaches oregon , land of beautiful women , bright youngsters and rock and roll ; he pretends to be a representative from the "" restored congress of the united states of america "" .  this scam gets him inside the walled towns where the promise of mail delivery renews optimism in the hearts of the inhabitants .  food and other opportunities come his way in the form of spirited abby ( olivia williams ) who wants him to father a child because her husband is sterile .  shortly her husband is killed by bethlehem and she and the postman ( as costner is referred to for the rest of the film ) become a reluctant item .  although the postman knows he's running a fraud , the concept of renewed communications sets the kids' imagination afire ( especially ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , his second-in-command ) and they form a new pony express dedicated to getting the mail through .  the revived postal service doubles as an army to fight the holnists' tyranny .  the postman has become a symbol for hope in a rube goldberg manner .  although the movie appeals to my sensibilities , there are so many things wrong with it that they can hardly be counted .  it's derivitive of costner's own "" waterworld "" and clint eastwood westerns .  there's little here that we haven't seen dozens of times before .  the film is often down-right corny .  a scene where the postman is on horseback and grabs a letter from the hands of a bright-eyed child is embarrassing in its slow-motion banality .  the film's final few minutes should have been left on the cutting room floor .  despite the film's excessive three hour length , several things are never explained .  what was the war about ?  how did civilization change so rapidly ?  everyone has horses : where did all they come from ?  the "" law of eights "" that bethlehem lives by seems to have its origins somewhere beyond the film , but where ?  are we to believe that the rest of the world is in the same shape and hasn't made their way west to help or conquer ?  there is some jumbled symbolism here that doesn't appear to make sense .  the tale is obviously saying that communication can defeat evil in much the same way that the internet has the potential to topple governments , but beyond that there are some oddities .  the evil army is called "" holnists "" which sounds coincidentally like the new age "" holism "" , but why ?  is it another coincidence that it takes place in 2013 , just one year after many ancient prophesies ( including the ending of the mayan calendar ) predict a new world for mankind ?  why is the general named "" bethlehem "" ?  there seems to be some reason for that , but what ?  sometimes the movie feels like a joke .  an army of postal workers armed with guns ?  considering the headlines of recent years , it takes a tremendous leap of faith to cheer for these guys .  it's even more difficult to accept those re-powering the federal government as the heroes .  given the current climate of the country and the distrust of big government , it's asking a lot for the audience to get behind the film's nationalism .  even with its numerous flaws , the movie all comes together , if only for those who have the same weaknesses that i have .  it's doubtful that "" the postman "" is going to find much of an audience , but a few of us are going to have a good time .  besides we're all awaiting the fall of civilization caused by the year 2000 millennium computer bug .   ( michael redman has written this column for over 22 years and would like to announce that the "" michael redman "" arrested near indianapolis last week for accepting an illicit package from federal express is , to the best of his knowledge , not him .  perhaps this similarly-named person should have used kevin costner's postal service . )  "|-0.45|0.8333333333333334|0.7666666666666666|"The overall sentiment of these explanations is negative, as they highlight multiple criticisms of the film ""The Postman"", including its derivative and corny nature, lack of explanation for certain plot elements, and the difficulty in accepting the heroes as postal workers and supporters of big government."
1|"there are certain people in the world who have some talent that very few people have , but they chose not to take advantage of this for some personal reason .   "" good will hunting "" is about one of those people .  the will hunting of the ( horrible ) title ( let's face it , this film would be a bitch to title ) , played by co-writer matt damon , is a mathematical genius .  he can do almost any mathematical connundrum in about the time it takes to brew a cup of irish cream cappuccino .  and he works at mit . . . as the janitor .  one day , the professor of one of the most challenging courses , proffessor lambeau ( "" breaking the waves "" 's stellan skarsg ? rd ) , puts a big problem on the board for his students to attempt to complete .  the next day , it's already done on the board , but no one in his class claims to have done it .  so lambeau puts another problem on the board , this time one that took he and his colleagues over two years to prove .  and , duh , it's done again .  of course , they catch the guy who did it red handed - will .  before lambeau can find will again ( he ran away when he caught him ) , will has gotten into a fight with a bunch of punks on a basketball court , and struck a police officer , so lambeau gets him out on probation with two agreements : a ) he work with him on math , and b ) he get some therapy .  after going through some therapists whom he psyches out in one way or another ( for a hypnotist , he fakes being under his spell , then launches into an impromptu performance of the 70s classic , "" afternoon delight "" ) .  finally , lambeau's old college roomate , sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , a psych professor , agrees to treat him , and the two begin a rocky relationship , as sean tries to get will to open up .  turns out will had a rough childhood , being abandoned , and placed in foster homes and what not .  it also turns out that will does not want to do simple mathematics all his life ; he wants a challenge .  and that is to hang out with his buds ( including the other co-writer , ben affleck ) , and do honorable jobs , like construction .  is it right to make this genius follow in the footsteps of einstein and kasinsky ?  should this guy be forced to do something he doesn't want to do ?  this appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should .  i'm not saying "" good will hunting "" is a bad film at all .  it's a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it .  the acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together .  we also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will's love interest , skylar .  there are tons of individual moments that i adored .  i loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them .  i liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends .  there are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch .  and there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable .  like the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean's first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn't regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter .  however , the main flaw of the film is there's too much of everything , and not enough of it either .  the film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they're sometimes either overwritten or underwritten .  take for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face .  we hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times .  but this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do .  also , will's relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action .  we see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one .  their relationship never goes beyond "" just best friends , "" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human .  maybe it was just me .  and it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten .  and , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten .  we never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it's there for plot details that anything else .  minnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character .  the writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness .  sure , it feels overstuffed , but it's extremely enjoyable .  the dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human .  i think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing .  while this is probably director gus van sant's most conservative film ( you'd hardly know it's the same director of "" to die for , "" the only van sant film i've seen , really ) , it's still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what's this "" best picture "" deal ? ) .  and if a film puts a smile on my face despite posessing a lot of flaws , i have no problem with reccomending it to anyone .

1|"i guess it's a credit to jackie chan and the general likeability of the franchise that rush hour 2 could not be ruined even by the nauseating "" comedy "" of chris tucker .  i'm a fan of jackie chan in just about any medium , and this movie lets him not only do his impressive-as-ever martial arts schtick , but show off his comic timing as well .  it would have worked better if he was the only name above the title .  the plot is your basic martial arts flick clothesline for stunts and special effects .  this time around , the evil smugglers are led by ricky tan ( john lone ) , who makes his fortune by shipping counterfeit money into the united states ( i'm still not sure how you can make a fortune doing that : is there a place where one can exchange fake bills for real ones ? ) .  the only way to tell the phony money from the genuine article is to set it on fire and see what color it burns .  of course , it's up to hong kong detective lee ( chan ) and trash-talking lapd detective james carter ( tucker ) to take the bad guys out and the authorities , to the extent that they even exist , stay out of their way .  rush hour 2 turns the tables on the first film in that here it's carter who gets the two of them into trouble and lee who winds up having to get them out .  i guarantee that my rating would have been at least a half of a grade higher had anyone other than chris tucker been cast as the foil for jackie chan .  he refuses to shut up .  not only did his voice feel like a jackhammer on my head , but his jokes just aren't funny , a pathetic mixture of sub-par eddie murphy fasttalking blather and wannabe chris rock white-man-black-man jokes that wind up being more offensive than funny .  i realize that in a movie like this some of the biggest laughs come from letting the actors ad lib beyond what the script dictates , but didn't anyone realize how irritating tucker's incessant ranting and raving was ?  if this is all the comedian has to offer then i don't care to see any more of his films .  fortunately , chan makes for a marvelous straight man , and he redeems the fledgling comedy completely .  it's not often that one actor can so completely save a movie , but there is no other name for what he does ; whenever he's on screen , rush hour 2 comes to nearly breathtaking , often hilarious , life .  much of it hinges on the dubious value of how cute it is to watch chan try to be a "" player , "" but who cares ?  i can think of few high concepts that are funnier .  the movie ends with outtakes that , as usual , show that chan isn't perfect , and that it does , indeed , take him a few tries to get some of his incredible stunts to look seamless .  chris tucker botches some lines as well , and his mistakes are funnier than anything he says in the whole movie .  a lot of people have pointed out rush hour 2 isn't very different from its predecessor in tone or style .  but i liked the original , and i like the sequel , though a certain sidekick seems to have done his best to ruin it .  director brett ratner ( the family man ) keeps it moving at an entertaining pace and manages to keep the laughs coming despite the fairly miserable hit to miss ratio of the jokes ( i guess sometimes the shotgun approach works ) .  it's not great jackie chan , but it's jackie chan , and that's enough .  up next : jay and silent bob strike back  "|0.3333333333333333|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|The sentiment of the text is mixed.

1|"some critics , including siskel & ebert , are on the record stating that martin scorsese's raging bull , the story of boxer jake la motta , is the best film of the '80s .  since there are still a number of '80s films that i haven't seen , i don't feel qualified to make such a judgment , but i'll say this without hesitation : raging bull is a great motion picture , and i would be surprised if more than a handful of films released between january 1 , 1980 and december 31 , 1989 come close to its level .  bio-pics often fall into one of two categories : overblown hero- worship or a dry , dull textbook account .  it's rare that a movie with the moniker "" based on the life of ? "" comes across as anything more than sporadically energetic and marginally entertaining .  raging bull is the perfect counterexample , and a brilliant argument for film makers to continue to work in this genre .  the picture takes the life of boxer jake la motta , a middleweight icon from the '40s and '50s , and develops one of the most compelling character studies ever to reach the big screen .  for all 129 minutes , director martin scorsese and actor robert de niro ( in the title role ) have us mesmerized by this individual who is by turns sympathetic , sad , and horrifying .  historically , raging bull is said to be mostly accurately , with the lion's share of the details culled from la motta's own autobiography ( which was co-written with joseph carter and peter savage ) .  however , although la motta is credited as the movie's "" consultant , "" he was reportedly unhappy with the final result , because it portrays him as nothing short of an uncouth , insensitive lout .  the la motta of the movie is a man of extreme appetites who is driven by base , bestial impulses ? paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage .  sex and violence are inextricably linked .  the title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull .  in the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them .  outside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled .  the two people who spar with him on life's canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci ) .  these are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses .  he beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence .  raging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class .  over the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match .  meanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife .  vicki becomes jake's greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain .  his own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him .  hence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother .   ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : "" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? "" )  in the late '40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall .  he does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing .  two years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray .  by the late '50s and early '60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine .  raging bull is the other side of rocky .  sylvester stallone's tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 .  it won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production .  but , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring .  while scorsese's primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working .  rocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased .  there's little i can say here that hasn't already said about de niro's performance .  in a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding .  the level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering .  and , although there's a lot of travis bickle ( de niro's character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him .  this is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting .  as the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit .  as the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form .  how many actors would go that far ?  the best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance .  cathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) .  their portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro's .  pesci , who has basically re-created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother .  the misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed .  but , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it's startling to behold .  moriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake .  later , she's called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear .  scorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few "" home movie "" segments are in color ) .  the choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black-and-white approach is almost unheard of .   ( one important recent exception , schindler's list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . )  in black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese's choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing .  there's no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas .  during fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta's perspective .  scorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta's loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown .  after that , his career was all downhill .  yet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta's future .  the reason is obvious : scorsese isn't as interested in boxing as he is in the character .  following his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies .  we see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self .  who cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando's speech from on the waterfront ?   ( "" i coulda been a contenda . "" )  perhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the '80s .  and , if not , it's certainly perilously close to the zenith .

1|"much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of "" lolita , "" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it's important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit .  when seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation . . . well ,  you just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution .  what's even worse is that seeing this "" lolita , "" especially the first time and if you're familiar with anything "" lolita , "" is admittingly very anticlimactic .  this is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it's really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : "" flashdance , "" "" fatal attraction , "" and "" indecent proposal "" ) , at least besides "" jacob's ladder . ""  i've seen this "" lolita "" twice : the first time , i wasn't so blown away .  it seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting .  the second time , not really thinking about how i've waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i'm seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally .  the story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it's such a good novel , and why this is such a good film .  the story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it's not trash for the perverted but because it's about human obsession with things that are out of one's reach .  its protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies .  the character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can't live without .  these ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating .  the focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized .  the tone of the book is a comical one , but it's also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective .  humbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed .  we get a sense that perhaps it's by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed .  he weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita .  he lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her .  the story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace .  the weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him .  the opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn't done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ?  this is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn't possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general .  in that film , he used the traps of society as benefits .  the studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and  when you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession .  the censors wouldn't allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through .  looking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we've read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it's really impossible to compare them .  they both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was .  and although it's true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it's unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse .  i have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won't say that here .  however , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it .  it doesn't have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had .  some of that is in the casting of the two leads .  jeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert .  he's droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does .  he brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience .  and when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he's her prisoner for as long as he lives .  and dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible .  she pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character .  it's easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time .  when he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her .  there are two other minor characters in the film , one who's a road block in the beginning , and the other who's a reappearing threat to the relationship .  the former is charlotte , lolita's mother , played by melanie griffith .  in the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish .  and she's the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning .  as played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she's about half of them .  it's annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first .  and even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she's nothing more .  the other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price .  langella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original .  quilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk .  langella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of what we thought of him .  as you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise .  this version is beautiful , and perpetually saddening .  the camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich .  the acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita .  more importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it .  by the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he doesn't regret , we feel that we all lose to something we can never have .

1|"capsule : side-splitting comedy that follows its own merciless logic almost through to the end . . .  but not without providing a good deal of genuine laughs .  most comedies these days have one flaw .  they're not funny .  they think they're funny , but they are devoid of anything really penetrating or dastardly .  occasionally a good funny movie sneaks past the deadening hollywood preconceptions of humor and we get a real gem : ruthless people , for instance , which established a microcosm of a setup and played it out to the bitter end .  liar liar is built the same way and is just about as funny .  this is one of the few movies i've seen where i was laughing consistently almost all the way through : instead of a couple of set-pieces that inspired a laugh ( think of the dismal fatal instinct ) , the whole movie works like clockwork .  jim carrey playes a high-powered lawyer , to whom lying is as natural as breathing .  there is one thing he takes seriously , though : his son , and we can sense the affection that they have for each other right away .  but his wife is divorced and seeing another man , and now it looks like they may move away together .  the son goes with them , of course .  the movie sets up this early material with good timing and a remarkable balance of jim carrey's over-the-top persona with reality .  then the plot springs into action : after being snubbed ( not deliberately ) by his father at his birthday , the kid makes a wish as he blows out the birthday candles : that for just one day , dad can't lie .  he gets the wish .  what happens next is sidesplitting .  everything turns into a confrontation : when cornered by a bum for some change , he shouts , "" no !  i'm not giving you any money because i know you'll spend it on booze !  all i want to do is to get to the office without having to step over the debris of our decaying society ! ""  he can't even get into an elevator without earning a black eye .  and what's worse , he's now gotten himself into an expensive divorce settlement that requires him to twist the truth like abstract wire sculpture .  carrey , who i used to find unfunny , has gotten better at his schtick , even if it's a limited one .  he uses it to great effect in this movie .  there is a scene where he tries to test his ability to lie and nearly demolishes his office in the process ( there's a grin breaking out across my face right now , just remembering the scene ) .  he can't even write the lie ; his fingers twitch , his body buckles like someone in the throes of cyanide poisoning , and when he tries to talk it's like he's speaking in tongues .  equally funny is a scene where he beats himself to a pulp ( don't ask why ) , tries to drink water to keep from having outbursts in the courtroom ( it fails , with semi-predictable results ) , and winds up biting the bullet when he gets called into the boardroom to have everyone ask what they think of them .  this scene alone may force people to stop the tape for minutes on end .  the movie sustains its laughs and also its flashes of insight until almost the end .  a shame , too , because the movie insists on having a big , ridiculous climax that involves carrey's character flagging down a plane using a set of motorized stairs , then breaking his leg , etc . a simple reconciliation would do the trick .  why is this stupid pent-up climax always obligatory ?  it's not even part of the movie's real agenda .  thankfully , liar liar survives it , and so does carrey .  maybe they were being merciful , on reflection .  if i'd laughed any more , i might have needed an iron lung .

1|"maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it's not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively .  because it's not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it's so great .  underneath the to-die-for cinematography , the brilliant acting , and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty , not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it , tell it in a certain original way .  it doesn't merely go from plot point to plot point .  it goes from character to character .  it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship .  it's that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball , shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this , unlike "" patch adams , "" effortlessly emotional and real .  in short , this movie is just awesome .  it merely tells its story really well , and that's something that just has to be commended these days , when most stories are botched because they're not told by great storytellers .  director anand tucker tells this story well .  he overdramaticizes everything , but still keeps it real .  the film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr ? ( rachel griffiths and emily watson , respectively ) , two sisters who are first seen in childhood ( played by auriol evans and keely flanders , respectively ) as the very best of friends .  they are also both musicians , hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist , and when it all begins , both are considered child prodigies , but hilary is seen as the better of the two .  jackie , a bit jealous , works and works at her playing skills , and soon the tables are turned .  when they both hit adulthood , hilary strives for a comeback , while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world , but instead of fame , captures the heart of a hapless , joyful conductor , kiffer finzi ( david morissey , in a semi-star-making turn ) .  they marry , after a short courtship , and move to a lovely country house , making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life : when she plays , she has the eyes of the world , but when she stops , she's alone .  she enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist , daniel barenboim ( james frain ) , in hopes that she may overcloud her sister , but she eventually begins to lose it , and runs away to hilary's country home , where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband , since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure .  it's all terribly melodramtic , as you can see , and by the time jackie has contracted ms ( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi-smiliar "" shine "" in technical and emotional devastation ) , it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn't been handled in such a way .  the key thing here is that it's not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it's about her tumultuous relationship with her sister , which , i might add , is perfectly realized .  their relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year : they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world , but they're also completely jealous of one another .  when a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities , she tries in vain to make a comeback but can't , and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success .  when jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man , she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i've ever seen in a film ( only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man ) .  and the whole time , their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested .  another thing i really liked is emily watson's performance .  i usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease ( or any combination of the three ) .  my reasoning for this is that it's a fucking easy job .  the worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in "" beloved "" : sure , she's good , but what's so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around , slurs her words together , and acts like a three year old inside a 20-year old's body ?  hell , i could play that if i had a pair of breasts .  in that same exact movie , though , is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane , her brothers run off never to be seen again , and her mother's lover is scared off .  she has to actually deal with real emotions , something much harder than mere stumbling about .  but the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons .  if you don't believe me , look at jack nicholson's performance in "" as good as it gets "" : great performance , but easy job .  this isn't so for watson , though , because her insanity comes from real emotions , not just a plot point .  and thanks to the opening sequence , where we see her and hilary as kids , we understand the motives behind all her actions , and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life , we've already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses .  rachel griffiths , who would have otherwise been the understudy to watson's protagonist , actually matches watson step-for-step , because as watson grows insane , and demands unspeakable things from her , griffiths holds her own , and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her .  griffiths , an otherwise unknown actress ( and watson being famous from "" breaking the waves "" and "" the boxer "" ) , is absolutely brilliant , just as absolutely brilliant as watson is , and if the academy and all the other critics groups , who've already deemed watson's performance the best of the year , glance over hers because she's the one who doesn't get to go insane ( read : she gets the boring role ) , then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me .  after all , griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real - the tom cruise role in "" rainman "" ( the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman ) .  she does , and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year , it's griffiths .  together , the two actresses work extremely well , though , and both have to go through deep emotional hell , the likes of which haven't been seen this year .  if it hadn't been for an otherwise not-totally-great final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary ( when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety ) , i'd say this is one of the top ten best films of the year .  it's so close to perfection , in its structure , its treatment of its subject , and its beautiful technical specifications ( cinematography nomination , without a shred of doubt in my mind , and maybe film editing ) , that it's nearly a shame that it's not the flawless gem that it should be .  but , hey , as it is , i can hardly complain .

"" .  it's a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have .  it also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no "" let's have sex tonight "" mantra , if you'll excuse my bluntness .  this is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love .  hmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan "" hook up "" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness .  you know it's going to happen , the question is now ?  thankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids .  it's all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good .  hanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is .  he is , i believe , america's greatest actor .  does he show it here ?  nah .  but he's still tom hanks , and she's still meg ryan .  which is what this movie boils down to .  it's pure confection .  all the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it's all really sweet .  there are some immense flaws , like pacing .  the last third of the movie really doesn't work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it's slow .  once hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow .  i even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour .  the other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated .  e-mail ?  when my kids are my age , i don't know what we'll be using .  but hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history .  they just work together , and it's nice to see .  it gives you , well , a smile .  the script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake .  i was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was .  i've always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed .  you see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate .  movies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i'd rather not think about that .  i always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night .  and i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had .  hanks was the driving force behind one of the year's best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world .  he's also half of the glue behind the year's best example of pure entertainment .  tom hanks and meg ryan are magical , as is this movie .  it's a sweet , lovely affair with a technology twist .  it may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face .

1|"are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny ?  director/writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film "" next stop wonderland "" .  the two main characters , alan and erin , spend the entire movie in each other's orbit , catching glimpses of one another , yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion .  is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together ?  does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life ?  as the film starts , erin castleton ( hope davis ) , a melancholy 29- year old late shift nurse , is ending her live-in relationship with her boyfriend ( hoffman ) .  rather , he is ending it with her .  arriving home from work , erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment , car packed with his belongings .  in a fumbling , amusing and self deluding ramble , he instructs erin to watch a videotape he's made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he's leaving .  it's obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand , all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship .  he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief .  erin's mother ( holland taylor , in a surprisingly effective , small role ) , fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life , takes out a personal ad for erin .  to erin's embarrassed horror , the ad describes her as a "" frisky , cultured , carefree professional with a zest for life "" .  eventually , erin responds to the tidal wave of responses , which makes for some of the most humorous , telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and "" poseurs "" .  alan , a plumber and aspiring marine biologist , first spots erin as he's cleaning the inside glass of a fish tank at the boston aquarium .  wearing a wet suit and goggles , he follows erin from window to window , separated by the glass as erin , oblivious to his gaze , enjoys the fish .  later , we see him on a train as she sits on a platform outside , mere feet away .  the movie spends it's entirety having their paths circle each other without crossing .  there are several subplots involving alan .  one concerns his attempts to get on the job track at the boston aquarium , thereby escaping his apparent fate to carry on the family plumbing business .  another subplot involves his father's desperate attempts to force fate's hand by gambling away his life at the dog track .  a distracting focus is put on alan's debt to a loan shark and the manner in which he pays it off .  the movie tries too hard to make alan a likable guy .  thankfully , his dream- guy persona is counterbalanced by erin's distant , yet fundamentally hopeful , personality .  the film moves along at an unhurried pace , albeit too much so in the latter third , as we wait for the two to meet .  co-writers anderson and lyn vaus throw a couple of possible red herrings into the mix as the two find other possible relationships .  the films shifts into a much slower gear as we wait for these romances to blow over .  when alan and erin eventually do meet , we see that perhaps they both were destined for each other as they share a lingering , almost subliminally knowing , gaze .  it's a sweet , measured moment .  the disappointment comes in the fact that we've come to know the pair , yet we don't get to view their impending romance .  the film's inherent belief in the subtle persistence of fate and the wonder it can bring to one's life makes "" next stop wonderland "" a quiet pleasure in a cinematic landscape littered with explosions , shallow characters and overdone special effects .

1|"i'm an avid fan of the "" alien "" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) .  of course , that doesn't mean that i'm gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because "" alien : resurrection , "" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were .  however , it's a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series .  in short , i had a good time .   "" alien : resurrection "" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre's answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one .  of course , the last one wasn't very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn't financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) .  so back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that's a bad thing , but it's becoming a cliche ) .  so she's cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called "" the auriga "" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her .  once you get past the fact that you can't figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film's okay .  also on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won't state it , but unless you've been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it's nicely covered up ) .  there's a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it's never really deepened enough .  oh well .  well , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship .  and it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who's death is comical yet sad since , well , he's dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth .  of course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old "" alien "" -brand fun .  the real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there's always a bit of it , most notably in "" aliens "" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) .  what's interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach .   "" alien "" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights .   "" aliens "" is a wild , tense thriller .   "" alien 3 "" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir .   "" alien 4 "" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares .  jean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like "" das boot "" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat .  the chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there's the most tense surgery scene since "" face/off "" towards the beginning ) .  and not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that .  this all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others .  there are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed .  one is the aforementioned surgery scene .  another one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome .  the underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet's earlier film , "" delicatessen "" ) .  and the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to "" goldfinger "" ) .  but the best scene in the entire film ( i'm sure i'm not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an "" 8 "" tatooed on her arm ) .  it might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga .  the screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters .  however , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there's very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared .  and , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : "" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! ""  johner : "" well , i can get you off .  but not this ship . "" )  the acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in "" se7en "" who performed the "" lust "" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him .  winona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) .  of course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show .  playing a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable .  she's not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for "" aliens , "" but she's just awesome .  overall , it's a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn't really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment .  the style is the best part of the film , which isn't really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply .  but it's entertaining as hell , and it's definitely fit for the "" alien "" series .

1|"it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship , a green ovular pin , and the birth of oscar wilde , but if one really strains , they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off .  wilde's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature , and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned , loosing his family and his career .  the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise .  the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life ( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality ) , they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else .  and that's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began .  it's been said that todd haynes' "" velvet goldmine , "" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement , not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it , steals a lot from "" citizen kane , "" and that's true .  in the film , a british journalist in the 80s , arthur stuart ( christian bale ) , is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade , a fictitious rock star , who faked his own death on stage , bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement .  structure-wise , this totally steals from "" kane , "" not only from the set-up ( he interviews three people , and the story is a result of their flashbacks ) , but in other things , like the beginning ( death , then newsreel ) , and smaller details , like the bitter ex-friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex-wife as a washed-up lounge singer , found in a bar after hours .  this is no "" kane , "" and it really doesn't aspire to be : it doesn't attempt to be the deep outlook of something gone like "" kane "" did , and it doesn't really uncover anything poignant about humanity .  instead , it uses the flashbacks as a form of contrast between the magic that was the glam rock era and the boredom that was life after glam rock for those who were participants .  the 80s scenes are dry and deliriously melancholy , equipped with a performance by bale that is perhaps appropriately dull and unengaging .  but the 70s scenes are engaging , though , not to mention addictively campy .  they radiate with gorgeous cinematography that nicely accentuates all the vibrant colors of the era , and a feel that's so eerily lighthearted that when combined with the then-footage , they become not only a symbol of decadence , but of times when everything seemed so simple .  instead of creating the world the way it was , haynes paints their own world as if it were a narcotic fairy tale : the glam rock movement was full of so much freedom and liberation that after you've experienced it , everything else seems so mundane .  there's no outside world to speak of , secluding these people inside a protective globe that will eventually crack .  haynes focuses his story on the tale of blade and the other fictitious rock hero , curt wild , and their relationship that created , molded , and then brought down the movement , reducing everyone else who contributed to it as merely that - contributors .  blade - played with reserve by the pouty jonathan rhys meyers - and wild - played with anarchic wildness by ewan mcgregor - are little more than thinly disguised recreations of david bowie and iggy pop , respectively , complete with the creation of a ziggy stardust persona named maxwell demon and the confirmation that the two rock stars may have very well not only have been one-time partners in music , but also partners in bed .  through discussions with slade's ex-manager cecil ( michael feast ) , ex-wife mandy ( toni collette , reinventing herself as an american blonde dish who fakes a british accent when with slade ) , and finally ex-partner wild , journalist stuart begins to remember his own experiences in the era , like his discovery of his rebelliousness cum conformity , including the moment when he began questioning his own sexuality ( when he opens up his first slade record , he finds a naked and green slade lying on a crimson blanket ) , and finally running away from home to be part of the london scene , finally resulting in leading a boring job in america .  haynes demonstrates that he's quite the visual auteur , molding scenes that are like long heald breaths , such as a seemingly long sequence juxtaposing a slade/wild concert of them performing a brian eno cover , "" baby's on fire , "" with scenes from a decadent drug party ; and the film's most wow-inspiring sequence , the first concert scene of wild with his band , the ratttz , where mcgregor lets loose so much anarchic steam that his wild iggy-esuqe movements ( including stripping naked ) and screams that the film captures that perfect moment when one discovers a major talent , and another ( slade ) discovers his idle .  even the brief music videos , spoofs of bowie's , have a rare visual flair that's pure camp , and which would cause ken russell to drool .  the best sequence , though , may be the beginning , following the prelude , a sequence which acts as the middle ground for both the actual being of the movement and the post-movement era .  in it , stuart and his mates are going to the infamous slade concert where he fakes his own death , where he kills off his alter ego maxwell demon in what appears to be a real assasination , which brought about the end of the era in one swift fake bullet .  with brian eno's famous "" needle in the camel's eye "" playing in the background , the scene has a detached exhileration - the song doesn't seem to be played in quite the same way the other songs are .  it has a distance that's hard to put a finger on , and it seems to represent that all this is coming to a quick and sad ending , and when one sees slade in the dressing room before the show , docked in a silver frock with wings and blue hair , depressingly staring into the mirror , it comes off as a none-too-obvious prophecy of the finale in the beginning of the film .  this movie's not so much about plot , but more about the way it is presented , making this one of those films which is classified as being "" style over substance , "" a statement which prompts many critics to line up for attack .  however , for the most part , the engaging part of this film is not the story but rather the way in which haynes creates this world , by using his sets , costumes , cinematography , and especially the music to play as characters in his film .  the music is especially notable .  the soundtrack , which is wall to wall , consists of old school glam rock tunes by the likes of brian eno , t-rex , and roxy music , as well as covers by slade's band ( with vocals by thom yorke , and occasionally rhys meyers himself ) , and even newer music by shudder to think that sounds uncannily bowie-like .  the cast is rather impressive , but no one really walks away with the film , and no performances are extremely good .  although eddie izzard , as slade's manager ( who challenges slade's first manager to an arm-wrestling match to see who gets control of his career ) and michael feast as the first and tragic manager come off greatly , and collette and mcgregor have their moments , rhys meyers and bale are noticably sub-par , neither putting a lot of effort into their respective roles .  some of it is at fault with the actual construction of the film by haynes .  rhys meyers' brian slade remains merely a metaphor for the glam rock era , dying when he turned into a retro-garbo , resorting to a life of salinger-ism , and found in the mid-70s to be lying around , sniffing coke off the ass of a party girl .  in fact , no one in this film is really seen as a person , rather than just as a symbol or composite of a type who thrived during the era .  bale's character is an especially tough sell : bitter and depressed by flashbacks to his young adulthood , he's not an extremely personal character , and his cliched experiences ( being hounded by the record store guys for buying a record put out by a "" poof "" ) never help us communicate with him .  nevertheless , rhys meyers and mcgregor have the excuses that their characters are not really characters but rather the results of an era that has left them , and others , bitter , part of which helps the film work , since this is a major piece of eye candy .  at the prime of the movie , they at least look the role of fashionable leaders - slade with his perpetually-changing , androgonys persona , and wild with his topless and unpredictable image , which clash and fuse into an unstable union .  their story - of how slade was so influenced by wild that he adapted it into a similar who-cares attitude crossed with camp - is engaging , without the personal background .  the story of stuart , though , is a tougher sell because he's the everyman , and when you can't totally identify with the everyman , your story's in slight trouble .  as a cultural rock piece , "" velvet goldmine "" is rather good , but it is merely good .  it never totally takes off , although it has moments where it absolutely flies , but then comes back down .  it's really nothing more than a bunch of really great moments , surrounded by material that could really be much better .  the beginning is captivating but slow , the middle is fantastic , and the ending is not only shallow but worse than that , it drags ( the final half hour not only does it not bring the story to any real conclusion , it could probably stop at any point ) .  and did anyone really figure out what the mystery is that arthur unearths ?  it almost seems like there was no point in the entire investigation other than to unearth the past , which is commendable but not totally so .  still , it does what the oliver stone pic "" the doors "" didn't do right , becoming very insightful to what happened , using the visual style to hit most of the right notes of contrast between what made the era so great to those who lived during it and why after living through such an era that everything else seems half-assed ( i suppose the message is : "" live life , but after you've lived it , what else is the point when you'll be forced to live with regretful memories ? "" ) .  the really superb achievement of this film is that during its flashbacks , it successfully creates for the audience what it must have felt like to be in that era , but with the added perk of knowing the result of all that goes down .

1|krippendorf's tribe is a formula comedy .  done poorly , formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema .  however , every now and then , one emerges , like krippendorf's tribe , that actually works .  professor james krippendorf ( richard dreyfuss ) , the renowned anthropologist , is in trouble .  his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea .  however , he found . . . nothing .  his wife has recently died , and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids : shelly ( natasha lyonne ) , mickey ( gregory smith ) and edmund ( carl michael lidner ) .  tonight , he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe .  rather than break the news ( and face the consequences of misusing his funds ) , he invents a tribe : the shelmikedmu ( named after his kids ) .  however , one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu , but his research becomes a popular phenomenon .  soon , professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members .  his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over-eager colleague , veronica micelli ( jenna elfman ) , and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist , ruth allen ( lily tomlin ) .  krippendorf's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief .  no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras , or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes .  luckily , as the film builds momentum , that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by .  though there's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe , the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies .  the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable , and the comic timing required for some of the film's latter scenes is superb .  richard dreyfuss is terrific as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe .  jenna elfman's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times , but she plays the part with extreme affability .  even the kids , who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side , are endearing and humorous .  yes , the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor , but it has the best excuse of all : it's funny .  it may not go down as an all-time classic , but it certainly delivers what you expect from a comedy : plenty of laughs .  |0.35000000000000003|0.8833333333333333|0.8333333333333334|Overall, the explanations suggest that the sentiment of the text is positive, with the movie being praised for its humor, enjoyable performances, and ability to deliver laughs, even though there are some minor criticisms of formulaic comedies and lowbrow humor.
1|not since 1996's shine , which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott , has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world-class musicians .  in fact , if one were to watch these films together , it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills .  yet hilary and jackie , the sophomore effort from director anand tucker , has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale .  emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale , playing the sisters du pr ? .  both musicians from childhood , hilary ( griffiths ) is renowned flutist while jacqueline ( watson ) is easily as skilled on the cello .  the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women , both together and seperate .  their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another's , and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love .  the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance .  they contrast each other wonderfully , and while watson's portrayal of jackie du pr ? is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic , both characters are charged with emotion .  the frank cottrell boyce script , which is based on the book by hilary and piers du pr ? , brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well .  the script is also to be commended for its well-polished dual nature .  cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller ( which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne's script for mission : impossible ) and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame .  the latter parts of his script are controversial to say the least , and the rather depressing ending takes the wind out of an envigorating story .  some will leave this movie feeling disenfranchised .  nevertheless , hilary and jackie is a movie that reaches an upper echelon of contemporary cinema through solid fundamentals and is a decent watch all around .  |0.5666666666666668|0.8333333333333334|0.8000000000000002|"The overall sentiment of the text is positive, as it commends the performances, depth of the characters, and the exploration of complex relationships in the movie ""Hilary and Jackie"".

1|"luckily , some people got starship troopers .  some people knew it was supposed to be silly .  for those of you who didn't , how could you miss it ?  from the very beginning , when we see an interactive internet-like promotional video for the armed forces of the future , it should be obvious this film is to be taken lightly .  i guess without blatant one-liners and home alone style slapstick , some people just don't recognize such goofy humor .  such a dry approach to such intentionally campy humor must have left some disillusioned .  first thing to do before seeing this movie - lighten up .  meet the equivalent of "" beverly hills 90210 "" meets "" mighty morphin power rangers "" .  four close friends are now graduating high school and are ready to join the armed forces , which , in the future , means fighting for the whole galaxy and not just your country .  johnny rico ( casper van dien ) is ready to join the infantry , mostly because his girlfriend carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) has enlisted to be a pilot .  dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) has enlisted as a trooper , and it's possible she's joining merely to follow rico , whom she's always had eyes for .  if you saw these three on the street , you'd automatically start searching for the fashion designers and photographers , for never has a movie's cast looked so much like the cut-out cover of "" seventeen "" magazine .  the lone non-supermodel , carl jenkins ( played by doogie howser himself , neil patrick harris ) is the brainiac who gets into the military intelligence division , the top secret department that pretty much leaves doogie - er , carl out of the picture .   ( good call - now we can put all our drooling efforts into only the most deserving of characters ) .  right off the bat , rico becomes the star of the show , far surpassing all the other soldiers and becoming squadron leader in a short period of time .  but a horrific accident during a standard training exercise ( which follows all to closely to his breakup with carmen ) leaves rico ready to call it quits .  with his bags packed and his civilian clothes back on , johnny is ready to walk off base and catch the next flight home .  well sorry , rico suave , but there's no place like home , especially after gigantic alien insects have destroyed it .  that's right , the planet is being attacked by a colony of arachnid-like alien beings that a can of raid just isn't going to destroy .  with a sudden change of heart ( and clothes ) , rico is back in the game , following his fellow starship troopers off to fight a mean group of daddy long legs .  what starship troopers really is , is a spoof of all that it even remotely touches on - the soap opera like love affairs of high school , the love for sci-fi and thirst for gore shared by this same age group , etc . nothing is taken seriously .  it's almost as much a satire on young adults as clueless , but with its sly and futuristic approach , it's not as recognizably so .  it's a spoof so subtle that many won't recognize the spoofery .  if you deem this as sci-fi/action , you're wrong .  it's sci-fi/action/comedy , with the comedy being on the level of such cult favorites as evil dead 2 . starship troopers just may be on the road to cult status as well .  gore is a factor heavily brought up in reviews of this film , but the gore , too , is meant to be cheesy .  yes , it's graphic , but it's also brutally phony , and that's what makes it such great fun to watch .  not since the old "" mr . bill "" skits on "" saturday night live "" has torture and mutilation been such a joy to watch .  people were laughing out loud every time a body was severed in half or a head was viciously decapitated .  perhaps it brings back fond memories of the severities we inflicted upon our sisters' barbie dolls as young children .  with the actors resembling ken and barbie so closely , it's a good chance this is the case , whether we're fully aware of it or not .  starship troopers has it's slow parts , but it's truly an alternative to your typical sci-fi/action flick or lame juvenile comedy .  aside from the intentionally cheesy gore , the special effects are quite astounding .  when the spaceship passes a meteor , it's quite an awesome spectacle , visually crisp and captivating .  if you're looking for brainless fun , this is the epitome of your search .  a beautiful cast , awesome special effects , fast-paced action , campy acting , and a whole lot of gore .  this is brainless heaven .  just remember not to think .

1|"first , i am not a big fan of the x-files tv series .  i have nothing against it particularly , i just don't happen to watch it .  having said that , i can now say that i liked the x-files pretty well .  for us non-fans , there's nothing big going for it , but there are a lot of little things .  the movie opens on an ice cave in north texas in 35 , 000 b . c .  two proto-humans enter the cave and find a space alien cocooned inside .  the alien breaks free and kills one man in a struggle while the other is seemingly captured by the bloody ooze from the alien .  the movie jumps to the same cave today where a boy ( lucas black , from sling blade ) is captured by the same black ooze .  we then cut to fbi agents scully and mulder ( gillian anderson and david duchovny ) , who have been pulled off of their previous assignment ( investigations into the paranormal ) and put onto the bomb squad detail .  a caller has threatened a federal building in dallas , texas .  on a hunch , mulder checks out the building across the street , and , wouldn't you know it , he turns out to be right .  the fbi finds the bomb in time to evacuate but not in time to defuse .  five people die in the blast , and when mulder learns who the victims were , a light bulb goes on over his head .  the two agents team up to investigate , against fbi orders , the links mulder has made .  their search leads them back to the north texas cave , all across the country , and even to antarctica as they get closer and closer to "" the truth . ""  the plot , and "" the truth , "" are uninspired .  i got the feeling that what i learned was supposed to shock and amaze me .  it didn't .  the possible existence of aliens on earth has been explored so many times before in movies that one could hardly count them .  but the point of the x-files is not what the truth is , but the extent to which it has been hidden .  it's a slightly more interesting angle , but it still raises expectations about that "" truth "" too high .  if this were the whole film , i would say the movie was mediocre , perhaps even boring .  but there are other qualities that make me like this movie well enough to recommend it .  the pacing of the film was brisk enough to hold my interest .  before the audience can get tired of one location , the agents follow a hot tip to another location , and so on and so forth .  the locations are not all computer-generated sets , either .  there are some artificial settings , but the desert night of nevada , the edge of suburbia in texas , and the endless fields of snow in antarctica ( actually somewhere in north america . )  make this fantastic film feel more real .  ward russell's cinematography is very good .  the overall look is dark and ominous , appropriate to the intended tone of the film's plot .  russell is able to make something as innocuous as a cornfield look foreboding .  when the movie is set in darkness , the picture quality is still rich and detailed .  finally , and specifically , there is an incredible shot at night in which the camera crosses the tracks in front of a fast oncoming train .  i don't know if the shot is faked in any way , but it looks dangerous , and it looks great .  the movie's soundtrack is also used to convey the dark tone of the film . ( skip  to the next paragraph if you have yet to see the movie - there is a spoiler in the following sentences . ) during the opening prehistoric sequence , a howling wind dogs the soundtrack , never giving the characters or the audience an escape from the lonely terrible sound .  in one of the movie's most effective sequences , metallic doors suddenly slam open to release a cloud of buzzing bees .  the visuals of the scene are good , but what makes it so surprising and frightening is the sound .  there was no question as to who the movie's stars would be .  even so , duchovny and anderson are an interesting pair of actors and a good combination .  both are easy on the eyes and together , they have some good timing , banter , and energy .  there is a hint of chemistry between them , but it never gets in the way of their professional relationship .  they are like a couple of kids out exploring the empty lot at the end of the street .  there might be some romantic interest , but for now they're more interested in their environs than they are in each other .  no single element really makes this movie outstanding - not even the sense of paranoia that makes the tv show so popular .  but enough things were done right that the x-files is one of the more interesting summer adventures to come along .

1|"many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward .  most will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors .  but little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell .  walking out of the theater , i could see the audience's disgust . . .  one member even had to be awakened after the film ended .  don't believe the previews that you see . . .  this is definitely not a film for everyone .  this is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years .  kids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline .  the plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us .  it goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries .  think of the film city of angels .  now add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision .  both films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office .  costing around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it's money back .  but due to it's story , i doubt it will .  for everyone who thought titanic's story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well .  but don't get me wrong . . .  i hope the film does do well .  it's a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen .  i doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind .  what dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals .  the only film that surpasses it is dark city .  full of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to .  but don't do that , because you'll end up going to hell .  what dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake .  chris "" christy "" nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat .  annie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married .  annie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic .  chris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself .  they also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock ) .  but one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie .  she tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution .  chris copes with the problem by realizing they aren't around anymore , and nothing will change that .  just as annie gets her life back in order , chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim .  chris goes to heaven , or his version of heaven , rather .  guided by albert ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy .  that is , until he realizes how miserable he is without annie .  prior to heaven , he would try to comfort annie , but the more he was around , the more pain she felt .  chris decides to leave her alone .  little does he realize what will happen next .  i'm not about to say , because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story ( many critics , however , give it away ) .  certainly , chris dying is crucial to the plot , but they tell you that he dies in the previews .  story is not necessarily important for this movie to work , because it deals with the afterlife .  however , strangely , virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil .  a couple of comments here and there , but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life .   "" we're soul mates ! ""  chris exclaims .  heaven , in movies , is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white , purity , and love .  usually , it also looks like it rests among the clouds .  but what dreams may come goes a different route .  it shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before .  chris' heaven is his memories brought to life .  his thoughts can make anything real , and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven .   "" i've never seen anyone use real paint before , "" albert says .  equally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone .  instead , it's a state of being .  in one gloriously horrific scene , chris and his "" tracker "" ( max von sydow ) arrive at a sea of faces .  thousands of heads are stuck above ground , their bodies somewhere else .  mostly dead silent , some quips are made , almost as if to lighten the mood .  it's truly a frightening sequence .  production designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination .  using state of the art computer technology , worlds are created for exploration .  sometimes , some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact .  it's not necessary to be there , but we appreciate seeing it .  costume designer yvonne blake ( who also appears in the film ) has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes .  cinematographer eduardo serra , whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove , has a difficult job , as most cinematographers do working with special effects .  but serra's entire universe is a computer generated image , and he does a masterful job .  writer ron bass , adapting from the novel by richard matheson , provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot .  the story is extremely vague in its details , allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning .  and director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision .  what dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience .  your average movie goer more than likely isn't used to expressionistic techniques .  the film will also definitely draw attention from religious people , but they shouldn't take it too far .  it is , after all , just a movie .  robin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances , while his comedic roles have been suffering .  his comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff , but when is confined by a screenplay , he isn't quite as effective .  but drama is really his strong point , and you can see that here .  it's doubtful he'll get another oscar nomination , but i wouldn't really mind if he did .  the real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land .  this may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention .  it's also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination .  however , the academy doesn't like to award performances for these types of films .  cuba gooding , jr . has been better , but he's certainly not distracting .  max von sydow is underused , as are jessica brooks and josh paddock .  a treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear ( if they even recognize him ) as chris' father lost in the sea of faces .  it's not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film , considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images .  overall , it's williams and sciorra's film .  what dreams may come is rated pg-13 for thematic elements involving death , some disturbing images , language , and some partial nudity .  the film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience .  some will find the plot distracting .  some will find the visuals absolutely glorious .  and some will find both .  the only real problem with the film , that i could see , was that it slows down considerably during the midsection , just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins .  by the way , some controversy even surrounded the title , which was mistaken for a sexual term ( "" what "" becomes "" wet "" and you should understand ) .  in actuality , the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet .  just thought i should let you know .

1|"when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences .  the first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions .  the latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life .  decades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids .  yes , most of the kung fu and other "" martial arts "" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills .  but , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation .  the best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon .  made in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee's skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience .  it succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor .  lee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert .  he is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk .  interpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene .  lee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o'harra , han's brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee's sister years ago .  the island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts .  the plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) .  the main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys .  on the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive .  in the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy .  the latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee's acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence .  although two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief .  it is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top .  other actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) .  fighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre .  in many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent .  i'm not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can't avoid to appreciate the difference from today's movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end .  so , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don't like that particular genre .

 i shouldn't have .  this is a really good movie .  no , this is a great movie .  better yet , this is a phenomenal movie .  there is a reason classics are invented : to make sure that people will always have great movies to aid them in their quest for living life .  this is one of those films .  it is a "" feel-good "" movie , something people complain a little too much about .  but capra's reworking of "" a christmas carol "" is the greatest christmas movie of all time .  there , i've said it .  i have to admit , the first time i saw this , i saw it with my family , including my 11 year old kid sister .  they all loved it .  they loved george , his wife , his troubles , and the beautiful ending .  is it a little too sugar-coated ?  maybe .  no matter .  this is a film that should be watched time and time again , with families around a coffee table , and eggnog on the plate .  it is a film that just makes you feel good about life , family , and hope .  it is the perfect christmas film , flaws and all .  it is frank capra's greatest acheivement , and that really does say a lot .  for about 121 out of 129 minutes , this movie is flawless .  the rest can be excused : no film is perfectly flawless .  i can't get over how much i love this movie , and how much you will , after watching it , digesting it , and sitting with your family , appreciating how special life really is .

1|"of circumcision , psychic wounds and the family sitcom  the opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film .  there's a guy's voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like , and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women .  as his imagination plays o n , he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix-and-match shuffle of unlikely marriages , businesswomen with bums , matrons with paint salesmen , the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy .  it's not just a witty , funny summing up of the film 's themes - you might not guess it yet , but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on .  what starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction , gets taken on a road trip , put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash .  that may not sound so different from the average family sitcom , and the general idea of the film doesn't , at first , seem so wildly distant from standard-issue hollywood comedy : man who was adopted as a child ( ben still er ) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents , along with his wife ( patricia arquette ) , his baby , and a pretty psychology-researcher ( tea leoni ) in tow .  various mix-ups , shenanigans , oddball characters and , yup , disasters follow .  but if you think you've been here before , the dialogue and the direction ( by david o . russell , who made spanking the monkey ) take it into another dimension .  the dreaded t-name seems an inevitable reference point ( what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance ) but really the point is that the foot-massage master hasn't got a monopoly on plot twists and fast , funny , irreverent lines , or on the absurdities of ordinary speech .  whether it's about circumcision , psychic wounds , oral sex , carjacking , the beauties of the armpit area , or ronald reagan , the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention .  the best thing is how these words aren't just there for the punchlines , but are great precisely because they're said in character , like tea leoni's neurotically-charged psychobabbler who's able to say under assault , "" it's understandable if you find this threatening "" .  the cast is excellent throughout , and , rather than singling out anybody , kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting , with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission .  there are some elements of a woody allen film in this ( not to mention the hand-held camera and loose , improvisational feel of some scenes ) .  like allen , russell's interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children ( and everybody , really ) .  still , if you're expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la "" murphy brown "" / "" frasier "" / fill-in-the-blank-american-comedy , well , it won't happen .  the film sets up expectations like these , with the lead character's search f or his origins and his hopes of self-healing , only to knock them down .  if the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one-ness , flirting with disaster's charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go .  and that , the film suggests , is the essential family state - and you better learn to love it .  somehow , this is perversely feelgood cinema , right up to its manic end .

1|"nosferatu the vampyre ( germany 1979 )  a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 mike watson  this extraordinary re-telling of bram stoker's "" dracula "" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore .  inspired by f . w . murnau's 1922 silent film of the same name , herzog's film is a work of exquisite bleakness , an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards .  the original full-length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u . s . distributor anchor bay entertainment , and in gorgeous widescreen prints .  until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video , and only in europe .  both of these re-releases restore the film to its full length , but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue .  apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent , and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed .  the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one .  everyone knows the story of dracula .  or do they ?  his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly won't hurt .  jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count ( played by klaus kinski ) who wants to buy a house in harker's hometown .  upon seeing a photo of harker's wife ( the radiant isabelle adjani ) he instantly falls in love with her .  locking harker up in his castle , he sets off on a long journey to meet this woman whose beauty so bewitches him .  upon divining his identity as a vampire , adjani seduces the count and lures him to his death one morning as the sun rises .  that is a story familiar to millions , but herzog has elevated stoker's tale into the realm of - and i use this term a tad reluctantly - cinematic art .  nosferatu is as much a meditation as it is a film , shot through blue-ish and white filters and peopled with characters who perform as if they were half hypnotised .  the film's surreal , dream-like quality is utterly mesmerising .  there is much to enjoy , but i'll limit my praise to a few key points .  holding the film together is kinski's remarkable performance as count dracula .  past screen portrayals , including bela lugosi's famous turn , have largely been one dimensional and tended towards camp .  but kinski . . . oh boy , this is something far more compelling .  aided by a startling make-up job , he portrays dracula's vampirism not simply as pure evil but as some sort of loathsome disease .  this man is dreadfully lonely .  he lives in utter solitude , shunned by the locals for his hideous appearance and reputation for bloodlust .  kinski's portrayal of the count is both creepy and deeply affecting .  when he dies , you almost feel as if this man's tortured soul has been freed at last .  then there's the unforgettable soundtrack , largely composed by german group popul vuh .  it is so eerily beautiful and evocative that it's quite impossible to imagine the film without it .  popul vuh are longtime herzog collaborators and play an ancient-sounding kind of spacemusic using piano , chants , and exotic instruments .  when i first saw this film some years ago i was so impressed i tracked down and bought a number of their albums .  the one i still listen to the most is "" tantric songs "" , from which most of the music in nosferatu is taken .  it's a testament to the music's depth that it is as powerful without the pictures as it is with them .  the album is still available on the highly respected ambient and world music label celestial harmonies .  this is a timely re-release by anchor bay .  after francis ford coppola's unscary and woefully overblown version of bram stoker's tale in 1992 , it is a joy to go back to herzog's film and see the amazing things he has done with what is now a century-old story .  to some aficionados , nosferatu is quite simply the greatest vampire film ever made .  without a doubt , it is an unmistakable classic of the genre .  don't miss it .

1|even if i did not know that director and co-writers james wong and jeffrey reddick of the creepy final destination helped create the hit television show the x-files , i would have inevitably made a connection .  the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot , to the mysterious characters , to the overall dark , ominous settings .  it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case , they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis ( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie ) .  another more important similarity , is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time .  this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie , especially when compared to some of the trash , of the same genre , released in the last couple of years ( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch ) .  what helps final destination is its unique premise .  unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders , the villain presented is unusual , it's the grim reaper .  this being already has predestined when and how you will die .  according to the brief history lesson given in this film , everyone was meant to die at a certain time , some people at 100 , others at 17 , whatever death chooses .  what is unique about death is that it's already dead , so you can't really kill it .  the only way to defeat death is to cheat it ; the question is how do you do that ?  this dilemma is what faces alex and a group of teenagers .  alex has been having some dreams that the airplane which will take his class on a trip to paris will crash , leaving no survivors .  alex begins to realize that his dreams are a little too real and eventually gets himself and six others kicked off the plane right before it takes off .  shortly after , the plane does indeed crash leaving some of the seven survivors confused and others feeling immortal .  however , death isn't through with them yet .  it gradually kills off the seven one by one , leaving those currently still alive frantically trying to trick death again .  the plot allows for some of the most creative , original death scenes i have seen in a while .  some scenes build up the perfect amount of tension until an elaborate climax , others are so unexpected they will leave your jaw wide open in shock .  creativity and originality are two adjectives lacking in most horror films nowadays but final destination is not like most horror films .  sure , it has your traditional share of jerks and outsiders ( ali larter's character is particularly annoying ) , but the shocks , from the beginning to the end , are extremely entertaining .  also director wong has the sense not to take the movie too seriously .  he knows its just another entertaining guilty pleasure that won't win any academy awards ( not even a golden globe ) .  the myriad of inside jokes and gags ( the characters are named after famous horror directors , one character who plays a jerk is named carter , like x-files creator chris carter , and a song by john denver , who died in a plane crash , plays whenever death is near ) show this movie is a bunch of guys having a good time making a movie .  and from this , i had a great time watching the movie .  |0.6643333333333333|0.8306666666666667|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment is positive, as the text praises the similarities between The X-Files and Final Destination, the entertainment value and originality of the plot, the thrilling and unique premise, and the director's sense of humor and inclusion of inside jokes.
