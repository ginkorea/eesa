0|the scene at the end of 1989's `dead poets society , ' when robin williams' english students stand up on their desk and say , `captain , my captain , ' gets me every time .  unfortunately , the court room scene near the end of robin's newest film , `patch adams , ' doesn't have anywhere near the same impact .  from the surface `patch adams' looks very promising .  it's a story about a not so young man , patch adams ( robin williams ) , who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people .  when the film opens , we find patch , depressed and suicidal , checking himself into a mental hospital .  in a few scenes , strongly reminiscent of `one flew over the cuckoo's nest , ' he ends up helping the patients through their problems ; and it's here that he finds how much he loves working with people .  so he checks himself out of the hospital , and heads straight to medical school .  right from the start , patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable .  he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry .  shortly after joining medical school , he meets and falls in love with carin ( monica potter ) .  they , along with patch's dork friend , truman ( daniel london ) , start a medical clinic for uninsured people .  once the dean catches wind of the clinic , he tells patch he can't graduate and kicks him out of school .  patch , like what any true american would do , takes the school to court .  it's here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place , over whether or not patch can become a real doctor .  i have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it .  it seems more like a series of short sketches , rather than a full-length movie .  considering it runs almost two hours , much too long for such a light film , it could have flowed much smoother .  not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself , and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama .  robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels .  but those moments are rare and in the end `patch adams' is barely average .  |-0.13333333333333333|0.7666666666666666|0.8666666666666667|"The overall sentiment is slightly negative, as the user expresses disappointment with the court room scene in ""Patch Adams"" and criticizes the film for being average.

0|the real blonde ( r ) a woman's face , an arm , some pumped-up pectorals , blond hair , a man's sad face , slender legs , a random hand here and there .  as the opening credits of tom dicillo's the real blonde unfold , these scattered , fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini brief-clad man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman , his head concealing her unclothed breasts .  if only the rest of this formless , aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently .  joe ( matthew modine ) is a waiter/struggling actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas .  he's feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live-in love , mary ( catherine keener ) , who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender .  mary , a makeup artist , regularly works on model sahara ( bridgette wilson ) , who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disney's the little mermaid .  the bottle blonde has a turbulent on-again , off-again relationship with bob ( maxwell caulfield ) , a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde , which he finds in co-star kelly ( daryl hannah ) .  as the film unspools , a variety of other characters pass through : fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) ; mary's shrink ( buck henry ) and self-defense instructor ( denis leary ) ; joe's casting agent ( kathleen turner ) and hardass boss ( christopher lloyd ) ; and a mystery woman ( elizabeth berkley ) who keeps on crossing joe's path .  where exactly does all this go ?  that's a question best posed to writer-director dicillo , who doesn't appear to have the slightest clue himself .  his meandering , largely unfunny script and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers , turning into dead-end narrative streets only to reverse course and hit another creative cul-de-sac .  and another .  and another .  at one point bob , frustrated with the soap scripts , complains to the head writer ( jim fyfe ) that his and kelly's characters keep on going in circles , with no hint of development or growth .  that is most certainly the case here .  joe gets a job and ultimately botches things ; he and mary bicker ; they make up , only to have the pattern repeat itself .  unhappy with his bottle blonde , bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied ; he returns to the faux and is still unsatisfied .  if there is a point to all of this , dicillo dances around it , spending his time on apparent digressions that , as it turns out , aren't digressions at all .  the real blonde is not without some amusements .  it does have the occasional funny line and situation ; leary , henry , lloyd , steve buscemi , and dave chappelle shine in their small roles ; keener is a likable , refreshingly earthy lead ; berkley's appearance is mercifully brief ( she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a ten-minute role ) ; and there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket ( last year , the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six months--due to lack of viewer interest ) .  but on the whole , the real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title--it may be glossy on the surface , but there's nothing going on inside .

0|" "" jack frost , "" is one of those dumb , corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film , but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching .  this does not come as a surprise , since the studio that made it is warner brothers , who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other .  jack frost ( michael keaton ) is a struggling middle-aged rock musician who loves his wife , gabby ( kelly preston ) , and 11-year-old son , charlie ( joseph cross ) , but doesn't spend nearly enough time with them .  when he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play , he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas .  halfway there , jack has second thoughts , but on his way back home , is in a car accident and dies .  switch forward a year , christmas is approaching once again , and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jack's death .  when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died , the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack's spirit .  jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him , but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise .   "" frosty the snowman , "" is a classic cartoon , and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated , but as a live-action film , it doesn't work at all .  after a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established , "" jack frost , "" quickly goes downhill , especially once the snowman comes into play .  since jack has been deceased for a whole year , you would think there would be many questions to ask him , such as , "" what happens after you die ? ""  or , "" how does it feel to be a snowman ? ""  but instead , the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie .  the performances are respectable enough , but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this .  michael keaton at least got off easy , since he disappears after the first twenty minutes , but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here ?  i have always liked kelly preston .  she is clearly a talented , charismatic actress , but has never been given a good role in her life , usually having to settle for a one-dimensional supporting character , as in , 1997's , "" nothing to lose , "" and , "" addicted to love . ""  joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast , since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent .  in one of the only subplots that actually works , due to its wittiness , henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman .  this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side , however , by the tried-and-true main plot at hand , which is the sappy story of a father and son .  since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around , i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid , cringe-inducing lines of dialogue .  some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father : "" you da man , "" says charlie .   "" no , i da snowman , "" replies jack .  or how about this little zinger , coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out : "" snowdad is better than no dad . ""  do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this ?  the snowman , created by john henson's creature shop , is more believable than the snowman from last year's unintentionally hilarious direct-to-video horror flick , also called , "" jack frost , "" but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects .  either way , it was an awful lot of work to go through , just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project .  as a seasonal holiday picture , "" jack frost , "" is pretty much a clunker .  a better christmas film from this year is , "" i'll be home for christmas . ""  better yet , my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film , such as , "" it's a wonderful life , "" "" a christmas story , "" or , "" prancer . ""   "" jack frost , "" is an earnest , but severely misguided film , and children , as well as adults , deserve better .  i doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent , anyway .

0|some movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch .  then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone * in * the movie has turned off * their * brains .  the real mccoy is both .  it's charmless , molasses-slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta , where the real mccoy is set , might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation .  the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) being arrested in the middle of a job .  six years later , karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight .  she soon bumps into j . t . barker ( val kilmer ) , a hapless would-be thief who idolizes karen .  j . t . also has ties to jack schmidt ( terence stamp ) , the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him .  schmidt , who is in cahoots with karen's sleazy parole officer ( gailard sartain ) , again wants karen to help him stage a robbery .  this time he has some leverage : karen's kidnapped son .  just when she thought she was out , they keep pulling her back * in . *  contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them .  leading the list is the jack schmidt character , who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins .  there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime , let alone why he would actually participate in the break-in .  karen's initial encounter with j . t . during a botched convenience store hold-up also strains the limits of credibility .  it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point , but instead they run into each other the next day because they're leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment .  small world , eh ?  then there's the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape , and pet tigers which , through the power of the laws of bad cinema , must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage .  however , the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police , who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day .  but the fun doesn't end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne .  there is also the absence of a single , solitary interesting character .  karen is earnest and single-minded in her motherly devotion , but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal , and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material .  schmidt is a flaccid villain , the parole officer is a complete blank , and karen's son and ex-husband might as well be furniture .  only kilmer's j . t . is remotely appealing , but his one potentially intriguing quality , his ineptitude , is never developed .  in fact , kilmer disappears during the middle of the film , just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub-plot .  i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy , but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast .  various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever , and some end with no reason evident why they didn't end up on the cutting room floor .  even the reasonably clever climactic break-in falls victim to this syndrome , including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts ( i kid you not ) four minutes .  there is no tension in the scene , just tedium .  russell mulcahy ( highlander ) is a director with some style , and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good , but he completely stumbles in the editing room .  there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that i'm tempted to overlook the little ones .  like karen disarming one of schmidt's henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing .  like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later .  tempted . but i'm pretty good at resisting temptation .  |-0.9|0.8666666666666667|0.7666666666666666|The text has an overwhelmingly negative sentiment towards the movie, with the reviewer criticizing its lack of charm, slow pacing, stupid characters, contrived plotlines, uninteresting characters, and poor editing.
0|"you think that these people only exist in the movies , but trust me , they're as real as life .  i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual person's brain with microwaves .  then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections .  i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted .  these people had what are known as "" conspiracy theories "" - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public .  a little imagination goes a long way .  in richard donner's conspiracy theory , jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything .  his latest , that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle , might sound outrageous to us , but is all in a day's work for him .  he combs the newspaper , looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes , and from there jerry draws his conclusions .  upstanding citizen that he is , he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned .  lucky gal , alice , who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since .  what she doesn't know is that jerry's interest in her is far more than , well , professional .  he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment .  but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerry's ideas and his limited-circulation "" conspiracy theory "" newsletter , he finds himself in danger and in real need of alice's help .  one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action , nor a significant number of thrills .  part of this is a result of the film's slow pace .  it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice , and even once that is over with , the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement .  at over two hours , this film could have been significantly condensed and had it's running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour , but even then , the action scenes would not be able to save the film .  instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces , we're treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite "" black elements "" : black helicopter , men in black action suits and body armor , black vehicles - you know the drill .  they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons , but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time .  big deal , we've seen it all before .  watching the film , i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination , but i was out of luck .  now , when i say it took forever to set up the "" relationship "" between jerry and alice , i completely mean what one person is relative to the other , and not romantic involvement .  oh , donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie , the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other , but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring .  you see , there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory .  the two just don't click , and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out he's been stalking her ) , the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced .  the script in general also seems forced , like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it , then took it and forced it upon us .  dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable , to the point that i almost stopped listening .  even gibson's usual gift for ad lib couldn't punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest , although one of jerry's theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing .  unfortunately , much of what's discussed in the film is not inherently important to what's going on , but instead filler that starts out with potential , but ends up just being extraneous because it's never followed through .  for example , jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station .  he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station ) , and that the coroner should check the man's lungs for chlorine .  this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him .  you know what happens then ?  nothing , zip , nada .  no follow-up whatsoever , so what's the significance ?  okay , here's another one .  a couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel "" the catcher in the rye "" .  jerry also has a bunch of copies .  whenever he goes into a bookstore , he has to buy one .  leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin , we're never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin .  not when we find out about his salinger collection , not when he goes to the bookstore , not later on when we get the answer to our first question .  the point becomes totally extraneous .  oh , did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ?  yeah , he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy .  that's about it .  for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has , he's nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory .  you can just lump him in with the supporting players , with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi .  this guy was really likable , and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time .  okay , here's my theory .  this really started out as a great film , but some of its jokes were actually true !  the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security , and this was what was left over .

0|my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies .  we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills , the corny dialog , the ludicrous premises and the bad acting .  since other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment , we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together .  i can't remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along .  he was not amused .  i on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained .  perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity .  i on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing : insulting my intelligence , and brought adequate movie-making skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made , at least in terms of the craft .  the movie could have been better if it were not so brusque .  this movie slaps you with conception , pregnancy , delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames , without pausing for infancy .  the producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a woman's womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm , and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an inside-out cesarean .  an autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone , to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect .  in a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp ; it is used only after the skull has been exposed .  the opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good .  the writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle : `as bad as it gets' .  as the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck .  eve ( natasha henstridge ) was cloned from sil , the original alien sexual predator , but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated , which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner .  in a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer ( marg helgenberger ) : `i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet . '  it's enough to melt the most callous heart .  at another point she protests : `i'm human too , you know . '  she is only half right .  peter medak , the director , knows his business .  justin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials .  james cromwell , his father , is perfect in a short role .  marg heldenberger , the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful .  natasha is an exquisite ornament .  george dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up .  michael madsen was there .  black buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits , which is more that we can say for lazard . .  |-0.06666666666666667|0.7333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|"The author has a mixed sentiment towards bad movies, with a slightly negative sentiment due to the mention of flaws, but also appreciates their entertainment value and the performances of certain actors.

0|"it seemed like the perfect concept .  what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ?  it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh .  jim carrey's signed on too ?  even better .  the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth .  such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy .  yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny .  it's not for lack of trying .  the farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them .  this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult .  soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster .  this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street .  then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks .  some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work .  they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's "" there's something about mary . ""   ( 1999's "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project . )  the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected .  in "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion .   "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work .  having been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment .  the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes .  but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of "" me , myself & irene "" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy .  the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go .   ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ?  yeah , me too . )  the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be .  compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross .  the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry .  take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) .  the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face .  but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either .  that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through .   "" me , myself & irene "" reeks of wasted opportunities .  there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions .  this doesn't really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it .  the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , "" whitey "" ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax .  jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in "" all of me .

0|"wesley snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles .  murder at 1600 , u . s . marshals , money train , drop zone , boiling point , and the ultimate camp film - passenger 57 .  the art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category .  ultimately , it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report , ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe , and terrible acting by b-list actors like michael biehn and anne archer .  oddly , it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes "" masterpiece , "" rising sun .  the movie revolves around the convenient story of a special un operative caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador , the chinese triad brotherhood , a rich chinese businessman ( played by ? that bad guy from rising sun , cary-hiroyuki tagawa ) a chinese un interpreter , and , inexplicably , donald sutherland .  the film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island .  or should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woo's hong kong films combined .  i am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film .  i usually enjoy snipes' movies - though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films .  simply , i am amazed by the how inane the script was , filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences .  director christian duguay ( screamers ) has a strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts -- showing splattering brains , people impaled with broken shards of glass , and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere .  it also sickens me to know that oliver stone , one of the greatest directors working today , had his hand in producing this monstrosity .  i guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle and stone chose not to read the script , watch the dailies , be involved in casting , or anything else -- or else he'd be filing a court order to remove his name from the credits .  it's also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies and the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese .  i'm sure over the next couple of months , even more "" chinese conspiracy/martial-arts action flicks "" are going to be popping up in your local multiplex .  hopefully they won't include wesley snipes .

0|"senseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one-joke concept a bit too far .  director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this , having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies .  marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon , a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage .  however , he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition , scott thorpe ( david spade , in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep ) : an athletic record , sponsorship by a fraternity , and , most of all , a wealthy family to back him up .  in fact , darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet .  but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel .  he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the university's dr . wheedon ( brad dourif ) .  as a result , his senses are magnified tenfold .  using his newfound abilities , he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job ( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side-effects to having super senses ) .  naturally , marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle , giving jim carrey-ish amounts of physical humor .  the problem is , aside from a few genuinely inspired bits , there's not much that's funny here .  the film has it's one central gag , and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor .  there obviously wasn't much thought put into the plot .  the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous .  i mean , why the emphasis on extra-curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single-elimination quiz anyhow ?  and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester ?  to give it credit , senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryl's roommate , tim laflour ( matthew lillard ) .  apparently , he is supposed to be faddish , but the film never does anything with him , leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie .  his "" intervention "" scenes with darryl , however , do provide a rare , and welcome , laugh .  and then there's the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one .  in this case , the object of darryl's amor is janice ( tamara taylor ) , a fellow student who won't have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super-senses .  needless to say , the romance is completely extraneous , and adds little to the film .  this is a film that desperately needed something else .  be that a good plot , more jokes ( or simply funnier ones ) , or a strong character or two , anything would have helped senseless get off the ground .  as it is , all the manic exuberant mugging in the world can't help marlon wayans get this one off the ground .

0|"i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor , an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy .  it's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity , but there it was nonetheless .  i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 .  in a word , it's the same thing that's wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing .  more to the point , it's the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you're telling a story about a relationship .  the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we're expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive , pleasant people just because they're attractive and pleasant .  in this particular case , attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris o'donnell ) , a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage .  it's a scary notion for jimmy , even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger ) , his girlfriend of three years .  convinced despite his reservations that it's time to "" sh * t or get off the pot , "" jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly .  anne refuses , which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will .  jimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p . m . on his 30th birthday , stays married for 10 years and produces a child .  there are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmy's 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found , meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex-girlfriends .  it's a wacky , brewster's millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the film's better , more self-aware lines of dialogue ) , the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters .  at least that would be the case if jimmy weren't already a world-class altruist .  screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesn't get married , not only will he lose all the money , but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him , costing hudreds of jobs .  from the outset , jimmy's motivation isn't cash ; it's the livelihoods of his devoted employees .  it's almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelor's plot development .  by any human standard , the guy is impossibly selfless .  and that's the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness .  there's never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers , because there's no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake .  the blandly nice o'donnell couldn't pull off a randy cad if he tried , so the filmmakers don't even let him ; zellweger's anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to , but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged .  and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation .  the parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny , since they're all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion .  i'll admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing , including ustinov's rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks .  far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly , like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church .  you're never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor , but that's not the real problem .  nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion it's leading up to .  the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- there's no spark , no energy , no humanity .  it's an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumer's digestions .  we've reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment don't even have a pulse .  the bachelor is love among the mannequins .

0|"what hath kevin williamson wrought ?  while the horror movie revival spurred on by his _scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the genre--_i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_ , _halloween : _h20_ , and _scream_2_ --it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films .  those williamson-less post-_scream_ efforts , among them _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_ , have been frightening all right--frighteningly , insultingly _bad_ .  add to that list _urban_legend_ , which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy .  the influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas .  first , the opening sequence , like that of _scream_ , is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling .  this sequence , in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini ( natasha gregson wagner ) is decapitated while driving , also reveals the other obviously williamson-esque touch : the killer's look .  dressed in a large hooded parka , wielding an axe , the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the _i_know . . . _fisherman ,  sans the hook .  one thing horta does not borrow from williamson , however , is the intriguing premise .  students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends--those contemporary bits of "" mythology "" passed from person to person , group to group , year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness .  it hardly matters if they are true or not , such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi ( he didn't ) .  michelle , slain by the "" killer lurking in the backseat "" of lore , is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true ; as the body count rises , fellow pendleton student natalie ( alicia witt ) suspects not only a link between the murders , but a personal link to her past as well .  the setup shows promise , but the story never takes off , due in large part to horta and the director , the aptly named jamie blanks , who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares .  too many of the would-be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues , and the film's chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _scream_ tried to subvert , like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should--and could--run out the front door .  but that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches ; there's also the climactic villain confession , in which a contrived and way-too-convenient motive is revealed , not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick , which is a cliche in any film genre .  banks and horta's ( intentional ) attempts at humor are also lame ; the fact that the best gags are lazy , in-jokey references to the other credits of co-stars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor .  some laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed , but i'm not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so .  the filmmakers don't get much help from their onscreen talent .  i was far from a fan of bland _i_know . . . _  starlet jennifer love hewitt , but i'd talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt , whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter ; witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesence-challenged leading man , jared leto .  _dawson's_creek_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo ; gayheart displays all the depth and range of , well , a noxzema spokeswoman ; and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor .  granted , the cast is hampered by their material .  loretta devine , who has done some fine work in films such as _waiting_to_exhale_ , is saddled with the ridiculous role of a pam grier-worshiping campus security guard .  the recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one man--namely , kevin williamson--to stay alive .  if other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as _urban_legend_ , the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers' many victims .

0|"when a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart , it could mean one of two things : that the recently overworked individual is due for a well-deserved rest , or that either of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the timing is merely a coincidence .  the latter's the case with john mctiernan and "" the thirteenth warrior , "" which finally hits theatres a year and counting after its original spring '98 opening - and fast on the heels of mctiernan's "" the thomas crown affair "" remake , a flick that got good reviews .  you don't have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that "" thirteenth "" won't be so lucky .  reportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton , whose "" eaters of the dead "" novel provides "" warrior "" 's source ( and its initial title ) , this messy melange of culture-clash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish - sorta like "" braveheart "" without any of the passion .  but the bloodshed certainly remains : there's enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills , though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness .  these circa-10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside .  the good guys are loud , crude , often unintelligible and - judging from their highly icky hygiene habits -- pretty smelly to boot , which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador ( antonio banderas ) who tags along quite reluctantly .  they're also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises .  you'll wince , you'll groan , you'll grouse , "" haven't we seen this guy killed twice before ? ""  banderas stands confused amidst the chaos , partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animal-skin fashion run amok .  he's not the hero - his soulful eyes and lean build don't exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions - and "" the thirteenth warrior "" wisely doesn't pretend he is , allowing his foreign and physically imposing co-stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough .  let the characters interaction sans swords and shields , however , and there's still a struggle - for the audience to follow or even care about the story .  it isn't the end until audiences have witnessed a half-baked romance , murky political intrigue , veteran actor omar sharif ( "" funny girl "" ) dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic "" indiana jones and the temple of doom "" -esque chase through the villains' underground lair .  all this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr . , but the collaboration between "" die hard "" -helmer mctiernan and "" jurrasic park "" -creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights , graphic action and unintentionally telling moments .  heard during "" the thirteenth warrior "" 's final scene : a dog whimpering .  how appropriate .

0|" "" the red violin "" is a cold , sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached .  it's a movie that seems almost clinical , as it traces the 300-plus-years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title .  opening in the 17th century , the story shows how violin-maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son .  but when tragedy strikes , the violin becomes the personification of its maker's grief .  from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery .  again , tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph .  we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in mao's communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz ( samuel l . jackson ) , who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity .  the violin becomes morritz's obsession , just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it .  morritz , however , is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator's intention .   "" the red violin "" could have been a touching , inspirational story , as soaring as a beethoven symphony .  however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer .  here is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact .  girard , for some unknown reason , uses mostly master shots , keeping his camera - and thus us - at a distance .  we get no feel for the miracle that is the violin .  it's resonance , its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression .  nor are any of the performances memorable .  it's as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin .

0|"there have been merchant-ivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than "" the mod squad , "" a self-consciously "" hip "" cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby-boomers .  well , said "" squad "" certainly won't be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else , maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards .  a contemporary take on this decidedly '70s show doesn't exactly seem unwarranted , but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didn't transform into a full-blown case of botulism .  how curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad , insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time .  they are julie , pete and linc , reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd ( exposition put out of the way so fast that you're likely to be lost from the opening moments on ) , and they are respectively played by claire danes , giovanni ribisi and omar epps , talented actors each deserving of better than this .  their plight involves standard cop-corruption stuff , as our would-be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover-up after their superior ( reliable dennis farina , one of the best things here and gone so quickly ) gets killed and framed for drug trafficking .  they pout a lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others .  when you're supposed to be asking , "" what's going to happen next ?

0|"ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film .  it's more of a show , a big commercial for ted turner's world championship wrestling ( wcw ) .  the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page , goldberg , and sting .  the story is very minimal and basic .  there are these two guys , gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) .  they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming .  when they go to a live event for the big match up , there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano ) .  gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus' plans .  on the way , they meet some people , have some fun , and clean up some port-o-potties .  sounds great huh , well it's not .  the movie makes many attempts at humor , only a few of them work .  the jokes that make you laugh , however , do not outnumber the film's many duds .  there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa .  the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back .  i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquette's tag team partner is 'macho man' randy savage .  they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor .  the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan .  mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl , the cheerleaders of the wcw .  she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice , funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowan's breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face .  now what didn't work in this movie ?  that would be the rest of it .  the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets .  the two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck , the excrements spill all over the road .  it's not funny ; it's pathetic and brainless .  the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way .  i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie .  the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle , like that would happen to any fan , especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set .  also , i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in .  i like wrestling .  i watch it at home and laugh .  it's continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldn't watch it .  this movie wasn't even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv .  the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew .  the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently .  the movie was too dim-witted to be funny .  it is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever .  a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film , detroit rock city .  that movie was interesting , well done and continuously funny unlike this film .  the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh .  now that the scream trilogy is over , arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads .  at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox .  he's in the funny parts of the film but there aren't enough to make him look good .  the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rock's "" bawitdaba "" and "" cowboy "" .  martin landau has a great cameo as a classic , hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne .  script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin .  a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it .  at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real .  the wrestlers form alliances , go to people's houses and beat them up .  it's utterly ridiculous .  the whole film was a wasteful , dumfounding experience .  the movie was made to pay homage to the fans , telling them things that made wrestling , not the wrestlers .  the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty-humor movie .  the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two-hour commercial to watch it .  if you're going to watch wrestling watch wwf , it's actually entertaining .  the wrestling is betters , they're funnier , more diverse , and have better entrance themes .  oh and the girls are hotter .  is this what movies have become , 2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see ?  don't waste your money .
