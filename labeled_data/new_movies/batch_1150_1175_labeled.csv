0|"jean-claude van damme movies tend to be , if nothing else , a lot of mindless fun .  his latest film , "" knock off , "" skips on the fun part leaving a wildly incoherent exercise that is , well , simply mindless .  you can't really blame van damme .  no one , i suspect , has ever expected "" the muscles from brussels "" to contribute a heartfelt performance brimming with introspection and delicate shades of gray .  and even his sidekick co-star , "" saturday night live "" alumnus rob "" makin' copies "" schneider , does what's expected of him , although neither appear to want the role of straight man .  no , the problem with the film is its direction .  the first five minutes of the film are incomprehensible . . .  and it goes downhill from there !  five hundred characters , it seems , are introduced within the first fifteen minutes .  van damme doesn't land his first kick until after thirty--too late for most action fans--and by the time the hour mark has rolled around , your jaw will be on your cup holder and you'll be wondering why you elected to spend seven dollars on this mess .  director hark tsui , whose previous film was the van damme/dennis rodman teamed "" double team , "" films at such a frenetic pace that it's hard to know what's going on , who's on whose side , and what the point of all this is .  faster than you can yell "" fruit stand !

""  the fact that the film is staged during hong kong's last days under british rule gets some lip service but doesn't figure in at all .  perhaps "" knock off "" 's most intriguing credit is that ron and russell mael composed the frenzied music score .  some of you might remember the mael brothers as the '80s synth pop duo sparks ; their contributions here are as confused as the accompanying action-- "" kimono my house "" indeed !  like the cheap jeans and "" pumma "" sneakers manufactured in hong kong , van damme's latest is a real phony .

"" twilight "" wants very much to be a 1940's film noir with alan ladd or dick powell .  all of the standard tropes are here : a hard-boiled p . i .  among the rich and beautiful whose glamour hides sinister secrets , a femme fatale who tempts and confounds the hero , shadowy figures shooting from doorways , dead bodies confronting the hero at every turn , cops dogging his path and interfering with his investigation .  the script offers little originality , and co-authors benton and richard russo seem unaware that what was original in 1948 is a clich ? in 1998 .  elmer bernstein's score is hauntingly melodic and could have been drawn note-for-note from a vintage noir .  the lead actors try hard-none of the three has every made less than a full effort , even when burdened with a bad script .  they try to invest every line and gesture with meaning , and they create a convincing sense of the relationships between the main characters .  harry is fond of jack but is in love with catherine .  jack is dying of cancer and is jealous of harry's love for catherine .  catherine teases harry and enjoys his attention , but her real feelings are hidden beneath a carefully-maintained veneer .

0|"there was probably a good reason that the warner bros . studio chose not to allow critics to view this steven seagal film when it first opened .  and , after seeing this piece of toxic waste , i now know why .  this movie is by far the worst offering that has hit the screen since possibly those ernest movies years ago .  fire down below centers its story on a little mining town in god's country , somewhere in eastern kentucky .  it's beauty and natural goodness is being slowly destroyed by an uncaring mining magnate ( kris kristopherson , who constantly looks like he wants to kill his agent for getting him this role ) .  it turns out that he's filling the mines throughout kentucky with toxic waste for a tidy profit .  seagal plays jack taggert , an aikido-versed , fighting machine , who is an agent with the epa .  no . . . not the cia nor the fbi nor the nsa .  it's the environmental protection agency .  i had no idea that epa agents were trained to be killers !  taggert is sent to find the perpetrators and to bring them to justice .  written by someone named jeb , i could already envision the stereotypes of incestuous relationships , banjo-picking preachers , and dumb-as-nails rednecks .  but the script puts seagal right smack dab in the middle of all of these scenarios as he tries to discreetly fit in .  seagal's idea of a disguise is a long-length $1000 leather jacket .  but to get closer to the kinfolk , he will fix people's porches for free .  that's another great epa asset - teaching agents how to fix porches .  slow and plodding , this project is a total mess .  the sometimes allure of watching seagal is watching him outmaneuver enemies that outnumber and outgun him like in under seige .  here , his bravado basically turns into bullyness .  townsfolk who are foolish enough to challenge seagal are quickly subdued .  fight scenes are quick and senseless and offers no enjoyment value whatsoever .  and his soap box message wears thin within the first 15 minutes .  the most annoying moment comes when he barges into the middle of a sunday church ceremony , gets behind the pulpit , and beseeches the townsfolk to take control of their lives and to help clean up the environment .  but the epitome of how moralistically mushy this film gets happens when the person responsible for the toxic dumping , kristopherson , meets up with seagal .  kristopherson asks seagal how much it will take for him to go away .  seagal gallantly replies : "" i'll leave when you take the poison from the streams and the earth . ""  i was expecting patriotic music to start blasting and a show of fireworks in the background .  this is truly nothing more than a pompous showcase for seagal's righteousness and narcissistic arrogance .  seagal has been vanguard in trying to bring a new genre into the filmplace , that of the enviro-thriller ( on deadly ground ) .  however , the message will never come across through poorly developed vehicles like this .  still , i believe in preserving mother earth , so save your $5 and please donate it instead to some worthy environmentally conscious charity .

0|"tom dicillo directs this superficial comedy about superficial people in superficial careers , all searching for deeper meaning .  however , they won't find much meaning in the real blonde , and not enough real humor , either .  joe ( matthew modine ) is a struggling actor , or he claims to be one , even though he has no credits under his belt .  his girlfriend , mary ( catherine keener ) has no pretensions about her career : she's a makeup artist , working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) and supermodel of the month , sahara ( bridgette wilson ) .  sahara , who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid , has an on-again , off-again relationship with joe's best friend , bob ( maxwell caulfield ) .  however , bob has gotten his biggest break yet : a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly ( daryl hannah ) , who may be that illusive woman he's always pursued : a real blonde .  there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde , but not enough .  the best stuff is in throwaway details in the background , such as sahara's perfume ads : "" depression - it's not just a state of mind "" .  but to find humor in the superficiality of models and actors is to shoot fish in a barrel .  and , unfortunately , the film's forays outside the realm of comedy are pathetic .  take for example the film's framing device of an old lady and her dog .  the story serves absolutely no purpose , makes little sense , and is completely tangential to the main plotlines of the movie .  matthew modine and catherine keener have the most sympathetic characters in the film , but they're stuck in the most boring plotlines .  modine whines and complains and would be completely pathetic if he was matched against someone stronger than elizabeth berkley , who appears as another struggling actor .  keener's character has a stronger edge , but the insult self-defense class ( taught by denis leary , no less ) she is stuck in makes little sense .  the movie's running time is under two hours , but it seems like it is well over it .  there's just not enough humor to speed things along , and not enough meaning to propel any drama .

0|"the ads for "" batman and robin "" scream "" the event of the summer is here "" and that's the problem .  the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it .   "" batman and robin "" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance .  it's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun .  it wasn't always this way .  tim burton's "" batman "" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge .  the film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel .  batman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night .  the joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent .  batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city's breathtaking gothic skyline .  those days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck .   "" batman and robin "" has far more in common with the campy 60's batman tv show than with tim burton's tale of darkness .  the blame lies with director joel schumacher .  a former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes .  unfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn't the faintest notion of what to do .   "" batman and robin "" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it's often difficult to tell who's whacking who .  while the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti .  a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film .   "" batman and robin "" doesn't merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions .  it's rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one .  ironically , the parts of "" batman and robin "" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne .  easily the best batman yet , clooney's expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn't even hint at .  the film's most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne's butler and surrogate father .  as for the other heroes , chris o'donnell's robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl .  in a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne's girlfriend is puzzling .  i suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight .  of course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that's where "" batman and robin "" really suffers .  as mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion .  laboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he's having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act .  uma thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy .  she overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it's apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) .  once thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss .  thurman fails to maintain the character's maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film .  the biggest lesson to be learned from "" batman and robin "" is that more is not better .  joel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is .  some critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam .  i don't think so .  my prescription ?  fire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist's convention so he'll understand that there's no hard feelings ) .  give alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o'donnell and michael gough .  call jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman .  then , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the "" event "" mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time .

0|deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie .  this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises , and , being true to its title , being deceptive .  but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit .  braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute ( renee zellweger ) .  their lone suspect is wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker's pocket .  however , a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators , as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables .  braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives .  braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook ( ellen burstyn ) , a local bookie .  kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite ( rosanna arquette ) , believing his wife to be unfaithful .  the plot is twisty and complex , with lots of lengthy flashbacks , and plenty of surprises .  however , there are times when it is needlessly complex , and at least one instance the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost .  take a look at l . a . confidential , or the film's more likely inspiration , the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled .  the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot .  for example , the film tells a few substories ( such as the tale of a woeful absinthe bender , or an alternative telling of how van gogh lost his ear ) , but they are so flat and so plastic that they come off as prefabricated and unbelievable .  there's never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation .  they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay .  the characters , themselves , are rather pathetic and despicable .  not one of them is an ounce sympathetic , and as a result , the labyrinthine plot is all for naught .  what does it matter who is guilty of what and why ?  writer-directors josh and jonas pate seem to desire to emulate the coen brothers' masterwork blood simple , or the wachowski brothers' less worthy bound .  but , while they have got the plot twists down cold , they need to work on characterization and dialogue .  |-0.6999999999999998|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|"The general consensus from these explanations is that the text expresses a negative sentiment towards the movie ""Deceiver"" due to its overly constructed plot, muddled storytelling, flat dialogue, and unsympathetic characters, which are compared unfavorably to other films with more complex plots and better execution."
0|this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney's live- action george of the jungle .  tarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough's legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far .  badly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves .  i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie .  furthermore , it's even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence .  and , while i'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production .  of course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line .  imagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like .  with its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse .  anyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect .  the only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) .  the film doesn't attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough .  instead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) .  he is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble .  meanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization .  on the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals .  one shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help .  with lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born .  its patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability .  with his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal .  his pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off .  jane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her .  some six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud's steamy the lover .  since then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency .  tarzan continues this trend .  march may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can't act .  meanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy .  instead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance .  the story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies .  the problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless .  the romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane's presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance .  the special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) .  and , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals .  over the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material .  the most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) .  weismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number .  and , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 .  |-0.85|0.9666666666666667|0.9|"The sentiment of the explanations is overwhelmingly negative, as the reviewers express their disappointment and criticize various aspects of ""Tarzan and the Lost City"", including the execution, concept, entertainment value, acting abilities, script, humor, action, romantic elements, special effects, and overall quality of the film."
0|" "" desperate measures "" is a generic title for a film that's beyond generic .  it's also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more "" before and after "" than "" reversal of fortune . ""  the movie is a big disappointment , and yet it's somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing .  too bad the execution's all wrong , though , because the set-up of "" desperate measures "" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use .  san francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission .  even worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society .  connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he's at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital .  when he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy .  one misstep "" desperate measures "" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt's illness .  what's needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow .  take , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital .  the police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ?  he shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight .  connor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son .  whatever .  to be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie's problems .  first and foremost is how cheaply "" desperate measures "" trades the potential of it's opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour .  once mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills .  there are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away .  also , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia's frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; "" desperate measures "" appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie's head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this .  there is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department .  cast against type , michael keaton's understated menace is highly effective .  although he's not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord .  joseph cross , as garicia's ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos .  this cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost .  it goes without saying that "" desperate measures "" needs an operation of its very own .

""  although williams turns in one of his least inspired roles , he is easily the most lively of the actors .  everyone else comes across as half-asleep .  the re-make is successful in that respect .  it feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties .  i remember the original as being charming , but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years .  there have been some updates .  fred macmurray's flying model t has been replaced by a t-bird .  his faithful dog charlie is now "" weebo "" , the hovering robot .  the biggest change is that , with sophisticated computer animation , we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining .  flubber is anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality .  the gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number .  this has nothing to do with the story .  the only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys .  not that contributing little to the plot is a big problem .  there are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do don't make sense .  the discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford .  anyone with half a brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions .  it's unbelievable that his lover ( well , probably not a lover -- after all this is disney ) starts dating croft after the aborted wedding .  there's not one appealing component of this man .  after the professor discovers that smearing a golf ball with the gunk causes it to bounce uncontrollably around his lab wreaking havoc , i cringed as he picked up a bowling ball .  this guy is beyond forgetful , venturing into the certifiable .  co-writer john hughes used to direct light-weight but thoughtful teen films .  the care behind "" pretty in pink "" and "" the breakfast club "" all went out the window after his "" home alone "" franchise heated up the box offices .  looking much like "" home alone 3 1/2 "" , "" flubber "" even features a couple of vapid goons who get banged around and a cute little boy who screams a lot .  in some ways , it's difficult to judge this film .  i have a suspicion that i'm not it's target audience .  after all , i measure my age in two digits .

0|"ever watch a very young child try and tell a joke that is beyond his , or her , sophistication ?  it's full of stops and starts and usually , the punch line is ruined .  i felt the same way watching drowning mona .  skip a stone across water and you approximate the depth of this attempt at an ensemble comedy .  there are some slightly successful attempts at humor , but they only serve as window dressing .  there is a running gag about the town , verplanck , n . y . , being a test town for the then new yugo .  everyone drives a yugo , differentiating their cars with personalized license plates .  even the police chief drives one .  there is a certain sublimeness to the image of a lights and siren decked out yugo skittering its way through the town streets .  there also is a running gag about one of the characters , jeff , missing a hand and how it occurred .  it pokes gentle fun at the notion of urban legends .  it turns out the truth is more horrifying than any legend .  there are some sight gags that pop up as well , such as mona's tombstone , which reads "" demoted "" , instead of devoted .  still , the core of the story maintains the flatness of a still pond .  the lynchpin of the film falls on the redundant and sporadic scenes involving mona ( midler ) .  each scene with her is the same : scream at someone , hit someone , then scream some more .  there's no uniqueness or modulation to her or explanation for her meanness .  anyone off the street could have played the role , such as it is .  the other characters are walking cardboard cutouts .  each one is defined by one trait and no further attempt is made at deeper characterization .  there is a burly , female car mechanic , so of course , there is a forced lesbianism gag .  mona's son , jeff ( marcus thomas ) is a simpleton , hence you can predict his dialogue before it even plods its way from his mouth .  chief of police rash ( devito ) likes broadway musicals and loves his daughter .  there's nothing more to him .  elle , the chief's daughter ( campbell ) , is bland personified , a dutiful girl with no higher aspiration than to have a child and be married .  mona's husband phil ( fichtner ) jeckle and hydes from shirking coward to reptilian letch .  bob ( affleck ) , elle's betrothed , and business partner to jeff , is a mumbling , obvious dullard .  there is no contrast to any of the characters .  by having at least one character with some wit , or wits , to serve as counterpoint to the others , perhaps steinfeld's attempt at satirizing a small town infested with ambitionless people might have come off better .  ostensibly a murder mystery , drowning mona gives you almost all the clues immediately , then lets you sit back and feel superior as you watch the cast of paper people fumble their way to finding the killer , who could be anyone due to mona's loving manner with everyone on town .  even that aspect of the film fails , throwing in a convenient , ridiculous and unsatisfying wrap to things .  it's been a while since i walked away from a movie theater in an angry mood .  what makes it all the more remarkable is that i rarely remember a comedy making me so angry for wasting my time at it's ineptitude .

0|"maybe this mission should have been scrubbed  mission to mars  a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman  there's a world of difference between artists and technicians .  the artist has a vision to create something new .  he may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it's something you've never seen before .  a good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it's going to be just a xerox .  obviously successful films need both skills .  brian de palma is a masterful technician .  he's spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock .  he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote .  aside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead .  in de palma's latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick .  to tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called "" 2001 "" .  i enjoyed it even more when it was titled "" close encounters "" .  nasa has set its sights for mars .  when the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet .  they don't do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe .  and it's all so boring .  there are so many scenes that just don't work , it's difficult to begin .  when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from "" dune "" ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching .  error .  the most interesting character ( and that's not saying much ) is killed off .  error .  the alien is laughable .  error .  the rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable .  error .  there's some nice eyecandy .  the face on mars , which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head , looks cool .  a three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world .  maneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic .  but there's so much more that feels as if we've been there before .  from "" 2001 "" , there's the rotating space station , the blinding white room .  >from "" close encounters "" , they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens .  the list goes on .  the actors are mostly mobile wooden statues .  even gary sinise and tim robbins can't muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing .  no one seems to care about anything that happens .  you won't either .  the absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr . pepper , with a 20 foot tall logo , saves the day .  they should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film .

0|mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival .  as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival .  it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time .  in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry .  toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart .  the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it .  something else is what he did .  the film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life .  she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep .  meanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada .  she wants to build a career as an actress .  betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow .  she does not know who the woman is .  she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is .  they fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not .  meanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own .  he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) .  these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong .  there is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion .  in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits .  a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun .  lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film .  he just chooses not to .  as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason .  there are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches .  the film is a little long for the subject matter .  toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot .  unfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers .  i will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  mulholland drive spoiler warning .  i have rated this film fairly low .  you should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film .  david lynch is in large part a dark satirist .  most of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside .  in mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre .  what he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? )  playing off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on .  the first 80% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout .  then suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something .  the audience expectation is that they will add up .  but he has given clues that are self-contradictory .  lynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories .  in fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke .  there is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties .  mad magazine called it a poiuyt .  other sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar .  look at small portions of it and makes sense .  look at the whole figure and it does not .  this film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar .  |-0.3|0.7833333333333333|0.7333333333333334|"The film ""Mulholland Drive"" receives mixed feelings due to its strong start but eventual downfall, confusing and contradictory plot, negative reception at the Toronto International Film Festival, and the director's decision to take a different approach towards the end. This leads to a slightly negative sentiment towards the film."

0|"watching the movie , i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup , cute 'n cuddly , computer-generated monkey .  if the monkey died , the movie got an extra half star .  alas , the monkey showed up at the end , unharmed , to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs .  what that means is that lost in space actually deserved 2 stars .  that's pretty generous , considering the movie's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek .  when will robinson ( jack johnson ) teaches his pet robot about friendship , you are actually supposed to buy it .  so why such a seemingly high rating ?  there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage .  first , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater .  the sound and screen kicked ass .  nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don't necessarily mean that in a good way ) .  also , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie's tension .  i even liked the computer-generated settings .  i usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i've seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities .  also , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain .  william hurt isn't too bad either .  neither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable .  and perhaps i shouldn't admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood .  there is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a "" real "" kiss -- no sex ) .  it felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six .  those movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven .  that type of moviemaking is a lost art .  now for the bad news .  worst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue .  it's squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction .   "" you better hold on to your joystick , "" is one such line .  and when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign .  second worst , and closely related , is the screenplay .  the story's exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what's happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest .  once the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived .  when gary oldman easily reprograms will's pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : "" he flipped the switch to 'evil . ' ""  then there's the tone of the movie .  the colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson .  then it could be an adventure movie .  they're mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn't a good enough actor to carry it off .  still , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination .  just because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn't mean that we have to bow to a "" promise keepers "" notion of who's the center of a family .  many quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect .  and the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie .  in star wars , the rebels were the good guys .  we were rooting for those who were fighting against the system .  in lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free .  that ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists .  finally , a few specific details deserve criticism .  the movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 .  why ?  why bother saying what year this is .  just tell us it's the future .  i bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 .  setting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won't be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) .  then there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole .  this silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny's barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven't learned a thing about ergonomics .  one vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool .  the strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip .  this is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie .  but if that's the best part of the movie , i can't in good conscience recommend it .  still , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your "" bad movie bingo "" cards .

0|i was going to see ram shrasta on the big screen last night , but before that i stopped into my video store to rent some movies .  luckily , my video guy was in the middle or recording ram shrasta !  i knew it was going to be a bad print with only half-faces and poor sound quality , but i couldn't help myself . . .  i got it .  well , after watching it ( it indeed was a bad print ) i was glad i didn't dish out $7 to waste three hours of my time sitting in a bad theatre watching a bad movie .  this movie really sucks .  it had so many inconsistencies it was driving me crazy ! !  for example , how can jackie shroff grow two feet of hair in just three or four days ?  jackie shroff looked really stupid with his steven seagal ponytail .  the songs are bad , the acting is bad ( especially deepti bhatnagar's ) , and the direction is the worst of all .  the comedy scenes with jagdish and johnny lever just made me want to throw up .  i didn't even finish the movie . . .  i couldn't take it anymore .  note : but if anyone out there liked aatish ( by the same director ) , i guess you'd like this movie .  it's practically the same except that sanjay dutt is replaced with jackie shroff .  aditya panscholi is the sidekick again .

0|"starship troopers is a bad movie .  i mean , a really , really , bad movie .  not only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) .  looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme .  that being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who's logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth .  the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) .  as the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another's hand .  eventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet .  as our faster than light travelling "" heroes "" arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . .   "" what ? ""  you say , "" laser beam weapons ?  sonic weapons ?  phasers ?  photon cannons ? "" .  nope , they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns , pump action rifles , and tactical nuclear weapons !  i guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry .  as the assault begins , our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon .  two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them , and one even sees a streak fly by , but disregards it as nothing .  this of course , leads to more massive carnage , blood shed , and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies .  again , i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons !  in the end , we see neil patrick "" doogie howser "" harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat , hat , and gloves .  he does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug , and then proclaims that the bugs are scared !  this sets the troopers into a frenzy , as they are now one step closer to completing their goal , total genocide of a species ( again , sound familiar ? ? ) .  i have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review , but given it's non-existence , i may have anyway .  i could go on for pages ripping this movie apart , but don't want to bore you too badly .  in short , i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro-nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies , a drivers education accident scene film , and a complete blank screen ( the plot , of course ) .  i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone , anywhere , under any circumstance .  copyright ( c ) 1997 tim jandt "" >  "|-0.9|0.9333333333333332|0.9333333333333332|"The reviewers unanimously express strong negative sentiments towards the movie ""Starship Troopers,"" criticizing various aspects such as the plot, characters, violence, and thematic elements.
