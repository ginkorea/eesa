1|"a common complaint amongst film critics is "" why aren't there more literate scripts available ? ""  quiz show gives signs of hope that the art of writing isn't dead in hollywood and that we need not only look to independent films for thoughtful content .  paul attanasio's script takes what could have been a tepid thriller ( the quiz show scandals of the late 50s ) and delivers a telling parable about the emptiness of the post war american dream and the golden bubble that surrounds and protects tv networks and their sponsors .  the film is riddled with telling symbols ( e . g .  a '58 chrysler , a radio announcement of sputnik ) but is never heavy handed .  deft direction by robert redford and keen performances by ralph fiennes , john turturro and rob morrow dovetail perfectly with the carefully honed script .  redford departs from the usually overlight , "" cable tv quality "" sets and camera work so common in recent 20th century period pieces .  quiz show perfectly captures the colors and textures of the eisenhower years .  although i was only 4 years old when the "" twenty one "" scandal broke , enough of the 50s icons survived throughout my childhood for me to recognize the authenticity of redford's almost tangible palette .  from plastic covered furniture to carefully coifed contestants , the images ring true from that era of rampant consumerism , of a generation that had gone through 15 years of depression and world war without "" disposable income , "" before the manifestation of its american dream .  the film deftly weaves several themes together , from assimilation and exclusion of jews from "" the good life , "" to the lengths that a scion of a literary family will go to to match his father's fame .  though the 50s audience that is "" rocked "" by this scandal may initially seem naive to us , they should appear all too familiar , with our current national passion for the rise and fall of icons like michael jackson or tonya harding .  charles van doren and herbie stemple were the overnight mega celebrities of their day .  the tv audience is almost a fourth main character , always at the center of the decisions being made on their behalf .  at the film's end , the credits roll past slow motion footage of that same 50s tv audience , mindlessly laughing at some piece of fluff .  like the distorted mirror that captured a blurred swastika at the end of cabaret , this "" mirror "" may reflect an image we're not all that comfortable with .

1|whew . this film oozes energy , the kind of breakneck , no- holds-barred , in-your-face risk-taking filmmaking that is seldom seen on screen these days .  like the marginal , motley bunch of post-apocalyptic youths director danny boyle tries to depict , trainspotting veers on the edge of utter mayhem but ultimately retains its footing and control .  the result : a movie that is a delightful example of how the medium is the message .  the message : a bunch of losers with loser names , mark renton ( ewan mcgregor ) , spud ( ewan bremner ) , sick boy ( jonny lee miller ) , tommy ( kevin mckidd ) , and begbie ( robert carlyle ) .  bored , aimless and restless , their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub , grooving to techno or glam-rock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods , some ingenious , others plainly dumb and desperate .  not part of the daily dose if obtained , sex is a bonus .  you can find these characters as they are , foul-mouthed , dirty , pathetic , ugly perhaps but definitely interesting , in irvin welsh's cult novel of the same name .  what makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message .  one of the first things you'll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly .  it'll truck into a character's pimple , just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot .  distracted and curious , it'll maintain a character's eye-level or drop right to the ground to show the doped-out-eye-view .  you'll even find characters peering into the camera , their faces smeared across the wide-angle lens .  this film camera is just another one of the guys .  tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality , boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message across .  bored kids daydream and bored kids deprived of a heroin fix have nightmares .  i don't want to give too much away , but if you cross chuckie from child's play with some of the wacky fantasies in heavenly creatures , you might have an idea just how fun or pants-wetting scary the alternate state of consciouness can be .  that said , this film has a good share of drugs - consumed , vomitted , defecated , pissed off , exchanged , bought , sold , injected , smuggled , enjoyed and regretted .  if that isn't your cup of tea , nobody forced you to see the film .  stay at home and rent up close and personal .  and what's a buzz without tunes .  from pulp to iggy pop ( yes , he's still alive ) , the aural landscape is as engaging as the visual energy permeating the film .  good and bad vibrations tangle like the conflicting desires and values of the message .  every once in a while , a film comes along with the kind of energetic filmmaking that matches the intensity of its characters it hopes to depict .  trainspotting is that shooting star that burns across a sky littered with static constellations .  dom is a part-time filmmaker who graduated from northwestern university's radio/tv/film programme not too long ago .  he has laboured on various music videos and short films in and around campus and chicago .  nowhere town , a 26min short film that he shot , co-directed and co-produced recently scooped up the grand jury prize at the charleston international film festival for best student production .  he is currently finishing a couple of small projects .  with his minute amounts of leisure time , dom does nell impersonations .  |0.9466666666666667|0.9|0.9|"The reviewers are highly positive about the film ""Trainspotting"", praising its energetic and risk-taking style, interesting characters, and successful execution of various filmmaking techniques."
1|"steven spielberg's "" amistad , "" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship , then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who "" owned "" them , is concerned with several different aspects of this story .  first , the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery .  second , it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case , including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) .  last , and most importantly , it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade .   "" amistad "" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements .  i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another "" anti-slavery "" movie .  having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery , i doubted that there was much i didn't already know about it .  fortunately , i turned out to be wrong .  for one thing , spielberg's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa , so "" amistad "" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning .  and some of the images here are , in fact , much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery .  one scene in the middle , in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their "" excess "" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown , has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year .  spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would , and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating .  the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians , such as president van buren and queen isabella of spain , whose naval officers were involved in the legal dispute and who was only a small child at the time .  exposing politicians as narrow-minded , opportunistic hypocrites is fairly standard stuff , of course , but spielberg and writer david franzoni do it well enough that it still comes off as something more than just a simple exercise in audience manipulation .  the film also examines the contentious nature of the slavery issue at the time , such that john quincy adams ( and probably other politicians like him ) , who clearly disapproved of the practice , was reluctant to get involved in the case until it was appealed all the way to the supreme court .  the biggest success of "" amistad "" is probably the characterization of cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , who emerges as the de facto leader of the kidnapped africans and struggles to communicate with baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , the lawyer who represents them in court .  through cinque , we are given a window into the native culture , as he and the displaced africans try to explain to the prison guards what they need for a proper burial of a dead tribe member , or find an illustrated version of the bible and try to understand the story of jesus christ .  cinque sees the dispute with a clarity and simplicity that , again , contrasts with the technicalities and mechanics of the legal process and of the political squabbles .   "" what kind of country is this , where laws 'almost' work ? "" he asks baldwin in bewilderment , when he learns that the case must be re-tried before the supreme court .  spielberg's direction tends a little bit towards the manipulative side at times , such as when he adds a heavy orchestral swell to cinque's angry outburst in the court room .  still , there isn't enough of this for it to be a serious problem .  the main flaw in this film , which prevents it from earning four stars , is that it seems like spielberg and franzoni can't quite handle all of these issues at the same time , so instead they settle for addressing each one separately and simply editing the results into the same movie .  this summer's contact , for example , dealt with several issues at once , but each of them was somehow present in almost every scene and , most importantly , all of them were resolved at once .   "" amistad "" tries to pull it all together in the end with a speech from adams , but it somehow feels a little forced , and in any case the speech itself , which lasts almost fifteen minutes , wears out its welcome about halfway through .  perhaps the best way to describe it is this : "" amistad "" is three four star films edited into one .  almost every individual scene works , but the final product is lacking the necessary focus and coherence , and thus is less than the sum of its parts .  however , i can't honestly say how it could have been done differently , and in any case the story comes through with enough raw emotional power that it is still a very good film , and thus i recommend it to anyone who can handle the disturbing imagery .

1|"he has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , raised and cared for and imprisoned by his domineering mother .  she inspires his love and his fear , and instills in him a similar love and fear of jesus .  he has a rudimentary grasp of language , mouthing monosyllables and repetitions of his mother's phrases .  he is taught that the world outside is fatally poisonous ; his mother dons a gasmask whenever she goes out the door .  he is 35-years-old in body , but a child in mind and spirit .  he is the premise for bad boy bubby , a defiantly original australian movie about a man called bubby ( nicholas hope ) who has spent his entire life in an awful little apartment , etc . , etc . then one day his father ( ralph cotterill ) appears .  his father is a shabby down-at-heels priest who appears to have permanently misplaced his religion .  unsurprisingly , he is not thrilled with the way "" his "" boy has turned out .  he is , however , rather pleased at renewing his acquaintance with the mother ( claire benito ) , and , more to the point , her ample breasts .  soon they are copulating on the dingy couch , while bubby crouches , confused , in the next room , acutely aware that the mother who had devoted all her attention to him has a new interest .  bubby's relationship to the world may be warped , but it is at least stable .  the father's arrival disturbs his precarious balance , causing an oedipal conflict which ends--freud would be pleased--in violence and , as a result , freedom .  bubby intuits from his father's arrival that the air outside is breathable : he leaves the apartment , his past , his world , behind .  so far , so good .  the first thirty minutes or so of bad boy bubby , which bring us to this point , are quite brilliant .  the movie is at its best when its stays within the constraints of bubby's hermetic two-room universe .  it follows through unrelentingly on the implications of its premise : bubby is used by his mother for sex , he unwittingly suffocates the pet cat with cellophane , he is terrifed by the notion that jesus will beat him senseless if he sins .  it is grim and savage and appalling , but also strangely tender--de heer , having imagined a life as bizarre as bubby's , does not exaggerate for comic or grotesqe purposes , but simply empathizes .  he observes what it might be like .  the intensity of these opening scenes , with their minimalist mise-en-scene , immerses us in a claustrophobic environment which seems to be a decayed stratum of our own world , and owes much to david lynch's eraserhead , not least the ambient industrial white noise of the soundtrack .  for thirty minutes , the movie maintains the feel and mood of a reality that does not seem far removed from our own .  then de heer lets bubby out , brings him into contact with our world , and the film never quite recovers .  our unlikely hero finds himself in port adelaide , where he wanders the streets and meets people , where he suffers and learns and survives .  he is seduced by a young woman from a salvation army band ( how an anti-social half-wit with no sense of hygiene manages to get laid mere hours after his escape is not the sort of question the film encourages , wisely ) ; he is given free pizza by a sympathetic waitress ; he insults a traffic cop and is punched in the stomach ; he shares a few beers in the back of a truck with a rock group ; he is imprisoned and raped ; he becomes a translator for mentally handicapped people whose speech is impaired beyond comprehension ; he is loved by a motherly large-breasted nurse ( carmel johnson ) .   .   .  it goes on , by turns inventive , silly , tasteless , endearing , and sometimes all of these things at once .  de heer never seems to be sure how bubby should interface with the real world : the tone shifts , uneasily , from fable to realism to satire and back again .  the scenes which try to touch base with a believable version of reality are the weakest ; the film is best understood as a kind of parable , and , indeed , the religious implications of bubby's experiences are foregrounded : icons of jesus on the cross hang from the mother's walls , bubby dons a priest's collar stolen from his father , a church organ-playing atheist lectures him on the necessity of unbelief , the woman who redeems him is named angel .  the manifold stresses of our world do not shatter bubby's mind , do not fragment him into psychosis ; rather , the world accomodates him , and heals him .  although de heer's touch is at times overbearing , bubby's salvation is touching ; what seemd at first a harsh lesson in the damaging effects of the social construction of reality becomes a na ? ve humanist tale of improbable hope .  a hapless rock group write a song about bubby and sing it for him and so give him the gift of community .  he returns the favour when he steps on stage one night and becomes their frontman , turning the fragmented impressions of his experiences into performance art , and turning the band into a popular draw .  innocence triumphs .  bubby becomes a holy fool , an idiot savant , and graces us with wisdom .  it's a strange turn of events , but by now we shouldn't be surprised , because bad boy bubby ain't like other movies .

1|"being that it is a foreign language film with no known names with a select number theaters showing it , "" shall we dance "" won't be seen by that many people .  and that's a shame - this is a funny , enchanting , and goofy movie full of laughs , surprises , and wonderful dance sequences .  the surprising thing about "" shall we dance "" is the universal appeal of the story .  a us version is in the works , and it's no wonder - it's not really all that culture specific .  although there is a narrated set-up that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings ( about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing ) , the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer isn't at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film .  the only important unexplained japanese-specific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that 1000 yen is roughly $10 ( when you see the film - and you should see this film - you'll know why ) .  a middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life ( a house , a child , and good marriage ) still doesn't translate into a fulfilled life .  after glimpsing a melancholy beauty looking out from a dance studio window while on the train home from work , sugiyana ( koji yakusho ) decides after some trepidation to take up ballroom dance lessons in order to meet the woman who has stirred something in himself .  after finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant and beautiful mai ( tamiyo kusakari ) too rich for his blood , sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her .  we then meet the players in this gem of a movie , who all have their own reasons for joining the class .  later on , we meet aoki at the dance studio ( naoto takenaka ) , a co-worker and all out weirdo and one of the laugh riot highlights of the film .  the story , laughs , and touching scenes evolve as the movie goes along .  it's a pleasure to watch such a wonderful film that is propelled almost solely by the characters and performances .  it's difficult to explain the charms of the film without revealing too much - the movie abounds with little revelations that subtly shape the characters , and in the end , each one is that much fuller and more understood by the time you leave the theater .  it's one of those movies that only the french seem to make anymore - no big plot , no special effects , no gunplay , no tragic consequences , no forced examinations of the nature of love , and no insights into the nature of evil .  just a warm , funny , endearing film that will charm the pants off of you .  when was the last time you left a theater feeling all warm and fuzzy inside ?

1|"when i first heard of contact , the hype was building it up as a sci-fi blockbuster .  now , with that in mind , coupled with the knowledge of jodie foster's involvement in the project , i thought "" what in the world is foster doing in a sci-fi blockbuster ? ? ? "" .  as it turned out , my expectations were completely nullified and turned topsy-turvy .  robert zemeckis , back from the euphoria created by his last film , forrest gump , once again proves his mastery in fusing tales of adventure with along the endearing lines of human spirit .  don't get me wrong , contact is sci-fi ? but with a definite difference .  based on the late carl sagan novel of the same name , the story delves itself in questions on science and god ; fact and faith .  allie ( foster ) is a radio astronomer .  she spends her time listening to the stars , via ultra-huge communication dishes in search of intelligent life beyond the solar system .  her passion for `long-distance communication' is the result of her younger days being spent avidly in front of a ham-radio system ( a hobbyist radio communication device ) which her late-father bought for her .  a scene which particularly strengthens the audiences' view of the passion is when she asked her father whether she could contact her late-mother through the ham-radio system in which her father replied "" not even the most powerful radio in the world can do that , now "" .  allie's research is based on the seti project ( search for extra terrestrial intelligence ) , in which she listens to radio emissions from other galaxies in the hope of finding one which would suggest intelligent manipulation .  her work has never been off the scrutiny of the us government , which considers it a waste of taxpayer's money and politically unviable , her supervisor ( tom skerritt ) pulls the plug on seti .  undaunted , allie managed to gather a loyal group of `believers' and eventually found funding from a large private corporation .  the following months were treacherous to their hopes and research as they are contantly pressured by the government but all that changed when one day , she caught an emission of a seemingly intelligent repeating sound-wave .  the news of her find attracted hordes of alien believers , cultist , the media and of course , the government .  the situation became intense upon her discovery of pictorial plans on building a form of transport which were embedded within the repeating sound emission .  as the world join forces to build this transport , allie is desperate to be the one to go .  she enrols herself among a few hopefuls , to represent the world when the transport is ready for operation .  her eligibility for the spot failed when she is questioned on her beliefs in the existence of god by the president's spiritual advisor ( mcconaughey ) ; allie , being an atheist , a result of her belief in fact and science , refuses to budge upon questioning .  at this point the movie plot thickens considerably as she is romantically involved with the president's spiritual advisor .  a strong point which propelled the movie is the depth of its main characters played by foster and mcconaughey .  from the very first meeting scene , it is obvious that the two of them was sort of kindred spirits but they were worlds apart in almost all aspects , foster being a person drawn to science and facts and mcconaughey being one who believes in faith , hope and the power of the unseen .  the meeting of their worlds , added with the situation which they are put into makes the entire storytelling process near flawless .  many people who read the synopsis of this film would find it a tad too ridiculous , but by actually immersing yourself in it , gives you an entirely different perspective ; one which is free from bias and pre-conceptions .  zemeckis and his team of screen writers have done a remarkable job in telling this tale through film .  contact works by not delving in controversy but rather , touches the thinking audience , urging them to ponder upon the questions raised in the film concerning fact and faith ; whether one can actually find compromise within .  i consider contact as one of the must-sees for this year .

1|"you've got to love disney .  no matter what they serve up , it is a guaranteed success as long as it's animated .  kids have to go see the movie .  then they have to get the toys .  oh , the video came out ?  got to buy it , or risk little billy's temper tantrums for the next month .  all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca : a visit to the magic kingdom .  stay at the disneyland hotel !  buy a disney t-shirt !  eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick !  it's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it .  dale carnegie should have had it so good .  what's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality .  you see , disney animated features these days have two components : theme and plot .  the theme changes with each new movie ; the plot does not .  the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped , and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features , they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same .  however , while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box-office receipts , merchandising dollars , and glimmers in the eyes of little children , critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer .  luckily , disney's latest animated offering , mulan , manages to be engaging and refreshing , even while rife with formula .  the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns , led by the imposing shan-yu ( miguel ferrer ) .  soon , china's emperor ( pat morita ) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china's defense .  when the fa family is served notice , it is the elderly father , fa zhou ( soon-tek oh ) who must answer the call , as there are no other males in the household .  fearing her father will surely be killed in battle , fa mulan ( ming-na wen ) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army .  mulan , based on a chinese epic poem , is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling .  mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family , as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman's role , and in a very amusing scene where a matchmaker attempts to assess her value to a potential husband , we see that "" grace "" is not one of her strong points .  very early on , we are presented with the high importance of bringing honor to one's family , and by botching her chance at gaining the favor of the matchmaker , mulan fails at that task .  by leaving home to fight in her father's place , she may not only spare his life , but bring honor , too .  as is the case with most disney musicals , the songs are first rate and pervasive throughout the film .  i'm not sure if they will get much airplay , but at least one of the songs will no doubt receive recognition come oscar time .  both lea salonga , who provides the singing voice for mulan , and donny osmond who sings for shang , the captain of mulan's army unit and obligatory love interest , are more than competent , although salonga's voice translates much better to animation .  you have to hear it to understand .  interestingly , the musical numbers which are so often done with big flourishes are surprisingly muted in mulan .  there is no significantly big number , which is customary as the second or third song in a disney film , but this does not detract significantly from the rest of the movie .  it is , however , an expectation which has been built by disney's own formulaic history , and some viewers may feel as if something is missing .  artistically , the animators have chosen to adopt the more subdued pastels of chinese artwork , and although this may not live up to the vibrance so associated with many of the other disney works , it helps to contribute a more authentic , and therefore more credible , nature to what otherwise may be seen as a typically "" disneyfied "" ethnic tale .  there are also a couple of visually standout scenes , one involving the charge of shan-yu's hun army , which utilizes the same computer-enhanced imagery disney animators have employed since the chandelier in beauty and the beast .  the other scene worth mentioning is so quick you might miss it .  when mulan resolves to take her father's place , she dons her father's old battle armor , and unsheathes a sword .  as she does so , you can see her reflection in the polished metal .  it just left me thinking , "" that was really cool . ""  a wonderful range of performances delight the audience throughout the film , varying from the straight , such as soon-tek oh as fa zhou , to the comical , such as harvey fierstein as yao , a gruff , pugilistic member of shang's conscripted army .  even more outrageous is eddie murphy as mushu , the diminutive guardian dragon sent to look after mulan .  although an obvious attempt to relive the chemistry brought forth by robin williams in aladdin , murphy nevertheless distinguishes himself with his own winning performance .  i found the choice of b . d .  wong as shang a little strange ( you may remember him as martin short's wedding planner assistant in the father of the bride ) , but they used robbie benson for the voice of the beast in beauty and the beast , so i guess anything's possible .  in any event , wong performs admirably as well .  one character which provides a significant amount of humor is grandmother fa .  she deserves recognition not only because of the levity she brings to the movie , but also because she is voiced by two very remarkable people .  june foray , who supplies grandmother fa's speaking voice , is a venerable voice actress who may be best known for her work as rocky the squirrel and natasha fatale ( as in boris and natasha ) .  marni nixon , who provides grandmother fa's singing voice , is the same vocalist who dubbed the voices for anna in the king and i , maria in west side story , and eliza in my fair lady .  with this in mind , hearing grandmother fa is like listening to a little piece of history .  mulan is the latest disney animated feature to get away from some of the eurocentrism which for so long dominated disney films .  in an effort to be culturally sensitive ( and to avoid a "" miss saigon "" -type debacle ) , disney has also wisely chosen to employ many asian-american actors for both lead and supporting roles .  in addition to the actors already mentioned , the cast includes such ubiquitous talents as james hong , gedde watanabe , james shigeta , and george takei .  i guess clyde kusatsu wasn't available .  at a running time of slightly under an hour and a half , mulan moves quickly and provides solid entertainment for both children and , happily , adults .  this is the kind of disney feature that makes you wonder what they will do next , rather than hope that the next one is better .

"" stay away from my son "" margaret warns darby reese .  her words , however , appear to fall on deaf ears as reese turns up drunk at the family homestead later that evening , urging beau to join him in the boathouse .  there are words and advances and some pushing and shoving and beau runs back into the house , passed his startled mother , as the crack of a wooden railing giving way breaks the cold blue silence and an intoxicated reese tumbles out of sight .  the next day , on her morning walk , margaret discovers reese's lifeless body lying crumpled on the shoreline , a boat anchor impaled in his chest .  with her maternal instincts working overtime , margaret quickly ferries the body out into the lake , weighs it down , and dumps it overboard .  but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated .  soon after the body is discovered , snagged on a local fisherman's line , margaret is paid a visit by an attractive-seeming blackmailer in a red nova .  alek spera threatens to hand over compromising videotape of beau to the police unless margaret comes up with $50 , 000 by 4 o'clock the next day .  but margaret's life is about to get a lot more complicated , for alek turns out to be something she never expected .  based on elisabeth sanxay holding's novel "" the blank wall , "" "" the deep end "" is a well-crafted thriller written and directed by scott mcgehee and david siegel ( "" suture "" ) .  it makes the most of a talented but not particularly well-known cast--goran visnjic plays alek with a suave likeability , jonathan tucker shines as the conflicted beau , peter donat is amusing as grandfather hall , and josh lucas has an equally small but effective role as the hapless darby reese .  the film is also lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and features an evocative score , courtesy peter nashel .  but it owes everything to british actress tilda swinton .  swinton , whose pale-faced ethereal beauty has graced many of derek jarman's films ( "" caravaggio , "" "" edward ii , "" "" the last of england "" ) , plays margaret hall in "" the deep end "" and , like charlotte rampling in this year's "" under the sand , "" turns in a commanding and accomplished performance .  margaret is a devoted mother who is willing to risk everything to protect the ones she loves , and swinton captures every frustration , every fear , every subtle examination and every fervent realization and every nervous oscillation of her being .  the role calls for an extremely wide range of emotions none the least of which is simply playing a mother beset with a multitude of domestic responsibilities .  many can relate to that , of course ; it's the murder cover-up and the blackmail and the fear of losing one's son that swinton so gracefully , so graciously , makes resonate with the truest of colors .  the end is deep all right , and there isn't a single shallow moment in tilda swinton's canon .

1|"i hate to burst your bubble , but after all the star power , mega bucks , screenwriters , directors , and cool trailers , men in black is not the best movie of the summer .  it's pretty good in it's own right , yes , but i would probably split the "" best movie "" honors among face/off , spawn , con air , and maybe event horizon .  it's main problem is that it's quickly forgettable , and i can't remember one truly good scene from it .  from con air , it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt .  in spawn , it was the "" living room hell "" conclusion at the end .  in event horizon , it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell's forces .  and all of face/off was pretty dang good .  but as for men in black , the only scene i still recall is when will smith is squishing all those giant roaches .  i remember it not for it's humor but because i am hate roaches with a passion and was pretty disgusted .  and yes , i did see mimic , which is something i'll touch on in a later review .  back to men in black ( is it just me , or does that sound funny ? )  i remember first hearing about men in black back when i was a comic geek in the 7th grade and read magazines like wizard , etc . ( for those of you who aren't comic-geeks , wizard is basically to comics what car and driver is to cars , what the new yorker is to high society , what boy's life is to boy scots .  okay , that one was pretty pathetic . )  few people know this , but men in black is based on a very obscure comic book that was , while not honest-politician-rare , very hard to find .  this was after the release of the high-grossing batman forever , and it said that tommy lee jones and chris o'donnell were being considered for the roles ( in the comic book , there were no black men in black .  kind of weird , huh ? )  all i can say is , thank god they didn't cast chris o'donnell .  i know i can't be the only person on the planet who thinks he's an annoying , preppie little snot . . .  sorry .  my apologies to o'donnell fans .  i actually had a 7th grade teacher who was a big comic collector and was set to buy some of the comics from him , anticipating rather craftily that , if the movie was a big hit , it would drive up the price of the comics rather nicely .  he decided not to sell them to me , because they were "" innappropriate "" .  hmm . . . .  so now you're probably wondering why i've wasted about 5 paragraphs with lame anecdotes from my junior high years .  good question .  i'll move on to the movie now .  as you probably already know , will smith and tommy lee jones ( agents k and j , respectively ) belong to a top secret agency known as divison 5 , or it's nickname mib ( men in black . )  men in black is a reference to the black suits and sunglasses the agents wear , and they're mission is to investigate reports of alien landings and keep the aliens under control while they're here on earth .  not to get too technical or spoil the plot for the 6 people in the world who haven't seen this movie , but a basically-big-roach-type-bug lands in a redneck farmer's yard , inhabits his body , and attempts to destroy the entire universe .  not bad , eh ? ( i have no idea why i just typed that .  i'm not even really paying attention anymore . )  the special effects are good yet dissapointing in men in black .  i found their main headquarters to be boring , as were the "" cool weapons "" they had .  the noisy cricket just plain sucked , no matter what anyone said .  and the movie definitely surprised me in tone , although it probably shoudln't have .  it's director , barry sonnenfield , is known for "" black humor "" , directing both addams family movies .  this movie was basically a "" black comedy "" , not an action/sci-fi like i expected from the trailers .  don't get me wrong on what i think of this movie .  it's not bad , i gave it * * * .  it was mostly entertaining throughout it's run , and had a very good ending , although i think i was the only person in the theater not amazed by it .  my diagnosis for this picture : a good weekend rental , but not worth a movie ticket .  of course , the movie is now long gone from theaters , but that's beside the point .  i think .

1|i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan .  i've seen some of his films ( silkwood , backdraft , unlawful entry ) and while he gave adequate performances , i have never been impressed with his work .  breakdown , then , is something of a surprise .  russell gives a fine performance , as do most of the cast , one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film .  to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true , but he does it no harm .  russell plays jeff , one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy ( kathleen quinlan ) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life .  while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and , left helpless and stranded , jeff waves down a passing truck driver ( j . t .  walsh ) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck .  because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians , jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help .  that , it seems , is the last time jeff ( or anyone else ) sees her .  breakdown has been compared to several movies : george sluizer's the vanishing ( the original , hopefully , not his appalling hollywood remake ) , steven spielberg's duel and any number of hitchcock films .  as with these , breakdown does not , for the most part , stray down the conventional path of the american action-thriller .  jeff does not become a gun-toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife , but instead becomes a scared , confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on .  when we do find out what has happened to amy , it does come as a slight disappointment , if only because it's too early in the film ; i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment , but this affects the film little .  russell , as mentioned earlier , is very good in his role , and kathleen quinlan is nowhere near as annoying as she was in apollo 13 .  j . t .  walsh , as the possibly evil truck driver , is terrific ; he is one of the best of the fine batch of character actors hollywood doesn't seem to know what to do with , but director jonathan mostow is on the right track here .  the reason he makes such a great villain is that he actually looks like a real person , one anyone would be able to trust , which makes the plot that much more believable .  breakdown is what hollywood doesn't make enough of , a great thriller with believable characters and scenes that do , indeed , have viewers on the edge of their seats .  one of the most genuinely exciting films i've seen in a long time .  |0.26666666666666666|0.8833333333333333|0.8333333333333334|"The majority of the explanations express a positive sentiment towards Kurt Russell's performance in ""Breakdown"" and praise the film's thrilling plot, believable characters, and ability to maintain suspense.

1|"with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable .  in fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer .  handing over the director's chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions .  instead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture .  what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created .  a film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it .  i never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have .  the terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear .  aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen .  with a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film .  in fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original .  perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be .  never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character .  sigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about .  placing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver's presence , a woman is the only suitable hero .  aliens begins 57 years after alien ended .  lieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened .  she explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but "" the company "" is doubtful .  they explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left .  despite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won't call the families back .  however , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley's story seems much more feasible .  one of the company's directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet .  this team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen ) .  burke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony .  arriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment .  the only survivor is 12 year old rebecca "" newt "" jorden ( carrie henn ) .  ripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt's surrogate mother .  ripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose .  aliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott's version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general .  alien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo .  aliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened .  then again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day .  he is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film .  it seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload .  with perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion .  i can't recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment .  just when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again .  with a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history .  this scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen .  using flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety .  of course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see .  aliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release .  the special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them .  one of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner .  horner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work .  not only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers ) .  in fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music .  the production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy .  dark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations .  normally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer .  then , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense .  some of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley .  surprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best .  sigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona .  weaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to .  carrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude .  lance henriksen is terrific as bishop , showing that androids don't always have to be flat characters .  jenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role , and steals several scenes of her own ( though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn't fighting ) .  michael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film .  however , biehn does a good job , making it seem original again .  paul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv's "" mad about you "" ) .  a very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film , making it stand out from others .  aliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror .  aliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film .  aliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality .  cameron certainly knows how to make a good action film , but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen .  technically astonishing , aliens' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed .  aside from this , you probably won't experience anything like aliens for quite a while .

'the rainmaker' plays out like a personality sketch of young rudy as he gets emotionally involved with and tries to save various little quirky side characters .  in the background rudy's voice narrates his feelings and makes half-cynical jokes about the legal profession in general .  two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be .  first , rudy's time is split juggling three cases , rather than concentrating on a single high-stakes case .  also , rudy's use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some of its dramatic edge .  the end result is an entertaining low key law movie where the good guys win , and rudy narrates his way into coming of age .  |0.6999999999999998|0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|"In summary, the explanations consistently highlight the positive aspects of the movie ""The Rainmaker,"" including its happy ending, the protagonist's attempt to do the right thing, and the entertaining and low-key nature of the film.

1|" "" when will the devil take me ? "" he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over .  the spoiled title character of _onegin_ ( pronounced oh-negg-in ) is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour .  martha fiennes' debut feature is ( quite literally ) filmed poetry ( it's based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin ) , a profound study of regret , of how we confuse shame with guilt .  when we first meet eugene onegin ( ralph , acting for his sister ; another brother , magnus , composed the score ) , a philandering aristocrat from st . petersburg , he has just inherited his uncle's estate .  with plans to sell it , onegin pays a summer visit to the manor , which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside , and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods .  smitten with olga larina ( headey ) , he befriends olga's fianc ? , vladimir lensky ( stephens ) , while olga's sister , tatyana ( tyler ) , romanticizing his flippant attitude ( he's a nineteenth bad boy ) , falls for onegin .  in one sweaty , inky torrent of passion , tatyana writes him a love letter .  he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections , it is implied , because he can .  soon after , tragedy strikes , and onegin makes himself scarce .  when we catch up with him , six years later , he has just returned to st . petersburg , where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend ( donovan ) has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana .  this time , onegin finds her irresistable .  what is most amazing about ralph fiennes' performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch .  overwhelmed by a top hat , the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off , an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past .  the actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there's room to breathe in a role that's made up of shades of gray like "" onegin "" .  petula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in "" parking lot "" : "" you don't know what you've got ? til it's gone . ""  onegin's about-face on tatyana speaks for those of us ( read : most of us ) who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well .  what the character feels is not jealousy but remorse , embarrassment , even , at having let her go .  out of identification we feel empathy for onegin , a callous bastard .  tatyana's emotions echo a thousand ditties , but that makes them no less vital .  she changes , too , from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties .  tyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co-stars , filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares .  they both have faces , mr . fiennes and ms . tyler , capable of conveying archetypal russian misery .  _onegin_ could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of "" masterpiece theater "" , even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact , were martha fiennes not at the helm .  an mtv background ( she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others ) has positively influenced her sense of pace ( though , thankfully , not her shot lengths-no spasmodic cutting here ) ; at just over 100 minutes , _onegin_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair .  the film has an atypical period look , as well .  absent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions .  the sets are almost expressionistically bare , echoing the loneliness of the protagonists .

1|"susan granger's review of "" big eden "" ( jour de fete )  it's utopia , this tiny town tucked away in the timberland of northwestern montana , where old codgers lounge on the porch of the general store to pass the time away and the local matchmakers ( nan martin , louise fletcher ) eagerly pair off the young people , regardless of sexual preference .  there's nary a homophobe or bigot around , much to the surprise of henry hart ( arye gross ) , a successful but lonely manhattan artist who returns home to care for sam ( george coe ) , the ailing grandfather who raised him .  and with the simultaneous re-appearance of his best-friend from high-school and object of his unrequited love ( tim dekay ) , now divorced with two young sons , the fact of his homosexuality must be faced .  to complete the triangle , there's the tall , taciturn native american ( eric schweig ) who owns the general store and lovingly yet secretly prepares gourmet meals for henry and sam .  this fable about home and family is a major debut for first-time film-maker thomas bezucha ( a former designer for coach and polo/ralph lauren ) who is meticulous about minding details , using ballads like "" welcome to my world "" and "" achin' , breakin' heart "" to set up the concept of our universal longing to find a place in which we can love and be loved .  in the paradise of big eden , what you are doesn't matter as much as generosity of spirit , respect and kindness .  sure , the plot's implausible but it's a good-natured fantasy so allowances should be made .  and rob sweeney's photography of glacier national park is spectacular !  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" big eden "" is a charming , quirky , off-beat 7 .  it's a heart-warming romantic comedy about a gay man who doesn't die of aids or wind up alone at the end .

1|it must be tough to be a mob boss .  just ask paul vitti ( robert deniro ) , a man who finds his job as mafia head to be rather stress inducing .  i can believe it , too - one can't even begin to fathom the turmoil he must go through when he's forced to choose between an ice pick , baseball bat or sledgehammer to torture victims with .  suffering from reoccurring panic attacks , paul decides he needs to consult some professional help .  and who better than billy crystal .  after appearing in bottom-of-the-barrel flops , father's day and my giant , crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here .  playing vitti's private shrink , the two very different stars strike an unorthodox , but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish .  casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in-joke , i think .  placed in this mobster's shoes , deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather , part ii and casino .  it's obvious he's having a lot of fun doing so .  the man behind the camera is harold ramis , whose credits include ghostbusters ( as writer and star ) , and his best directing effort , the bill murray vehicle , groundhog day .  ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what's funny , and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors .  the only character who weakens the payoff is crystal's bride-to-be ( lisa kudrow ) .  playing the same dumbed-down role as she does in friends , kudrow is amusing , but doesn't fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped .  the supporting cast sparkles .  joe viterelli is hilarious as jelly , vitti's pea brained right-hand man , and chazz palminteri is a show stopper playing a fellow mobster who's in desperate need of the definition of `closure' .  the movie manages to maintain consistent chuckles throughout , putting the emphasis on 3 or 4 really big laughs that will have audiences grasping their sides .  the situation is just too cute to resist .  it's unfortunate that the language gets somewhat out of hand .  but hey , if you're in the mafia , using obscenities probably comes naturally .  and near the end , seeing billy crystal attempt to walk and talk like a mob boss is truly a special treat .  |0.45|0.8166666666666668|0.86|The overall sentiment of the text is slightly positive, as it highlights the enjoyable comedic aspects and praises the performances of the actors, but also mentions that one character weakens the payoff and the language gets out of hand, slightly lowering the sentiment score.

""  that being said , _the caveman's valentine_ can only really succeed as a heroic fantasy , a frank miller graphic novel that has the audacity to portray the blood staining a field of virgin snow expanding to form the shape of a heart .  the difficulties with the film spring from the misunderstanding that it somehow adheres to the conventions of a thriller or a police procedural when , in fact , _the caveman's valentine_ is a superhero fable that takes on the cause of the homeless ( again like mcfarlane's spawn ) while attacking the entrenched ruling classes in government and the arts .  it is no small detail that our hero , romulus , is not only named for a member of the ruling class who lived his life ( in legend ) without knowledge of his royal birth , but also that our romulus has turned his back on the comforts of the literati in favour of a mystical existence living in a cave in a park . in the romulus mythology , signs of romulus' royal blood is brought by twelve vultures , while in the film , the call to action for our hero comes in the form of not the carrion birds , but of the carrion itself .  whether or not romulus of _the caveman's valentine_ will found a nation , or , in the case of novelist george dawes green , upon whose novel his own screenplay is based , a franchise , the fact remains that _the caveman's valentine_ is easily the most misunderstood film of 2001 thus far .  it , along with m . night shyamalan's _unbreakable_ , is a mature cinematic extrapolation of the graphic novel format which has , since miller's seminal "" the dark knight returns "" , redefined the comic medium as one suitable for mature ruminations on psychologically sticky topics .  readers of sam keith's brilliant "" the maxx "" comic series ( or of mtv's short-lived animated adaptation of the same ) are already familiar with the idea of a homeless man placed in the position of knight errant and king of his own twisted demesne .  the failure of both "" the maxx "" tv show and of _the caveman's valentine_ ( not forgetting the initial backlash against _unbreakable_ ) suggests that the public may not be ready for america's surprising contributions to dark fantasy .  luxuriantly lit , brashly saturated , and comic-panel framed with a virtuoso grace by cinematographer amy vincent ( _death in venice , ca_ ) , while inhabiting robin standefer's ( _practical magic_ ) mesmerizing sets , _the caveman's valentine_ is an unremittingly gorgeous film .  kasi lemmons , following up her brilliant 1997 debut , _eve's bayou_ , which played on similar themes of manufactured realities and mysticism , fulfills much of her immense promise with a tale of seraphs and lost boys , artists and suffering .  _the caveman's valentine_ is an elegant and piquant expression of hope for justice in a tilted landscape .  clearly not for every taste , when approached with the correct paradigm , it is one of the most stunning and intensely fascinating films of the year : a redefinition of the hero archetype for a post-modern audience with urine-stained wool trench coats in place of blue tights and red capes .  _the caveman's valentine_ is a fine and a courageous film , crazy enough to suggest that the delirious yammering of an idiot savant is the best and truest paladin of order in the chaos of eliot's rat's alley wasteland .

1|waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury , joe says : `after all , we're human . '  in the context of events to transpire , joe's line is prophetic , foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film .  does being human necessarily imply humane behavior ?  through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob , fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility .  expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland , lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria .  in the scene prefacing the lynching , the mob achieves critical mass at the bar .  deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant , but when he is unable to augment the mob's myth of joe , he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip .  we see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar .  what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse .  what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless .  to the audience , the deputy's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob's delirium crescendos .  lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera , but rather its stillness .  the shot's composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions .  as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers , it does so around the viewer as well .  the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes , we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality .  because the camera does not track the deputy's movement , we are left with an amplified perception of desertion and vulnerability .  as the bar scene progresses , the camera pans 180 degrees to reveal the fury of the mob .  this shot is unique because it is a point-of-view shot where the audience , not a character in the film is the subject .  while a long , or dolly shot may objectively reveal the size of the mob , panning from the mob's belly distorts the audience's spatial reference and exaggerates the claustrophobia of the scene ; we feel we are at the epicenter of something infinitely large .  we see close shots of people's faces , contorted by their rage .  with the pivot of the pan being in the center of the mob and angry members within a short radius of the pan , lang offers the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be the subject of a lynching .  in this shot the audience is at the mercy of the mob ; lang's camera makes us feel vulnerable and powerless as joe must have felt in the jail .  in some greater sense , it must have been what lang felt when he saw his countrymen overcome with unjustifiable hatred towards their own humankind .  lang's observations of his fellow man succumbing to mob behavior left him with an indelible image of malevolent human behavior .  as joe faces his peril , trapped in his burning cell , his dog rainbow rushes to be by his side .  lang makes rainbow a martyr to contrast his humanity against the recklessness of his human counterparts .  using his camera to create shots that elicit disturbing images of mob mentality , lang depicts man's volatility and `impulse' towards inconceivable cruelty .  reprising joe' s line at the train station , we are induced to question why our primeval impulses so easily transcend our humanity .  |-0.05000000000000001|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|The text has a slightly negative sentiment, evoking discomfort and fear through scenes and events, prompting viewers to question human behavior.

1|"because the press screening of "" planet of the apes "" was one day past last issue's deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece .  the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg's character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked .  to those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ?  this is a tim burton movie , boys and girls .  tim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories .  for the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated "" mars attacks ! ""   ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage "" mars attacks ! ""  trading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up .  burton's re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great .  the apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold .  like astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later .  as for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character .  from his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee-wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack-acking martians , etc . ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes .  so leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders .  as for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back .  he doesn't want to lead humanity and he isn't looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal-rights activist ) .  as a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly .  the surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly isn't nearly as satisfying as the one in the original .  for the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay .  the 1968 "" apes "" boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re-delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending .  but viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball .  the 2001 "" planet of the apes "" offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending .  it also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that's nothing to complain about .
