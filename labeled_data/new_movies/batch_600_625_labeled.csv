1|"review : ghost dog : the way of the samurai ( 1999 )  cast : forest whitaker , henry silva , cliff gorman , john tormey , gene riffini , victor argo , tricia vessey , isaach de bankole' , camille winbush director : jim jarmusch writer : jim jarmusch  rating : good shot ( stars )  languid , yet pointed and focused , ghost dog : the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek , ultra-cool , cinematic image of the hitman .  juxtaposing the samurai's honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/italian mafia , it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor's precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber , dinosaur-like , to function in the modern era .  director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast , ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit .  using a palate of bleached colors , jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film .  he doesn't cater to audience expectations of hyper-colorized , stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies .  the action is presented in flat , brutal codas .  bullets have permanence .  death has consequences .  the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty .  it is an anti-movie , of sorts .  there are few photogenic , empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with .  this isn't a film that lovingly holds your hand .  there are dark , contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder , just so , asserting itself for all to see .  the fulcrum for the movie's thematic balancing act is ghost dog , a mafia hitman .  a twist on the stereotypical image of the mob enforcer , ghost dog is a hilarious contradiction in terms .  unlike the sleek , muscular killing machines one is accustomed to , we are given an inner city black man who is overweight and slovenly , replete with chapped , dirty hands and rumpled clothing .  he wears a hooded sweatshirt , which he often pulls over his head , giving him a monk-like appearance .  there are no acrobatic back flips and shiny super guns in his arsenal .  he uses old , worn weapons and simply goes about his tasks in economical , efficient and pleasureless fashion .  ghost dog is a disciple of the old ways of the samurai , distilling the essence of his life through the filter of a book , which he reads daily , hagakure : the way of the samurai .  life consists of simple pleasures for him : ice cream , warm rooftop naps and good books .  ghost dog lives , as it were , by the basic tenet expressed by his book ; one should start each day considering oneself as dead .  living atop an abandoned building , surrounded by his flock of pet carrier pigeons , ghost dog exists in a netherworld lacking creature comforts and friends .  he craves nothing more .  as he puts it late in the film , "" i've seen all i want to see . ""  he exists in a spiritual world of the mind , gaining moral sustenance from his readings .  ghost dog wasn't always as he is presented .  in several roshomon-like flashbacks , it's shown how ghost dog was assaulted by racist white males and beaten nearly to death until the timely intervention of a good samaritan , that "" samaritan "" being a foot soldier in an aging crime family .  ghost dog pledges his life to the service of the man , louie ( tormey ) , as repayment .  after years of loyal service , ghost dog is sent , by louie , to kill "" handsome frank "" , a made man within louie's organization who has run away with the crime boss's daughter , louise ( vessey ) .  ghost dog wordlessly executes his task , witnessed by louise , whom he spares , as she sits watching a betty boop cartoon , clutching a copy of the book , roshomon .  in a bit of synchronicity , louise loans the book to ghost dog .  upset that frank was taken out by someone not from the family , the mob bosses , in turn , put out a hit on ghost dog in a perverse twist of loyalty to their assassinated comrade .  the rest of movie holds the dated value systems of both the mafia and ghost dog up to the light of a new millennium with many acerbic asides as the two come factions come into conflict .  the theme of old cartoons flares up time and again , each time showing cartoon violence that is in sharp counterpoint to the reality of ghost dog's world .  each time a character is shown watching a cartoon , it's from the same era , betty boop , felix the cat , etc . , a reflection of days gone by .  near the end , louise is watching a cartoon that's a departure from the previously shown ones .  it's a bit of audacity on jarmusch's part that is nicely effective , despite it's surrealistic nature .  as ghost dog floats through his world , his life is touched by two people .  one is a sage little girl ( winbush ) who connects with ghost dog through their love of reading .  she comes to symbolize a melding of the old ways and new sensibilities , just as louise ultimately does .  by film's end , the fact that jamusch is so effective at illustrating the tenuous bond between the two is a testament to his skill as a writer .  the other person in ghost dog's world is an ice cream ( de bankole' ) vendor who only speaks french , yet intuitively shares a rapport with ghost dog .  the vendor is the literal stranger in a strange land .  jarmusch , through rapper/composer rza , underscores his film with rap and reggae music , which at first blush seems dichotomous , but its primal rhythms serve to strengthen the fundamental nature of the movie .  ghost dog seems to draw some type of strength from the rap music he listens to as he negotiates the streets in various stolen cars .   ( which , in and of itself , presents another paradox about ghost's dog's sense of honor . )  the head mafioso is played by henry silva with a stone faced resignation .  of all the cartoonish mobsters , he is the only one who appears self aware of his state in the world .  gorman plays sonny , a lieutenant who respects the old ways , yet has a quirky affinity for rap music , a love comically shown in several impromptu displays .  ruffini seems the truest reflection of the mafia .  he is a husk of a man , assisted by two hearing aids , who barks out advice without truly hearing what he , or others are saying .  whitaker carries the film by using what truly great actor's use , his face .  ghost dog is reticent to speak , often going for long periods without doing so .  the fact that whitaker can convey such a wide range of emotion through a gesture or look is a remarkable talent .  although the film has a deliberate pace , some of the late night drives and walks taken by ghost dog dragged the momentum down .  truly tragic is how ghost dog misinterprets japanese honor in his final confrontation with the mob .  he reveals himself to be so desperate for spiritual guidance through the hagakure that he fails to truly adapt it to what is real and true in his world .  carried on the shoulders of a remarkable performance by whitaker , ghost dog rises beyond being a characterization or icon , into a figure that garners sympathy , if not a bit of pity .

Forest Whitaker's portrayal of the main character is particularly praised, as well as the film's exploration of honor and loyalty and its subversion of mafia and hitman stereotypes. The visuals and music are also noted for creating an effective atmosphere. Some moments in the film are criticized for dragging down the overall momentum."
1|"i rented "" brokedown palace "" last night blind , having heard nothing about it beforehand , and i enjoyed it immensely despite some flaws .  for anyone wishing to have the same experience i would suggest reserving judgement of the movie until viewing it in its entirety .  that is no easy task .  superficially , it bears an unfortunate ( and not necessarily unintended ) resemblance to several other movies , notably "" return to paradise "" and "" midnight express . ""  as a result nearly every review of "" brokedown palace "" i subsequently read became hopelessly entangled in making the obvious comparisons .  the consequence was nearly universal condemnation , which is a shame as this is a fine film .  for those who have yet to view the movie , let me say that it is not an attempt to portray the nightmarish reality of the third world criminal justice system ( as was "" midnight express "" ) nor completely the moral dilemma and examination of the meaning of friendship and humanity that was the heart of "" return to paradise . ""  in my view , if this film is to be compared to any other source it would have to be joseph conrad's acclaimed novel , "" lord jim . ""  problematically , the basic storyline seems more than familiar : two american teenage girls on vacation are sentenced to spend most of their lives in a thai prison for drug smuggling in an obvious set-up involving a suave con-man , a shadowy criminal conspiracy and a corrupt third world "" justice "" system .  the girls are alice ( claire danes ) and darlene ( kate beckinsale ) .  they're life-long buddies who planned a high-school graduation trip to hawaii , and then secretly changed their destination to the more exotic thailand without telling their parents .  once there , they find a $6 hotel and go sight-seeing , which includes sneaking into a luxury hotel to sip expensive drinks poolside .  they get caught trying to charge the bill to the wrong room , a minor transgression which will later come back to haunt them , but they are saved from hotel security by a charming , friendly australian , nick ( daniel lapaine ) , who takes care of the bill with a more polished execution of the girl's scam .  he then proceeds to separate the girls and make smooth moves , first toward alice , then toward darlene .  by now alarm bells are going off among viewers .  the ever-present nick is too slick and his stories don't add up ( to us ) --the girls , of course , are too naive to notice .  long before it happens , we're anticipating the inevitable disappearance of the fast-talking smuggler and the arrest of our teenaged sitting-ducks at the airport en route to hong kong caught holding the bag ( literally ) containing heroin .  just as predictably , the thai police and courts do their part in meting out injustice and our trusting tourists are prison-bound for a long stretch .  left unanswered is the red herring issue of whether one or the other of the girls was a willing accomplice .  for those in need of a ready answer , might i suggest closer scrutiny of the bell hop at the girl's fleabag hotel .  as one door after another to their comfortable former life is closed , the girls and their families turn in desperation to the noiresque expatriate lawyer/fixer "" yankee hank "" ( bill pullam ) and his thai-born partner-wife .  a recurring element of the movie is the tension between appearance and reality as expressed in one of the film's tag lines , "" who do you trust ? , "" and hank is no exception although seasoned movie- goers and those familiar with pullman's oeuvre will find few surprises .  much of the remainder of the movie is a smorgasbord of intriguing themes incompletely explored in short-hand fashion .  lou diamond phillips , for instance , plays a delightfully sinister and callous dea agent who , while appearing to be casually accommodating to hank , withholds vital information at crucial moments .  is he part of a wider conspiracy ?  with an inherently powerful , if somewhat tired premise , the film offers by parts a riveting courtroom drama , a prison story , and a potential character study of american teens , their relationship , and what constitutes friendship between them .  the result is reasonably engaging and suspenseful , with the girls' interaction , hank's investigation , and the various trials and hearings , offering hope for their release , delivering tension--as does the foredoomed possibility of their escape .  if "" brokedown palace "" has a major flaw , it is its creators' tendency , like time-constrained tourists , to take frequent side trips down fascinating alleys only to reverse direction half-way down and return to the story's main avenue .  and , if that were all there was to "" brokedown palace , "" it wouldn't be a very good movie .  but i believe the writers and director were after bigger game and , in this , they succeeded .  for the main theme of the movie , like the proffered name of its location , is freedom--in all its permutations .  ultimately , the other sub-themes may be considered window dressing .  young and pretty , alice ( danes ) is an old soul ; a wild , streetwise teenager with a thirst for freedom and adventure .  presented as a perfect blend of yin and yang , dark and light , is her cautious best friend , darlene ( beckinsale ) .  clear-eyed and straightforward , alice is more complex than her friend .  she comes from a poorer background , has a reputation for getting into trouble and has lost the trust of everyone ( including her own father ) .  whereas darlene's life is "" on-track , "" aimed at college , marriage , kids , a career , a suburban home , middle age and "" fulfillment , "" alice's is uncertain , unfocused , and yearning .  one poignant scene in the film shows darlene shouting across an open moat to visitors--friends and relatives from home , whose lives continue while hers is in limbo .  tellingly , alice is present but not included .  just as revealing of their different personalities , when alice and dar first come to thailand , the openness and delight on alice's face doesn't read as simple naivet ? ; the way she stands up and stretches as she and her friend ride along in a small boat , reaching toward the sun , she really is drinking in what she believes to be freedom , while "" dar "" remains seated in the shade .   "" brokedown palace "" begins with an admission by alice of her guilt in a tape recording sent to hank .  however unintentional , it's all alice's fault .  she's responsible for persuading her friend to lie to her parents , to sneak away from the safety of hawaii to the perils of thailand , to try the petty scam which places them in the clutches of the evil nick .   ( in case one misses this point in the inevitable confusion of a film's beginning , darlene obligingly reminds alice of her culpability in prison . )  dar , of course , is the willing dupe which , in her view , confers innocence .  never mind that it was her coercion of a reluctant alice to accompany her to hong kong which placed them in police custody in the first place or that her naive confession sealed their fate .  dar is innocent .  it doesn't matter .  alice is the subject of this movie .  she and her journey toward personal freedom .  along the way we are treated to an unsympathetic portrait of the shallow american culture which created these girls with their half-baked sensibilities and materialistic goals .  in the end , that culture , like its representatives , "" yankee "" hank and dar's father ( a "" man who knows how to grease the wheels "" ) , proves as impotent as its government in the face of the girl's tragedy .  thailand's culture , contrary to most opinion , comes off much better by comparison .  it amazes me that reviewers argued this point at both extremes .  i believe the filmmaker's view was that thai culture is vastly different from the american but not necessarily inferior .  the thai ( with the sole exceptions of a corrupt official and a spiteful prison spy ) were uniformly consistent in their behavior and true to their principles .  the girls were shown to be treated no better but certainly no worse than the native-born .  their prison ( in stark contrast to the probable reality ) was no hellhole , being relatively clean and sunlit .  the prison authorities demanded good hygiene , provided medical care when needed , and "" hard manual labor "" consisted of picking grass !  the thai guards were authoritarian ( what else ? ) but certainly not routinely sadistic .  as for the thai justice system , the reasoning of the thai judges , during both an appeal hearing and in the film's penultimate scene was devastating in its logic and morality .  'freedom' has many faces and "" brokedown palace "" explores many of them .  in the extreme , we have freedom of the body and freedom of the spirit .  some settle for the former alone while others remain imprisoned with an entire nation to roam without the latter .  but freedom seldom comes without a price .  which is why the movie's other tag lines are : "" what is your dream ? ""  and "" how far would you go ? ""  i believe i could make a good case for the interpretation that the person who attains freedom , incarcerated or not , by film's end is alice .  she finds redemption and salvation through the acceptance of personal responsibility .  i think the light bathing only her figure among the assembled prisoners in the final scene visually signals that fact .  kate beckinsale's character might more properly be likened to the "" released "" temple bird referred to twice during the film , "" trained to fly back to its cage . ""  as the thai magistrate observed in the film's climactic scene , the issue was always one of "" character ; "" and the jamaican prisoner made it clear that "" freedom "" is achieved within oneself .  if one thinks back over the movie , which character was transformed by their experiences ?  increasingly , the cinema landscape seems to have become littered with endless permutations of 'kung fu woman'--female characters virtually indistinguishable from male action figures .  here , at last , is the story of a modern heroine .  in reading the many user's comments , i was struck by what seems an unusual phenomenon : whether or not a person liked the movie , almost everyone praised the actors .  think about that .  when was the last time you came away from a motion picture possibly hating it , but raving about all the performances in it ?  do yourself a favor : rent "" brokedown palace "" and watch it with a open mind .  there's more there than meets the eye .

1|"everyone's heard about this movie , and more specifically , * the * scene .  everyone's heard the famous barnyard animal quote squealed ( no pun intended ) over and over .  and everyone's got to admit that they will never travel down a river again without thinking of deliverance .  good !  that's what you're supposed to do !  oh , if you are one of the ones who hasn't seen this yet , or you ( somehow ) haven't heard about what happens , here's your spoiler warning .  deliverance was a real shocker for it's time ( 1972 ) .  major advances were being made in films , and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry .  when it was first released , it literally shocked the audiences .  it was something that , for the most part , had really never been seen on the big screen before ( among wide-release films with an r rating ) .  but by today's film standards and in today's world , such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that isn't as shocking , although they can be even more graphic ( e . g .  pulp fiction ) .  pulp fiction did it in a way , and expanded on it in a way , that it could even be interpreted as funny .  but in 1972 , deliverance was no laughing matter .  the story centers around a group of four atlanta men who decide to take a rafting trip down a backwoods river in georgia while the river is still there and in its glory .  the initial leader of the group is lewis ( burt reynolds in his prime ) , a real outdoorsman and more of a daniel boone-type then any of the others .  joining him are ed ( jon voight ) , bobby ( ned beatty ) , and drew ( ronny cox ) .  the group's first objective is to find someone ( s ) to drive their cars down the river to the point where they will end their trip .  they make arrangements with a few mountain men , who accept $40 . 00 for the task .  drew also has the famous "" dueling banjos "" competition with a local who is , let us say , genetically challenged .  the men then set off down the river , with lewis , also the master at canoeing , leading the way .  everything seems to be going fine , until the two canoes split up , leaving the unexperienced ed and bobby alone .  they encounter two hillbillies , armed with a shotgun , who captured them .  ed is tied to a tree while bobby is sodomized by one of the men .  ed nearly receives the same cruelty , but lewis arrives just in time to fire an arrow through the rapist's back .  the other hillbilly gets away , and the men have to decide what to do with the dead body .  disposing of dead bodies is done rather frequent throughout this film .  while attempting to make a quick "" paddle for it "" , both canoes tip over .  drew , who was without a life jacket , was possibly shot and cannot be found .  lewis suffered a rather nasty compound fracture during the incident and is in serious condition .  this leaves ed and bobby .  ed decides to go out and look for the remaining hillbilly , alone , with the bow and arrow .  the question arises if he will be able to handle himself , as he horribly botched a first shot attempt at a deer , to which his comment "" i wonder how anyone could kill a living thing "" will have more meaning in the future .  deliverance is definitely a wild ride ( oops , i'm doing it again ) .  it is extremely tense at some points and very dramatic .  it's definitely one of those "" must see "" movies and should be considered one of the classics of its decade .

1|"in october of 1997 , audiences were dazzled by the horror surprise hit i know what you did last summer .  the film went on to gross over 70 million dollars in the u . s . , and even developed a cult following , much like the previous year's 100 million dollar grossing scream .  when the trailer hit theaters in september attached to urban legend , it looked like a wonderful follow-up .  did it live up to the first film ?  the answer is no .  jennifer love hewitt returns as julie james , a survivor of the serial killer that attempted to kill her and her friends a year before .  she has been so upset since the incident .  nightmares haunt her all over the place , but she has to move on .  she know attends college , and is best friends with a funny , outgoing girl named karla ( brandy ) , who is trying to hook julie up with will benson , played by newcomer matthew settle .  karla's boyfriend is tyrell , the funny , outgoing type , who is played by soul food's mekhi phifer .  freddie prinze jr . also returns as ray , julie's boyfriend from a year ago .  one morning , julie and karla are called up by a local radio station who are offering four tickets to the bahamas if they can correctly identify the capital of brazil .  of course , they answer it correctly , and they are off to the bahamas .  julie wants ray to come , but he declines the offer , so karla secretly invites will instead to help boost her plan of hooking him up with julie .  after they arrive at their hotel , it is just them and the staff on the island .  it starts off as the weekend of their dreams .  something just had to come to mess up the one care-free weekend of julie's life though .  ben willis ( muse watson ) is back , and he isn't letting anyone survive this time .  will ray come to the rescue before he can kill them off one by one ?  jennifer love hewitt and brandy turn in respectable performances .  brandy in particular was impressive , considering this is her first feature film .  you could see that the characters were horrified , and they would do anything possible to survive .  matthew settle and freddie prinze jr . are a completely different story .  let's start with settle .  matthew is completely fake in this film .  you could not believe a word coming out of his mouth .  you could tell he was acting , and its reasons like him that this one isn't as good as the first one .  he does do a good job towards the end , but that doesn't clear up the scars he already left on the film .  freddie prinze jr . is almost as bad as matthew settle was .  he is almost completely unbelievable , and the majority of his lines are completely meaningless and out of place .  we don't see him as much as settle , otherwise he could have done just as much damage as settle did .  mekhi phifer is alright as tyrell , but yet again the dialogue is out of place .  the plot of i still know turns out to be a pretty good one at the end of the movie .  i like where the filmmakers went with this second installment , but maybe if it occurred in the same town as the first one , it would have been a bit better .  the cinematography and setting of their island are simply wonderful .  there are a lot of very nice shots around their hotel .  the sound is pretty good , but still not as creepy as the first film's .  jennifer love hewitt's song , "" how do i deal "" is also played for about thirty seconds .  i still know what you did last summer is nothing compared to the first film .  the first film was very suspenseful , and it contained some very memorable scenes .  the last fifteen minutes of i still know what you did last summer really picked up , and almost reached the same level as the first film .  before this part in the film , there are many unnecessary deaths and fake scares .  that is okay though , because the film is still very much fun and there are a few suspenseful scenes .  i think the reason this film wasn't as scary as the original was because in the first one , the killer terrorized the people involved in the incident .  he made them suffer for what they did .  in the second film , ben willis just kills anyone he feels like .  he doesn't stick with ray and julie , who were the ones he is actually after .  he had to go after karla , will , and tyrell .  if the characters he stalked were in some relation to the incident that went on when he was ran over by julie , ray , helen , and barry , it could have been much better , and it would have made a lot more sense .  the bottom line- not a disappointment , but a third in the series would be out of hand .

1|"brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly .  since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames .  consequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito's way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes .  it doesn't hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn .  carlito's way , while hampered by depalma's characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama .  carlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance .  in 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality .  he declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas .  among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito's crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) .  carlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace .  old ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can't seem to shake .  carlito's way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film .  in the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station .  both highlight depalma's gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely .  yet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling .  carlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit .  but where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there's more of an immediacy to carlito's way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion .  you sense that there's no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble .  indeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : "" you don't get reformed ; you just run out of wind . ""  pacino captures carlito's dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy .  sean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld .  a jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder .  he could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct .  he shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting .  as compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu .  depalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas .  he even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables .  from a story standpoint , there's an obligatory love story with a cliche'd long-suffering girlfriend character .  penelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn't do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story .  still , it's easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid .  the two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn't break .  carlito's way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful .  those willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded .

1|"i've never been a huge fan of jeff bridges , but i loved him in the big lebowski .  the part of jeff "" the dude "" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind , and the fit is perfect .  the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles , a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians .  he's enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes .  after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy , but not before they urinate on his rug .  the dude assumes that these "" collection agents "" were after another jeff lebowski , a famous millionaire who also lives in l . a . so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug .  the millionaire refuses , but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped .  he wants the dude to act as go-between for the kidnapers .  dude and his friend walter ( john goodman ) take on the task , and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers , millionaires , high schoolers , nihilists , artists , pornographers , thugs , and league bowlers .  comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres , so take my recommendation as you will : for me , the big lebowski is very funny .  it is an incredibly successful comedy , the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films .  not only are the two leads ( bridges and goodman ) funny separately and together , but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure .  all the characters end up as the butt of jokes , but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived .  each person may be a comic caricature , but there is always a respectful self-acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension .  the characters are firmly established , and they never change their behavior for a quick , cheap laugh .  it's not what they do that's funny , it's who they are , which is why the acting is so important , and so successful , in this movie .  worth mentioning are john turturro as jesus ( that's jee-zus , not hay-soos ) , the greaser bowler who's in a lusty marriage with the game ; julianne moore as the post-post-feminist artist whose work has been described as "" vaginal ; "" steve buscemi as the eager tagalong bowler who is constantly rebuked and ignored by teammates dude and walter ; and sam elliott as the rambling , long-winded narrator .  aside from the performances , what makes all the characters funny and interesting is the astute dialogue .  people lose trains of thought , they interrupt , they boast , they repeat themselves , they repeat their friends . . .  they sound natural .  taken with fargo , the coen brothers' last film , it is evidence that the brothers are observant listeners and gifted writers .  ethan coen is not just good at directing actors , he's also good at technical directing .  he and cinematographr roger deakins created a beautiful world on film .  perhaps "" beautiful "" is the wrong word ; nihilists , carpet-pissers and thugs are not objects of beauty .  but the bowling photography and a series of viking/bowling fantasy dream sequences are lovingly photographed , as though the dude himself were in charge of immortalizing them on film .  all around , the big lebowski is great , solid comedy .  outstanding acting , writing , direction and photography all combine to make this a great comic success .

1|"synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru'afro .  the enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts .  comments : "" star trek : the next generation "" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to "" star trek , "" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s .  even though it still enjoyed high ratings , "" star trek : the next generation "" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original "" star trek "" 's cast in paramount's film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise .  star trek : insurrection is the ninth "" star trek "" movie and the third to focus on the "" star trek : the next generation "" crew .  star trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between "" okay "" and "" good . ""  after star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant "" star trek : voyager "" tv series , "" star trek "" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise .  i don't wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies .  most people reading this probably haven't followed "" star trek "" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best .  let me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it's out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection's comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie .  okay . let's move to the movie itself .  star trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity's exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners .  this combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy .  much of this film appeals to trek fans' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise's crew .  audiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times .  star trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba'ku homeworld .  forget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show .  this tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son'a .  it seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state .  the enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data's actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba'ku and plunder the planet's youth-restoring properties .  sound pretty heavy ?  it is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film's constant barrage of humor .  when going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) .  in a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at .  the acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good .  since they've been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough .  the terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard's trademark , with his usual aplomb .  brent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) .  the supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good .  despite many other critics' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru'afro well enough .  ru'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune .  like the baron , ru'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants .  in one particularly memorable scene , ru'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds .  ru'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations .   ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . )  donna murphy must also be noted as a ba'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with .  murphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance .  this is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with .  in fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here .  a particular plot point involving anij's ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie .  for as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection's special effects were surprisingly disappointing .  they proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) .  the space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite .  the new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn't look quite right for a reason i cannot explain .  despite star trek : insurrection's frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film .  it maintains roddenberry's largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don't get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) .  i'd recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general .  rated pg , i can't see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old .

1|"us critic-type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies aren't thrill rides , but i think that "" back to the future ii "" is one of the few exceptions .  if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s , then this has the spirit of the 80s : full of fights ; chase scenes ; cliff hangers ; special effects ; some detective work ; and of course the vision of the high-tech future .  the film picks up exactly where the first film left off , with doc ( lloyd ) , marty ( fox ) , and jennifer ( elizabeth shue ) travelling 30 years into the future , because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifer's kids .  doc tells marty he must take his son's place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr . says yes to griff ( wilson - in one of four different roles ) .  whoever said history tends to repeat itself wasn't joking , especially when it comes to the movies .  essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015 , but it's not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself .  at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better , and it seems like everything's copasetic right ?  wrong .  since when do things go according to plan in the "" back to the future "" movies ?  there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i won't even bother to list them all .  basically we get to see marty as an old man , his house , his family , etc . we also go back to an alternate 1985 , and then back again to 1955 , with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath .  the films' best aspect is the fact that it actually goes back to the first movie and shows a lot of the action that occurred from another angle .  it's difficult to convey the sense of wild and zany fun without describing every little detail .  the only thing sacrificed in this film is the suspense .  instead of a grand finale , we get lots of little victories .  by the end everything is back to normal , but something happens that leads to yet another sequel , but it doesn't seem gratuitous .   "" back to the future part ii "" is a really great adventure movie .  it certainly has more originality than other films but it lacks a certain charm that was dominate throughout its predecessor .

1|"magnolia left me relling from the theatre , staggering from the relentless assault of an adventurous director reveling in his craft .  at nearly three and a half hours , magnolia will strike some as a brute of a film .  it not only demands your attention , but challenges you to grasp the significance of seemingly unrelated storylines and hidden intentions .  it is delirious , depressing , heady , pretentious , surreal filmmaking .  it's also a movie that will polarize its viewers .  director paul thomas anderson takes a talented cast , wraps them in a net of interrelated stories and sets them spinning in a symphony of despair whose song doesn't let up until an oddly exhilerating , biblically influenced pseudo-climax .  the character's make up a modern day gomorrah in the soulless way in which they live their lives .  there is frank mackey ( tom cruise ) , a slithery snake charmer of men whose "" search and destroy "" seminars teach how to mentally rape a woman to get into her pants .  there is earl partridge ( jason robards ) , a dying media tycoon yearning to make amends for a lfe of callousness by finding his estranged son .  there is game show host jimmy gator ( phillip baker hall ) , a self absorbed tv icon who is hiding more than a few secrets from his public .  and there is police officer jim kurring ( john c . reilly ) , who cloaks himself in the codification of organized religion and the legal system , perhaps masking a man who needs rules to fuel his decision making process .  given equal weight are stories involving a coke-addled emotional cripple ( melora walters ) , a former tv quiz show champion ( william h . macy ) .  a materialistic , adulterous wife ( julianne moore ) , a child ( jeremy blackman ) victimized by a mentally abusive parent , and a caring , empathetic nurse ( philip seymour hoffman ) .  hovering over all these characters is a cloud of death , lies and despair .  it is not a pleasant movie .  there is not one bad note in the acting .  it is affecting and layered and wonderful .  there is a moment where tom cruise wordlessly implodes that rivals work he has done in whole films .  then he tops himself with a mesmerizing deathbed scene .  walters plays her character with red-eyed rawness and a fierce self-destructiveness that is anxiety inducing .  robards convincingly portrays a fading whisper of a man , who still hears a lion's roar when he speaks .  director anderson has apparently given the actors lattitude to emote .  the problem is that he stays on them too long .  julianne moore's character , linda , quickly escalates to a frenzied pitch of guilt , tears , screaming and remorse and never backs off from it .  after a few hours , it turns from interesting to chinese water torture .  quite a few scenes , such as the game show , go on just a bit too long and will be off-putting for those used to a pat 90 minute film where the main theme is reiterated several times just in case you missed it the first go around .  and just what is the theme ?  alienation ?  hopelessness ?  anderson challenges you to draw your own conclusions and he doesn't make it easy .  the film starts by showing three , strange and seemingly unrelated events .  it's a harbinger of the synchronicity to come .  at times , different stories reach reach key moments at the same time .  other times , stories seem to veer off into uncharted territory , regardless of what else is happening .  anderson is audacious enough to even have a group sing in the middle of the film !  what's surprising is that it mostly works .  if you have doubts about anderson's intentions , i'll ask you to pay attention to the final frame .  despite all the sturm und drang , magnolia ultimately speaks to man's capacity for hope and attempts at redemption .  despite magnolia's needlessly long running time and its propensity for uneven editing as anderson plays the auteur , showing off fro the masses , i have to admire his guts .  this is truly adventurous filmmaking that spits in the face of conventional storytelling .  my rating : a bulleye .   ( stars )  a side note : helping anchor the film is a perfectly matched soundtrack featuring aimee mann .  her lyrics often add depth to a scene thematically while the actual music is both morose and beautiful .  when she sings "" save me "" at the end , it enhances the yearning felt by the characters , just as "" wise up "" mirrors the anguish felt by all as they contemplate their lives .

1|"a group of high school kids mix up with a group of hip-hop artists as a documentarian strives to discover why today's youth seem attracted to black culture .  the review  if black & white , the new film from writer/director james toback , is eventually remembered for only one thing , it will be the revelation that brooke shields , claudia schiffer , marla maples and mike tyson can act .  however , this partly improvised gem will be remembered for more than that .  black & white is a fascinating film ; it makes a statement about america's youth and hip-hop culture without getting heavy-handed overly serious .  featuring a cast of known commodities ( ben stiller , robert downey jr . ) and hot newcomers ( singers bijou phillips ) , toback's is a complex film worth seeing .  black & white has multiple storylines that are all related to each other , a la robert altman .  there is dean the basketball player ( allan houston ) who is asked to rig games for money by mark clear ( stiller ) in exchange for fifty grand a game .  this eventually spills over into the life of dean's long-time friend rich ( power ) , a gangsta who controls 20 city blocks of harlem .  rich has to deal with the imminent opening of a white-owned club on his turf .  meanwhile , the young white girls who like to hang around with rich and his homies get talked into being in a documentary by sam donager ( shields ) and her gay husband terry ( downey jr . ) .  others who make appearances are william lee scott as the young white punk will , joe pantoliano as his district attorney father , jared leto as a high school teacher , marla maples as the mother of one of hip-hop crazed teens , claudia schiffer as dean's girlfriend , and mike tyson as . . .  mike tyson .  the stories ebb and flow through the film , losing and gaining prominence over time .  friendships are lost , lovers are gained , and there is an occasional burst of violence .  originally rated nc-17 in the united states , black & white features a lot of sex between black gangstas and young white girls .  while the film was trimmed down to a tamer r rating , viewers will wonder what could be more explicit than what they are seeing .  the three-way sexual beginning of the film nicely warns viewers of what they are in for , and several audience members got up and left at that point .  the frequent sex is one of the film's few flaws as the titillation is overdone and at times completely unrelated to anything else going on in the film .  to toback's credit , the level of violence in black & white is almost nil .  these gangstas and hip-hop artists are given real problems and concerns , and only become gun-toting crazies when it benefits them to appear that way .  whenever a character finds himself on donager's handheld digital camera , he starts spouting off righteous tirades on america and proclaims his independence , but not everyone has fully bought into the idea .  charlie ( phillips ) is full of bluster about why she loves hip-hop , but admits that "" in ten years time , i'll be way over this . ""  these youth know they are going through a phase , and are simply enjoying it .  toback fills the spaces between these tirades with scenes that are lightweight and funny .  most of the humour comes from mike tyson , who provides the film's comic relief without really trying .  he is given big words like vernacular to say , and as rich tries to discuss a particular street problem with tyson , he frequently has to ask him to use smaller words and explain himself better , playing on tyson's image as a dimwit .  but tyson also gets the film's scariest moment .  as he is mercilessly hit upon by the very gay terry , tyson is a marvel to watch as he fights to remain calm .  the scene is entirely improvised , with downey jr . being told to just keep at tyson until he gets a reaction .  the reaction he gets , being slapped and then choked is astonishing , as downey jr's face turns a frightening shade of purple .  black & white is a film about hip-hop culture , and the film's omnipresent hip-hop soundtrack strongly supports this .  but toback keeps things from becoming too serious ; by moving from story to story as quickly as he does , toback keeps us from becoming attached to any one character's struggle .  thus black & white's message about hip-hop becomes secondary to the film itself .  toback just wants us to have fun and maybe learn a little about hip-hop along the way .  and we do .

1|john carpenter directed this stylish and gory vampire flick to which has it's good side and it's bad .  it's held up by some good performances and dazzling special effects leading up to an ending that's pretty satisfying .  james woods gives an outstanding performance that almost covers up the movie .  the good side : some neat scenes of vampires and violence .  the bad : no scares .  yes that's right , even though being directed by one of horror's most cherished directors , 'vampires' is the least bit scary , if not at all .  james woods stars as jack a vampire hunter out to stop the plans of the 'master' vampire valek played by thomas ian griffith whom wants vampires to walk in the daylight .  daniel baldwin plays his sidekick montoya , a wise-cracking guy who really isn't that funny .  in the opening scene jack along with montoya and the team of vampire hunters , find an abandoned house to which vampire occupy .  of course we all know sunshine kills vampires , and that is just how they kill these vampires : hooking them to ropes and dragging them outside letting them burn to death .  after throwing a party for what happened , the vampires that did not die come back to trash it .  they kill almost all of jack's team , leaving only a few alive .  sheryl lee plays a prostitute katrina who was bitten by valek , but not yet turned into a vampire .  she is rescued by jack and ? flees with them on their search for valek .  they have to fight they're way against vampires , leading up to a finale that is well-done with great special effects .  'vampires' definately could have been done better .  the make-up , special effects and story are first rate , but there is no scares or terror that the film could have had .  it to me had more humor than horror , almost being compared to 'fright night' with the mix of violence and comedy .  john carpenter does a great job of directing this film .  he eases through some tough times and saves the flaws , which are noticeable but forgettable .  the script is clever and funny , with many lines that make us laugh out loud .  i much enjoyed 'vampires' with a few exceptions .  it's one of those films you see but don't take to heart .  you enjoy the time you spent and go on .  the recently released 'psycho' is the same way , it's not as good as you'd hope but it is fun and entertaining .

1|"in the wake of the smashing success of "" rumble in the bronx , "" it's looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release .  rumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii .  the version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it's widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days .  availability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng .  the subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small .  although the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you're reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it .  to be fair , i must admit that i've never been very fond of "" period-piece "" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past .  perhaps it's because most of those i've seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it's because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant .  in fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end .  or , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts .  having said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i've seen , and i quite enjoyed it .  surprised ?  well , so was i .  drunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu .  where he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong's practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu .  apparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i've heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i'll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better .  one of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the "" once upon a time in china "" movies , but i have not yet seen those .  the plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you're watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren't expecting something on the order of "" war and peace "" .  the story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china's cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill .  however , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong's perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs .  the macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners .  in the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer .  in the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng .  after fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general's son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng .  and so it goes .  and the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong's girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i've already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves .  let's move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the  action .  there's plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of  course , in a kung fu film , that's to be expected .  however , this isn't just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius .  the primary martial arts "" style "" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk .  further , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but  there's a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor .  under normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair .  the kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i'll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching .  another thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work .  even without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film .  among other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) .   ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . )  unlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked .  drunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( "" a better tomorrow "" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the "" heroic trio "" series , "" rumble in the bronx "" ) .  the performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film .  the scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong's father's back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong's mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband's anger away from fei-hong ) .  jackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he's in fine form all through drunken master ii .  as far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film .  it's nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s .  the picture is crisp and clear .  one thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i've ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below .   ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . )  it will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release .  drunken master ii shows the full potential of "" period piece "" kung fu movies , and it's good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies .  the plot does meander a bit , but that's to be expected in this type of film .  if you like this kind of movie , you'll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway .  if nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental .

1|at first glance , three kings looks to be just another war movie , the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember .  the 90s version , it definitely is , just another war movie ?  not in your dreams !  imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan , thats three kings for you .  believe it or not , it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter .  the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war , with the allied troops victorious .  majpr archie gates ( clooney ) leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post-war looting spree ; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert .  as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home , this `wild bunch goes awol on an armed hum-vee ( the vehicle of choice of the us army ) .  they soon find out that they have much resistance , as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces .  frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men , they become consciously attacked by their own morals .  as the film begins to roll , it seemed to have a rather `light mood to it .  `special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie .  three kings is much smarter than that .  as the conflict becomes more and more complex , the audience will be trapped in a limbo , trying to stay focussed on that light-mood/serious-mood that the film seem to portray .  i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film ; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity .  this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant .  action sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs in-your-face war violence .  they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses , right before the action starts .  not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style ( tons of them starring clint eastwood ) .  great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film ; the screenwriter and the director .  three kings ranks among the best films of the year , well , for me at least .  highly recommended .  |0.5433333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|The movie is praised for its unique combination of genres, complex conflict, carefully crafted action sequences, and brilliant storytelling, resulting in an overall positive sentiment, although there may be some mixed feelings.
1|"mickey mouse had better watch his back -- there's a new critter in town , and he's the nameless animal attraction of "" mouse hunt , "" dreamworks skg's clever first foray into family fare .  although it runs out of steam towards its end , this live-action comedy still boasts enough energized slapstick and inventive set pieces to best disney's entire 1997 non-animated , kiddie-oriented catalog . . .  but consider that list includes dismal tripe like "" air bud , "" "" flubber "" and "" that darn cat , "" and it's really not such a difficult feat to pull off .  still , throw the two rodents in a boxing arena , and i'll be hoping that the mouse from "" mouse hunt "" knocks some sense back into mickey .  nathan lane ( robin williams' significant other from "" the birdcage "" ) and lee evans ( last seen as a nervous bellhop in "" the fifth element "" ) play ernie and lars smuntz , befuddled brothers who have just inherited two unwanted assets from their late father ( william hickey , in his last role ) -- a dilapidated old string factory and a dilapidated old mansion .  although lars made a deathbed promise to upkeep the former , he and ernie decide to sell the latter for big bucks after learning it was designed by a famed architect .  but there's a lone obstacle in their way -- a single mouse lives within the walls of the house , and he's not about to give up his place of residence without a fight .  movies aimed at young audiences are rarely this visually exquisite .  the effects blending the talents of 60-some live mice , one animatronic mouse and one computer-generated mouse are pretty seamless .  the splendid production design seems to be straight out of tim burton's mind ; the smuntz's architecturally-unsound mansion is like something straight out of "" the nightmare before christmas , "" and the vortex of bizarre machinery in their factory resembles some of vincent price's warped contraptions from "" edward scissorhands . ""   "" mouse hunt "" is a pretty dark movie -- even some of the humor can be grim -- but it's hardly ever mean-spirited .  the star of the show is neither the top-billed lane nor the titular mouse .  it's lanky british comedian evans , whose hysterical bodily antics suggest a cleaned-up jim carrey without the obnoxious overkill ( note a toned-down but nonetheless outrageous impromptu striptease ) ; evans' banter with the ever-affable lane is funny stuff , too , and holds its own against the movie's more flashy physical shtick .  vicki lewis ( beth from "" newsradio "" ) is solid in a supporting role as lars' money-grubbing wife .  and in a nifty bit of novelty casting , christopher walken is a macabre delight as a spooky exterminator who takes his job a little too seriously , popping a dropping into his mouth and noting to his tape recorder that the mouse has a "" calcium deficiency . ""  blech .  a basically one-joke idea -- a mouse outsmarts a couple of bumbling humans -- is given a rather engaging execution .  their sparring is imaginatively realized ( i don't think i'll ever forget the sight of that tiny little mouse making his getaway on a rolling wheel of gouda ) , and although you really never fully root for either side , that's okay -- a warm-and-fuzzy union between the two parties is practically promised from the first frame they share .   "" mouse hunt "" may take a while to get going ( the rather lengthy set-up could test the patience of some of the younger children , although i rather liked it , much in part to lane and evans ) , and the climactic sequence is allowed to play out for a bit too long , but this appears to be one family movie that most members of the family will be able to find agreeable , not unlike the original "" home alone .

1|a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings .  a prime example of this is 1999's 10 things i hate about you , which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school .  less successful was last year's adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp . here the setting was the corporate world of new york .  now comes o , a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare's tragedies .  like 10 things i hate about you , the stage is a high school - a private prep school where odin james ( mekhi phifer ) is the on-court general , the basketball team's standout player .  julia stiles , featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke's hamlet , plays desi brable , odin's girlfriend , whose father also happens to be dean of the institution .  josh hartnett ( pearl harbor ) is on hand for the villainy , playing the scheming hugo , who sets the tragic wheels in motion .  o was actually filmed a couple of years ago , but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy .  the movie , directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother , where art thou ?  - and written by brad kaaya , is very grim .  an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits .  and that is how it should be .  of all of shakespeare's tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery .  kaaya's profane-filled script - after all , these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts .  the young man considers himself the basketball team's prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass , shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin .  plus his father , the team's coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood .  the script follows the familiar lines of the classic .  hugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi's fidelity , eroding the star's confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game .  it all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved .  the performances in o vary .  phifer is at first cocky and self-assured , emotions he handles with ease .  he also does quite well displaying odin's darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution , his growing distrust of those he loved , his rage and the erosion of his belief system .  hartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit , turning friend against friend , and lover against lover .  stiles seems a bit stilted , but occasionally also rises to the occasion , moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight .  the film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo's theft of the school mascot is left hanging .  also desi's actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) , odin's former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo's machinations , is puzzling .  why she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back .  it is irrational .  but these are minor carpings .  overall , o is a stylish and faithful adaptation .  if nothing else , it may encourage some people to read the original text , and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature .  |0.44166666666666665|0.8500000000000001|0.7166666666666667|"The overall sentiment of the text is slightly positive due to the positive mention of making Shakespeare more accessible to younger audiences and the praise for the film ""O,"" despite some negative points mentioned such as the grim and tragic nature of the film."

1|"director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days ( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one ) .  film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story , but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something .  but most directors seem to go for action with the slightest ounce of a story .  so whenever a director uses the camera to its fullest potential , the film almost automatically deserves a good review .  and when they add a fascinating story to it , you have nearly perfect entertainment .  fincher's the game is no exception to this .  the game is one of the most interesting and complex films to come out of hollywood in a long time .  fincher hasn't made a film since "" seven , "" his box office and critical hit which defied expectations and became one of the best movies ever .  so it is about time he made another film .  and what a ride it is .  the game isn't quite as powerful as "" seven , "" but in some ways it is better .  overall , the game could have used a little more clarity , or a little more uncertainty .  it walks a line of insanity and reality , but it never goes either way until the very end .  the outcome is satisfying enough for the preceding events , and it makes a lot of sense once everything is set straight .  unfortunately , unlike "" the usual suspects , "" we are never given enough information to figure out for ourselves what is happening , whether it be true or false .  however , this also gives the film a frightening aspect which the game uses to the fullest extent .  the game is told completely from its main character's point of view .  nicholas van orton ( michael douglas ) is a high-strung and isolated businessman .  he lives alone in his giant mansion , divorced from his wife elizabeth , and is celebrating his 48th birthday ; the same age at which his father committed suicide at , in the same mansion .  for his 48th birthday , conrad ( sean penn ) , the rebel of the family , gives nicholas a gift certificate to crs : consumer recreation services .   "" it will make your life fun again , "" his brother promises .  as skeptical as nicholas is , he is somewhat intrigued , and annoyed by the lack of information--something this businessman hates .  seeing a billboard in an office , he decides to visit the mysterious company .  jim feingold ( james rebhorn ) greets nicholas and guides him through the sign-up process , which consists of psych-tests , physicals , emotional responses , and other mind games .   "" each game is suited to each person's emotional and psychological needs , "" explains feingold .  one day , nicholas gets a call from crs and they explain that he failed the tests .  even more intrigued and now somewhat angered at the time he spent signing up , he starts asking around to see what people can tell him about the company .  what he doesn't realize is that the game has already begun .  the phone call is just the first of many strange events to be thrown nicholas' way .  how he finds out that he is involved has to be witnessed because it is amusing and fun and visually impressive .  the detail involved in fincher's shots is incredible and almost requires a second viewing just to appreciate the effort that went into them .  with "" seven , "" fincher had almost every single shot mean something .  he also has the unique ability to make you look at exactly what he wants you to .  compared to "" seven , "" though , the game is light and comical .  because of this film's sense of humor and self-awareness , nothing can be taken quite seriously .  so don't try to make much sense of what goes on in the game , because it doesn't want you to .  what does make sense is the final revelation--when everything becomes apparent and clear .  if taken as it is , the game's ending makes complete sense .  but if you try and critique every minute detail , then you get yourself into plot holes and incredibility .  perhaps that is the reason i docked the film .  while trying to remain realistic and plausible , the plot is too unbelievable to create any real tension on screen .  we don't really care if douglas' character lives or not because it isn't believable .  the ending requires you to have believed anything that has happened previously , but if you suspend disbelief and take the film as it is , you can accept the game as an emotionally and psycholically disturbing thriller .  michael douglas gives a terrific performance as nicholas .  douglas has played lonely businessmen before , but here he adds another level to his performance .  his character , who is normally level-headed and relies on facts , is forced to trust nobody .  can he believe the waitress he bumped into ?  what about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ?  douglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his "" falling down "" persona ) .  the supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical .  sean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas' brother .  deborah kara unger ( from "" crash "" ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good .  in fact , she almost steals the film from douglas .  james rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas' predicament .  another good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from "" shine "" ) as the book editor .  but considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life .  the game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs .  what is essential for this film to work is the writing .  john brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments .  this screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects' did .  however , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot .  and if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year's best films .

1|"originally launched in 1978 , this popular film was re-introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers .  based on the mighty successful musical from broadway , grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2 ( 6 . 5/10 ) ,  starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles .  plot : high-school musical set in the 1950's showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t-birds ( travolta ) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen ( newton-john ) from australia .  the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song , dance and humour .  critique : fun-loving , energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler .  this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950's , with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers .  admittedly , i am somewhat biased in this opinion , since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth ( grease was one of schmoe's first big-screen experiences , and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble-gum card collection ) , and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time .  but apart from the nostalgic vibe , i was still extremely impressed by this film , as it continued to amuse me , despite my previous dozen or so viewings .  this film took john travolta from a dim-witted "" sweathog "" on tv's welcome back kotter , and transformed him into a movie-star of spectacular proportions ( saturday night fever ( 7 . 5/10 ) in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity ) .  unfortunately for the rest of the cast , his popularity was not terribly contagious , despite their effective showings in this classic movie .  on the down side , some of the absolute innocence in this film might bore or turn people off ( like when sandy sings about "" drinking lemonade "" and "" staying out until 10 "" with danny in "" summer nights "" ) , and the plot isn't exactly the most elaborate story-line ever created , but despite these small reservations , this movie carries enough great music and high energy to keep anyone amused through its rapid 110 minute running time ( and believe me . . . i  am not a fan of the musicals ! ! ) .  make sure to look for a young lorenzo lamas in the static role of the brainless football player , as well as the national bandstand dance contest as one of the film's absolute highlights .  and don't forget to buy the popular soundtrack afterwards , so that you could listen to its peppy tunes whenever you're feeling a little blue .  little known facts : henry winkler , of tv's happy days' fonzie fame , turned down the part of danny zuko because he did not want to be typecast for the rest of his career .  both travolta and conaway were smitten by newton-john during the filming of this picture .  conaway eventually bowed out of the woo-fest , and married newton-john's sister a year later ( divorced after five years ) .

1|"set in the late 80's at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie "" genre "" that ellis helped to create .  christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues .  it seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip .  as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel .  i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school .  i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it .  as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn't end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore .  i picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers .  the movie has a similar effect , but at least it's less cryptic than ellis' novel .  for once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on .  both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout .  the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman's impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does .  as a result , the film is immensely more entertaining .  lions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith's catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference .  screenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it .  some cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable .  thankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut .  side note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman's who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she's not a lesbian nor has any interest in it .  the ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian .  it's a subtle in-joke and it's one i found to be pretty humorous .  despite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos .  the real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman .  whenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters .  i always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being .  to say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he's as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger .  one sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news' song "" hip to be square "" right before burying an axe in a co-worker's head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film .  side note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis' "" hip to be square "" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don't expect to see them on the soundtrack release .  huey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of "" stuck in the middle with you "" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release .  i'm assuming that collins requested the same .  on a similar note , whitney houston's cover of "" the greatest love of all "" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn't the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source .  apparently , houston wasn't as open about the use of her song as the others were .  a bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film's release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film .  don't look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more .  several web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i'm still undecided .  there is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto .  the scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) .  i kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) .  other than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman's reality ) .  i think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such .  it may not change anyone's life , but it will certainly have an effect .  i know i will certainly hear "" hip to be square "" in a different context the next time i hear it .

1|"ever wonder what happened to gabe kaplan ?  you remember , he was the title character in that 70's sitcom , "" welcome back kotter . ""  always trying to help out the sweathogs , frequently trying to dodge mr . woodman , ever wary of his wife's tuna casserole .   "" so , "" you ask , "" where is he now ? ""  mr . kaplan actually spends much of his time these days playing professional high-stakes poker .  that's right .  i'm not sure if it's his main source of income , but from what i've heard , the guy occasionally comes away with $20 , 000 at a time .  and there you were , thinking i was going to tell you he was doing off-broadway theater .  you silly goose .  well , gabe kaplan isn't in the movie rounders , nor is the film about the actor come gambler's life .  but rounders is about poker , and gabe plays poker , and i thought that was kind of a neat connection .  sorry about the segue , or lack thereof .  matt damon plays mike mcdermott , a law student who also has a singular talent for the game of poker .  he's been playing for a while , and more than being proficient , he has caught the bug .  he goes to all the underground games in new york city , knows the regulars , and knows how to win .  in the beginning of the film , he's built up a nice thirty grand nest egg , which he takes to the speakeasy-type gaming parlor where the big boys play .  mike is there to make his bid into the upper echelon by staking it all against teddy kgb ( john malkovich ) , an oreo-munching cardshark with ties to the russian mafia .  mike has the potential to take a large pot and go to vegas and buy into the world series of poker , but instead he loses it all in a single hand .  months later , he's paying his way through law school by driving a delivery truck .  when mike's best friend and poker buddy worm ( edward norton ) finishes his jail term for hustling some students , he wants to pick up right were they left off , working as a team to part others with their betting cash .  although mike has stopped playing cards as a promise to his girlfriend and fellow law student , jo ( gretchen mol ) , worm connives mike into playing once more , and mike , bitten again by the bug , slides down that slippery slope , risking his relationship , education , and reputation as playing poker again becomes the focus of his life .  to make a film about gambling , a filmmaker will usually have to play up the glamorous side to get the audience behind the characters .  this is because few moviegoers will care a whole lot about some guy in a leisure suit or terry cloth shirt sitting at a folding card table with a stogie in his mouth .  rounders , however , seems to go more for the latter than the former .  the card clubs mike and worm frequent aren't very glamorous at all .  there's a basement , a lodge with elk heads on the wall , a goulash joint - these are the kinds of locales in which director john dahl sets his shots .  except for one brief instance when the two players visit atlantic city , the film is bereft of the flashing lights of the casinos or the pleasant color of the green felt table .  the reason rounders still captures our attention is because it is less about the game of poker than it is about the personalities which enjoy and are slaves to it .  we're given a nice set of interesting characters with clear motivations , and good actors to play them .  matt damon is very natural as mike , who struggles between his desire to play the straight and narrow by finishing law school , and answering what may be his true calling , playing professional poker .  ed norton's worm is truly a worm , always looking for the angle and playing everyone for what they're worth .  john turturro , who amazes me with his acting range , tones it down in this film by playing joey knish , a virtual poker prodigy in his time who now plays the underground games to make rent and child support payments .  he's both a friend and mentor to mike , and turturro's low-key performance is totally convincing , just as john malkovich's heavily-accented teddy kgb is imposing as an adversarial dragon mike must slay to prove himself .  martin landau is also thrown into the mix as one of mike's law professors , abe petrovsky .  while landau slips well into the role , his character , spitting out personal anecdotes about staying true to one's self , facilitates the channeling of the storyline toward a predictable ending .  perhaps the weak link in the otherwise formidable line-up of acting talent , however , is gretchen mol who just didn't seem to have much presence on screen .  she's a genuine peach to look at , kind of a cross between actress renee zellweger and singer jewel ( and i wouldn't be surprised if the three of them formed some kind of blond-haired triumvirate and attempted to take over the world ) , but her delivered lines seemed very flat , and i found myself looking for matt damon's reactions instead .  a good thing about rounders is that it doesn't get bogged down in the character development and statement making so much that it can't find time for humor .  the film is peppered nicely with scenes that both make you laugh and keep the pacing going , such as a sequence where mike and worm move rapidly around new york from one game to the next , in widely different locales .  one game in a cigar club had me in stitches .   "" i love the sweetness of this dark maduro wrapper , "" says one of the players , clearly more interested in displaying his pretentiousness over the cigar in one hand than in the cards in his other .  i was hoping mike and worm would really take these guys .  with all the poker being played , rounders had the potential to be very confusing .  you might think you know a lot about poker , but think again .  luckily , we're given a narration by damon during the more intricate moments to explain what's going on .  the narrations are more informative than intrusive , and apprise us of what the stakes are and why certain players want to do the things they do .  it's nice that as the characters develop , so does our comprehension of their world .  as a film about success and survival in the realm of underground poker , rounders delivers in spades .  wait !  as a film about the culture of cards , rounders is an ace .  hang on !  packed with great acting and great characters , rounders is a full house .  okay , i guess that's enough .  oh , by the way , if you ever want to get into a game with ol' gabe kaplan , be sure to bring a note from epstein's mother .

1|"did you ever wonder if dennis rodman was actually from this planet ?  or if sylvester stallone was some kind of weird extra-terrestrial ?  i used to think that about my 7th grade english teacher , ms . carey .  but after seeing this movie , they may have confirmed my suspicions .  as the story goes , at any time , there are over a thousand aliens living among us here on earth .  the men in black ( mib ) are the watchdogs that oversee the cosmic citizens , guardians of our beloved planet from nasty-tempered aliens , and secret service to the stars .  based in new york city ( where weird is the norm ) , the mib organization gives human form to our space-faring emigrants so that they may walk and live among us unnoticed .  but to enforce the laws of earth , the mib carry weapons that are powerful enough to meet or exceed destruction quotas in one single blast .  they carry other-worldly technology to erase people's short-term memory when common folk see the mib in action .  and their best leads on cosmic things-gone-awry are the supermarket tabloids .  little do we know that there are much stronger battles of good v . evil going on in the depths of space .  one of the aliens-as-human on this planet is an important diplomat that is carrying something very precious .  it holds the 'key' , literally , to universal peace .  a giant cockroach-like alien soon arrives on the planet and steals this 'key' .  in the wrong alien hands ( flippers ?  mandibles ?  tentacles ? ) , it can be used as a weapon .  therefore , it must be recovered and returned to it's rightful owners .  otherwise , to ensure universal safety , earth will be destroyed , along with the 'key' .  now , it's the mib who must prevent this catastrophe .  the mib agents on the case are "" k "" , played by tommy lee jones .  he is crustier than burnt toast and even more serious than al gore .  the stars in the sky no longer spark wonder in his eyes .  he is accompanied by a flippant rookie , "" j "" , played by will smith .  but , despite this shoot-em-up , protect-earth-from-destruction premise , this is nothing at all like a typical summer action movie .  and , this isn't an independence day knockoff .  rather , this is a stylishly offbeat sci-fi comedy that pokes fun at what the government always denies ? that there are real aliens that live here , and that the government does its darndest to cover them up .  but to give it some sense of excitement and to keep it within the parameters of the summer movie recipe , there must be some kind of earth-hangs-in-the-balance scenario .  yet , this movie is very appealing .  the abundance of wierdness ( talking aliens , pee-wee atomizers , a mortician who 'lives' for her work , and lots of yucky bugs and slime-splattering galore ) , is played straight , like as if this were normal ( of course , we are in nyc ) .  it gives it a deadpan feel , which makes it all the more funnier and odder .  jones plays the venerable seen-it-all agent with seriousness and maturity .  smith is likeable and makes a great comic partner to jones' straight man routine .  they click like dorothy's ruby red shoes .  the look and feel of the movie is made even better with direction from barry sonnenfeld ( the addam's family ) .  this guy has a knack for 'gothic' comedy , and successfully transfers his macabre sense of humor onto the screen .  and , an appropriate dose of special effects helps to bolster the oddness of their task without diverting attention from the human actors .  the story moves well , and before you know it , the end credits are already rolling !  the result is 100 minutes worth of fun in the form of ewwwws and blechhhs , aaaahhhs and wows .  let the men in black protect and color your world .

1|"i feel no hesitation in saying that "" there's something about mary "" is the best film that i will see all year .  from the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 .  it is that good of a film .  when gene siskel said this about "" fargo "" only a few months into '96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous .  how could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ?  but after seeing the farrelly's hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about .  once in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer .  and you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special .  now for the shocker ; "" mary "" is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( "" pink flamingos "" obviously notwithstanding ) .  the movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) .  forget "" blazing saddles "" , "" animal house "" and even the former king of gross-out comedy , "" monty python's meaning of life "" ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly's assault on the senses .  in fact , this may even be the funniest film i've ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is "" monty python and the holy grail "" ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade .  but as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of "" mary "" ; it has a huge heart .  you see , the farrelly's are truly gifted filmmakers .  they don't just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) .  they also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses .  it's funny , though .  if you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable .  but believe me , it is anything but .  ben stiller plays ted , a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe , mary ( cameron diaz ) .  after he sticks up for her retarded brother , warren ( w .  early brown - the cameraman , believe it or not , from "" scream "" ) , his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom .  in one of the film's funniest scenes , something goes wrong ( i won't ruin it for those who know nothing about the film ) and ted is unable to face mary ever again .  jump to the present .  after years of self-loathing , ted finally hires private detective pat healy ( a suitably slimy matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school .  healy finds that mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself .  admittingly , the basic story line leaves a little to be desired .  after all , with a not-really-all-that-funny premise , how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours ?  somehow , the farrelly's pull it off .  the performances here are also right on target .  as ted , stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating , as he would normally be , but very lovable .  and cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons , but the actor who really grabs your attention is w . earl brown as mary's brother .  no other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here .  i know he won't be nominated , but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february .  as good as the actors are , though , it's the directors' movie all the way .  i guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year , you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg's wwii epic "" saving private ryan "" .  and yes , that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting .  but which is harder ; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can't breath for minutes at a time ?  i'll let you decide that one for yourself , but this critic is sticking to his guns .  there is just something about "" mary "" .

1|" "" i'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell , "" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher .  with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister , hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story .  he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american , and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation .  from elmer gantry on , we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church .  well , think again , for the apostle , which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade , does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister , and by implication all , the rest of organized religion .  instead it gives us a highly devout man , who certainly has his foibles , but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god .  and arguably just as surprising , the good-spirited film is no comedy , even if it does have humorous moments .  instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures .  when in the privacy of his attic , robert duvall , as texas preacher euliss "" sonny "" dewey , argues sternly with his lord , the scene shares a kinship with emily watson's character crying out for her god in breaking the waves's most powerful scene .  the body of the story starts with sonny's coming upon an horrific auto accident , which is another part of life generally ignored by modern screenwriters .  with his well worn bible in hand , sonny leaps from his car so that he can go pray over and with the accident's dying victims .  the scowling police officer orders him to go away , and , after he has tried to work his miracles , sonny leaves with a smile in the confidence that he has done the lord's work .  robert duvall not only gives a moving and realistic performance surely destined to receive an academy award nomination but is also the film's director , writer , executive producer , and chief financier .  rarely has a movie been such a labor of love .  with a white suit , peach-colored shirt and tie , and dark sunglasses , sonny looks as much like a rock star as a preacher .  duvall has every movement down pat .  even when he is walking down the street , the ever strutting sonny cannot contain his energy .  he dances and claps all the way .  sonny's churches having more black members than white means that he shares his preaching duties with many deep-voiced black orators , but his rhetoric is always competitive .   "" i may be on the devil's hit-list , but i'm on god's mailing list , "" he shouts to the congregation in a revival tent .  and they lap it up .  people jump up , scream , "" praise the lord ! ""  and mean it .  the intensity of their shared religious experience is palpable .  but sonny is no saint .  it turns out that he has a wandering eye , which angers his wife jessie , played in a remarkably controlled performance by farrah fawcett .  jessie gets her revenge by taking up with the church's youth minister and conniving to gain control over sonny's church , leaving him unemployed .  sonny , letting his temper get the best of him , does something foolish , which causes him to have to leave town and two beloved kids forever .  the bulk of the film occurs in a small , predominately black church in louisiana , which he builds up from a derelict building with no congregation into a remodeled church ( "" one way road to heaven : holiness temple "" ) with an enthusiastic flock .  in this part he rebaptizes himself as the apostle e . f . the apostle is a hard worker willing to take on any odd job necessary to obtain the funds for his church .  he asks his members to tithe , but he gives all of his money .  and his good deeds extend to secret donations of food for the local poor folks .  a man who can't stand to be still , he tells one of his friends , "" i quit school because i didn't like recess . ""  in his new town he meets toosie ( miranda richardson ) , who , like him , has a family that she hasn't seen in a while .  his romance with the separated woman , like the rest of the film , doesn't follow the standard patterns we have grown to expect from our movies .  billy bob thornton shows up one day playing a local racist and general troublemaker .  his confrontation with the apostle is yet another of show's many surprising scenes , again breaking many rules and conceptions about what approach deeply religious people might take .  although it probably couldn't have ended any other way , the movie does wrap things up nicely .  and don't miss the sweet epilogue during the film's closing credits .  a tour de force acting performance by duvall and a surprising and unrelentingly dedicated script makes for an outstanding and moving film .  the apostle runs a little too long at 2 : 12 .  it is rated pg-13 for mild profanity and brief violence and would be fine for kids eleven and up .
