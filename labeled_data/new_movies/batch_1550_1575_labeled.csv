0|disillusioned and trying to find the spice of life , richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) sets off for thailand .  there he a meets crazed man by the name of daffy ( robert carlyle ) who gives him a map to a beach , a secret utopia , then commits suicide .  richard sets off for this beach with his neighbors from this hotel , ? tienne ( guillaume canet ) and fran ? oise ( virginie ledoyen ) .  once they get there the three discover a secret society existing on this beach , there richard falls for fran ? oise .  this covers about half to two thirds of the movie and aside from the romantic element , which is solely a creation of hollywood , seems to hold to the original novel .  the cinematography and general beauty of this part of the movie is breathtaking .  i don't think anyone can argue that this movie is visually stunning .  but that is were many things go wrong , darius khondji has totally outdone himself in doing the cinematography .  though the script and the interpretation of the novel are quite lacking .  the plot of the movie moves along at a decent pace for about half of the movie or there abouts .  this is where the movie has some great potential , then the three travelers get the island and there is a turn for the better , yes folks i said better .  now up to about two thirds of this movie its actually pretty good , nothing spectacular aside from the cinematography but it still has promise .  this is where things start to degenerate to something that becomes almost un-watchable .  there is even a 'video game' style sequence that borders on the disgusting , it doesn't make sense for the movie and just looks dumb in my opinion ( and i am hoping many other peoples ) .  i am hoping that in my little rant i've made it abundantly clear that the movie is lacking quite seriously in plot and uneven pacing , so if you go see it and you don't like it because of this don't blame me .  the character development was not up to par either ; i found the character of richard to be nothing more than a spoiled child .  although there is a feeble attempt to make this whole story profound it fails and richard ( leo's character ) comes off as a wannabe philosopher .  the character seems to be underdeveloped from the get go and seems to just do things for no apparent reason , granted some people are like this ( myself included ) but i nor anyone i know that is fairly random would ever do things of the sort this character does .  the next point is that some of the really interesting characters are simply not developed enough .  richard is obviously obsessed by fran ? oise at the early stages of the story , yet there is actually very little development along this story line .  this i am sure contributes to the movie's lack of core plot and being unfocused .  now , i shall move onto something a little better about the movie ( for all you cynics out there the movie did have a few good things about it ) .  the cast and acting was passable at the very least , and i think that leonardo dicaprio actually did pretty well in the role of richard .  mind you i think the rest of the cast that had some which had reasonably sized roles did equally well if not better .  which begs the question why is leonardo paid so much ?   ( i think this is a topic all on its own so i won't get into it ) .  but i like the fact that there was an international cast used , had only and american cast been used i can see this movie being horrible .  the international flavor added a more global feel to the movie that made it that much more bearable .  not to mention the movie is set in thailand and a global cast makes more sense .  when all is said and done i liked the movie for the most part but the gaping inadequacies of the plot are unforgivable .  i would not recommend this movie to anyone , the fact that i liked it has a lot to do with the cinematography and the sheer beauty of the movie not its plot or story .  as it is the story tries to be much too philosophical and fails at its attempt .  if you do end up going to see this movie be forewarned about its shortcomings .  |-0.244|0.8000000000000002|0.7066666666666667|Overall, the explanations indicate a negative sentiment towards the movie, with criticism of the plot, character development, and pacing, as well as the script and interpretation of the novel.

0|"this review contains spoilers , but believe me , i don't say anything you can't guess 10 minutes into the movie .  i * did * go into this one with high expectations .  i had been exposed to media reports that this film would signify a departure from the slasher flicks .  i sort of expected another exorcist or the shining .  i even put aside my general rule of not seeing this type of film .  boy , was i wrong !  another garbage slasher flick , the only difference being that * this * one has a story !  the story , you ask ?  well , a scumball buys a chinese puzzle from a guy in an arab souk .  he takes it home , somehow getting it past customs : - ) and starts fiddling with it in his attic .  lo and behold , after he takes it apart , three demons appear and start taking him apart , but with meat hooks .  when they're finished , his gizzards are hanging from the ceiling .  they botch up their cleanup job , however , and manage to leave his heart ( or some gland ; i didn't really recognize the organ ) under a floorboard .  the guy's brother and his brother's wife appear at the door soon after , and decide to move in .  they throw away scumball's belongings , and set up house .  turns out that wife is a bit of a nympho , and screwed around with scumball right before her marriage .  she starts having some wild hallucinations .  later , hubby spills some blood on the attic floorboards ( slow-mo special effects of the buckets of blood hitting the ground--all from the tiny cut on his hand ) .  said blood is eagerly sucked up by scumball's organ .  the organ grows into a thing that requires yet more blood in order to complete the regeneration into a really ugly thing .  it establishes mind contact with wife , who agrees to help him get more blood , because she really wants to be screwed again .  so , she helps him kill three businessmen .  scumball , at this time , gradually gets his strength back and grows all his organs back .  problem is , he doesn't have any skin , and even after three or four corpses , still doesn't get any skin .  he finally gets some , though , but strangely enough , he ends up looking like his brother .  guess they couldn't get the original actor back .  who knows .  scumball ( whose name is frank ) is not a nice guy .  he describes his torture by the demons fondly , as the "" ultimate pleasure and pain , since at that level there is no difference between the two . ""  somehow , i don't see getting torn apart by 90 fish- and meat-hooks a lot of fun .  this guy is * so * bad ( "" how bad * is * he ? "" ) ,   * so * bad that the * rats * cower in a corner in fear .  for good reason , too ; he crucifies two of them for fun , and carves a third while the nympho's horsing around with hubby .  anyway . hubby's daughter ( who , if course , is not * wife's * daughter ) starts to suspect something is wrong after she sees wife going into the attic with one of her johns and the ensuing screams .  the dumb bimbo meets scumball , and is not impressed .  she manages to escape with the chinese puzzle , and brings out the demons .  at any rate , the demons are pissed off that they screwed up their cleanup ; they're normally quite meticulous about that type of thing .  the story boils down to the demons trying to correct their mistake .  the demons are not , however , the good guys .  the dumb bimbo's the good guy .  she somehow not only gets them to take care of frank , but also banishes them to hell or oblivion , we're not too sure which .  not too shabby for someone with single-digit iq .  this is basically a "" bad jinn "" story .  it is an * awful * movie .  awful acting , bad focus in the photography , many scenes of skin being penetrated by meathooks , which is really unrealistic , and looks like the latex that it is .  continuity ?  who cares .  acting ?   * terrible * .  script ?  horrible .  sounds canned .  unrealistic .  story is so-so , but the impact is lost long , long before the film ends .  i do think the * rat * acting was quite good .  i have never seen rats look afraid .  they should get nominated for an award .  really good acting there , the best in the movie .

0|" "" have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming ? ""  obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment , and so to finish us utterly , they have now released "" urban legends : final cut "" .  this is another "" scream "" -like feature , consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip-offs from the most pointless movies of all time .  amy ( jennifer morrison ) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do .  but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious university's film program -- where each year's best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize , a virtual one-way ticket to hollywood success -- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese ( loretta devine ) , whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines .  soon enough , fake -- and real -- blood starts to flow , and amy is being chased around by scary killer , while her cast and crew get slain , one by one .  is the culprit the original urban legends murderer , just some random psycho , !  a member of the faculty , one of her competitors for the hitchcock , or is there something even more stupid going on ?  this is another one of those tiring , pointless teen slasher flicks : neither scary , funny , or interesting .  it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain .  the body counts and screams continue to grow , as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly .  in fact watching films like that after having watched "" scary movie "" is impossible keeping a serious face .  several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing , without succeeding .  and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing .  it's the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century .  how many times must we tolerate the same clich ? s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth ?  it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them .  they are the most stupid , meaningless , predictable and soulless films in existence .  however , director john ottman manages to make "" urban legends : final cut "" into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre .  what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in "" scream "" , ottman takes seriously .  for that reason alone , it is worth a look , just to realize how bad a movie can be .  it's tough to find comparisons for such an achievement , and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect .  even movies like "" lost in space "" and "" mission to mars "" seem spectacular in its shadow .  we have not seen such waste of t !  ime and resources since "" showgirls "" ( 1995 ) .  no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production , i came up with nothing , except the way the killer was dressed .  here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie-sylvie deveu , that have wisely replaced the well known scream-mask with a very elegant fencing mask .  jennifer morrison ( "" stir of echoes "" ) is all right , and the other actors' best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script .  in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film ( with the exception of its screenplay ) is its portray of film schools .  if these graduates will be the directors of the future , then hollywood's golden days are over .  rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment .  let's just hope and pray that it's just an urban legend .

0|" "" we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us . ""  starring lee kang-sheng , yang kuei-mei directed by tsai ming-liang written by tsai and yang ping-ying cinematography by liao peng-jung  taiwan , 24/12/99 .  the millenium approaches .  an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city .  sectors of the city are being sealed , quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus .  the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours , hide from bright lights , huddle in damp corners .  the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a week's time .  residents are advised to evacuate the area , asap .  this premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole , which could have been a great movie , but , sadly , ends up as a waste of good ideas .  the quick sketch above suggests a dark , absurd , hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution , however , it is nothing like that .  the virus , the evacuation , the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background .  instead , the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building , and who have no personalities .  the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex , photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible .  it's a vivid setting , but an unappealing one , especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background .  the man lives in the apartment directly above the woman's .  one day , a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the man's living room , opening into the ceiling of the woman's living room .  this hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the character's lonely , compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways .  example : the man , suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole .  the woman , wandering around in the dark , accidentally puts her hand on his vomit , and then cleans it up .  this is what passes for meaningful communication .  and they say romance is dead .  much of the film does not even focus on their interactions , such as they are .  there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people .  they are ciphers .  instead , we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch , for instance , as the woman boils some water , pours it onto some noodles , then eats the noodles .   ( this is as fascinating as it sounds . )  offered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers , fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular , so i'm told , in 1950s' china ) .  she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells , incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights .  sometimes , in these fantasies , she is joined by the man .  these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful , sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality , but they fail .  when the man and the woman dance , it seems half-hearted and listless .  astaire and rogers this is not .  even in imagination , these people are numb , weary , boring .  the hole is part of the 'collection 2000' series , a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium .  others include canada's last night , brazil's midnight , and american hal hartley's the book of life .  the book of life is the only other one that i have seen , and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry .  witty , energetic , humane , it makes the the hole seem ( ahem ) empty .  american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements , quick cuts , superficial emotions .  foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does : they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time , and call it art .  the hole is self-evidently a film about alienation , and perhaps director tsai ming-liang wants the audience to share in his characters' alienation .  if so , he succeeds .  perhaps it is a challenge : he dares us to enjoy this movie , despite his best attempts to ensure that we don't .  if it was a challenge , i wasn't up for it .

0|"blatantly borrowing elements from 1993's "" like water for chocolate "" and 1991's "" the butcher's wife , "" "" simply irresistible "" attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy but , more often than not , comes off as laughable , leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar ( t . v .

"" simply irresistible "" is a ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic fantasy that's as flimsy as a slice of bologna .  it takes one joke---that people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways---and recycles it over and over again until the film has reached an appropriate running time of 95 minutes .  add in a music montage every ten minutes ( these are actually the best scenes in the movie , which certainly tells you something about the film itself ) , and what you've got is an utterly empty , if not necessarily boring , excursion .  the cast of "" simply irresistible "" is fairly good , but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting .  patricia clarkson ( 1998's "" high art , "" in which she played a drugged-out lesbian ) is a standout as tom's colleague , and is thankfully given a few funny lines of dialogue .  also of note is larry gilliard jr . , as amanda's cooking assistant and buddy , who is allowed to create a seemingly full character out of only a handful of scenes .  of the main stars , sarah michelle gellar is fine , but really does often look like she's struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material , and if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future , he has certainly got to pick better projects than this .  the bottom line is that "" simply irresistible "" is the exact opposite of its deprophesized title , and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in mid-air ( an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid last scene ) , my mind checked out from the characters and the romance .  when i think about it in hindsight , i should have checked out in the very first scene , where the point of the action was for gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical crab .  now , that certainly is what i'd call magical !

0|i wont even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films .  i saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3 , but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them .  so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective : alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard days work .  i didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful ; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing  but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning .  sigourney weaver , whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination , plays the character of ripley ,  who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3 . 200 years later , scientists use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley - including the alien that was stuck inside her .  in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two ; yet ripley is now not completely human , possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being .  im sure someone can explain exactly why this is so , but for now well just ignore it and move on .  why , you ask , would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated ?  well , the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature .  these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research .  they ( yawn ) were wrong .  it doesnt take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un-flossed teeth .  theres a little saying that goes something like this : if youre going to make a bad film , do it well .   i have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies , but they are not the ones that really bother me .  alien resurrection , a good example of a film that really gets up my nose , is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one .  there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore , which attempts to distract us from the wandering-but-not-going-anywhere plot .  in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off .  another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to .  fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story , but this is unfortunately not the case , and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable .  if you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film , then you thought right .  one exciting scene is a credit ( and the only part remotely worth seeing ) to the film , in which an alien chases two men ( one a cripple ) up a tall ladder with interesting results .  but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard , and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis .  so in a film where the one liners come as bad as earth man , what a shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent , its no wonder why alien : resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is .  oh , and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies  the less i enjoy a film , the more i eat .  so all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes ; but however empty the bag turned out to be , it was still a long way ahead of the movie  |-0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.7666666666666666|"The sentiment of the explanations is overwhelmingly negative, with the reviewer expressing disappointment and disapproval towards the movie ""Alien: Resurrection.""

0|"synopsis : lifelong friends rafe ( affleck ) and danny ( hartnett ) join the us air force and are stationed at pearl harbor , hawaii .  rafe goes to england to fight alongside british pilots and is seemingly killed in action .  danny falls in love with rafe's girlfriend , evelyn ( beckinsale ) , but rafe survives and returns to confront his former friend .  meanwhile , the japanese sneak attack is imminent . . .  review : "" pearl harbor "" is a perfect example of movies as product rather than as art .  it is little more than a crassly-calculated attempt to woo the masses , enticing them with big stars , big effects , and a big setting -- but no heart .  it is difficult to criticise the actors , because they do everything the movie demands of them .  sadly , this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing "" pearl harbor "" with his left .  the plot here is pure cliche , and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop .  there is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states , and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii .  instead , there is just an assembly-line love triangle , some empty patriotic rhetoric , and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders ( when one intones , "" i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant "" , i nearly fell out of my seat ) .  to the movie's credit , it does include a fantastic portrayal of the attack itself , an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war .  if only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such skill , perhaps this memorial day non-event would have been worth watching .

0|this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st .  elsewhere for several years , and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also .  i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations , nor were they satisfactory .  if i had to list a reason why . . . .  but that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it's not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film .  adam arkin plays a grade-school teacher who is sardonic , cynical , and somewhat abrasive , but a good teacher .  he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court .  one day , he meets a drifter ( david morse , who plays jack morrison on st .  elsewhere ) in the park , and inveigles him in a game of one-on-one basketball .  morse turns out to be good , and a friendship slowly develops between the two , as their respective professions progress on the screen--arkin's teaching , and morse's selling of paper flowers to passing motorists .  so far , my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue , and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack .  good music to be sure , but it doesn't replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story--it makes the film somewhat minimalistic , a technique i rarely admire .  suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse's introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin's , a woman arkin has long admired from afar , but it too reticent to approach .  it appears that she begins to admire morse ( who enjoys here attentions , but isn't sure what to do about it--she doesn't realize that he is a drifter , and knows nothing about his past ) , and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else .  until then , i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film .  the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full-fledged failure .  the woman , at least to me , appeared to be fairly shallow ; i didn't realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin , where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse .  somehow , this is made to appear as if it is arkin's fault , and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he's gotten such a find of girlfriend .  frankly , dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make ; punching her in the mouth not the least .  after this , the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural .  if i had to summarize a major gripe , it's that this is a story spread too thin , that creates semi-likable characters at the outset , and then suddenly jerks them into being 16-year-olds at the last moment .  it might be true-to-life with some people ; but that doesn't mean * i * have to like it .  i don't .   .  avoid .  |-0.6833333333333332|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment towards the film is negative, with the main complaints being the unsatisfactory results, lack of dialogue, intrusive soundtrack, shallow characters, and unappealing conclusion, leading to a strong recommendation to avoid the film.
0|i love movies .  i really do .  every time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display .  even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value .  then there's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money .  disney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk .  christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t . v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship .  along with his 'zoot' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t . v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim's 'uncle martin . '  'laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events , but never does .  many bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn't appear to try to provide any entertainment .  filled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy .  christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now .  jeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless .  his performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance he gives .  darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited .  hurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a twit' and wins the david wilcock award for 'most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture . '  way to go liz !  for the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going 'he was the guy in . . . ah . . er . . . '  before finally giving up and switching off .  another major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick . '  unfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny . '  instead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick .  although meant to be a manic character no doubt , every line that comes out of his 'neck' is a dud .  a real dud .  citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester .  even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk .  it's a nice special effect , though .  another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves .  or rather , the lack of them .  my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl , down the pipe and into the sewer .  now , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed .  but here , characters farting , belching and almost getting crapped on ( literally ) is not 'amusing . '  it's insulting .  there's one good gag right before the credits , but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued .  either that , or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn't mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes .  yes , men at work .  yowza !  the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film , and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more .  there are thousands of brilliant films out there that can't get distribution , yet trash like this gets released nation-wide with ease .  thankfully , as soon as it makes it's money , it will never be seen again , and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie : down the toilet .  |0.3116666666666667|0.9333333333333332|0.9|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is mixed, with a positive sentiment towards movies in general and negative sentiment specifically towards the movie ""My Favorite Martian""."

"" earthquake "" is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured .  on video , it's a bland and slow-moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters ( the disaster film requisite ) , then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster .  while this worked in , say , "" the towering inferno , "" it doesn't here for one single reason : we don't care about any of the characters .  the film gives us charlton heston ( in one of many crap 70s films he made , including "" skyjacked "" and that classic , "" soylent green "" ) as a rich man married to ava gardner , who is having a little affair with a young single mom ( genieveve bujold ) ; a renegade police officer on suspension ( george kennedy , in his least humored performance ) ; in the second weirdest subplot , a motorcycle stuntman ( richard roundtree , right after his "" shaft "" thing ) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down ( yea , snore ) ; and the weirdest subplot : a military man/bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal , and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair ( ! ! ! ) .  in smaller subplots , there's a pointless bit about people who are flying over l . a .

""  who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires ?  and who cares about that whole plane spiel ?  if anything , "" earthquake "" is worth a viewing for the same reason "" glen or glenda ?

0|"the formula is simple .  trap a varied group of people on an isolated location , then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one .  these have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing , alien , aliens , and tremors to name a few ) .  so , why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad ?   ( see the relic for a particularly putrid example . )  perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas .  deep rising meets these two requirements part way , but not enough to salvage the film .  treat williams is finnegan , the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity . . . no  questions asked .  this time , however , they may have gone too far .  their passengers , led by the ominous wes studi , are the type of multi-national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films .  and their cargo . . . let's  just say it has very high explosive potential .  what is the target of these thieves ?  why , the argonauticus , of course , a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage .  but something else is hunting the argonauticus . . . something  ancient and deadly .  by the time the thieves arrive , nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed .  and now the creature senses fresh meat !  so , you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew , joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald ) , and a thief with less lofty goals , trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep .  and the monster gets to pick them off one by one .  fortunately for the creature , this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer .  why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food .  if there's a more clarion call for unity , i don't know what it might be .  it's pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when .  there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end .  for the most part , the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audience's impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first .   ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsou's life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad . )  treat williams is a passable hero , and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation .  but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy , very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way .  the biggest treat in the film , however , has to be pantucci , kevin j . o'connor's whining engine-boy , under finnegan's employ .  his constant quips may be a bit over-written , but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss , for that matter ) .  it's just a stock part ( the comic-relief character ) , but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable .  as far as the monster goes , although the cgi is done well , the creature has no logical consistency .  think back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters .  they all had a set of "" rules "" about what they could do , and how and why they would do it .  part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering , along with the heroes , just what those rules are .  the tentacle monster in deep rising doesn't have a set of rules . . .  or if it does , not a very good one .  it merely eats ( or drinks , as the case may be ) , and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so .  the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place .  it simply happens .  the action scenes are decent , but few are noteworthy .  the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic .  deep rising's peril in the water scenes pale next to cameron's ( but can you really blame them ) .  unfortunately , deep rising's efforts are more on par with speed 2 .  on the plus side , however , the film's closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel .  perhaps you'd be better off waiting for that one .

0|my giant begins with a monologue that's more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride , ' medieval fairy-tale-in-the- ? 90s feel .  i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream .  and when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it .  the film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects .  i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max-sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons .  i also liked jere burns' ( from tv's `something so right' ) performance as the director of the film in romania .  at this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast-paced first scene .  it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech .  however , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive .  off the high board .  suddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball .  up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he didn't come off as a desperate jerk .  if he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical .  but now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film .  indeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces .  this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas .  while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it .  and the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare .  at this point i found myself thinking , `we're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? '  then i realized he was , and i was watching it .  in the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality .  note : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph .  max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn't seen him since he was a normal-sized kid .  her refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means' scene as sammy's wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna .  i found this scene offensive .  not only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved .  i think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all .  late in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably .  this could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy's transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too !  `my giant' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions .  a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy's struggles to get money and become a better person .  in this scenario , max's illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator .  sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally .  instead , we're apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we're not allowed to focus on max .  crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `my giant' left me feeling like i'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon .  |-0.08646666666666665|0.8833333333333334|0.3833333333333333|The overall sentiment of the text is slightly mixed, with a slight tendency towards a negative sentiment.

""  the result is a mix of genres that don't mesh well .  elements of the ritz brothers-style comedy ( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939 "" the three musketeers "" ) , the man with no name from "" a fistful of dollars "" ( d'artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western ) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano .  the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the "" matrix "" crowd .  alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters .  the real problem with the "" the musketeer "" lies in the casting of the two lead , romantically intertwined characters , d'artagnan and francesca ( mena suvari ) .  chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character , a la chris o'donnell , but lacks any onscreen charisma .  suvari has the doe-eyed , pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen , but she , too , does not have the chemistry to command the screen .  if "" the musketeer "" makes them any money , they should invest in acting lessons .  stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one .  the supporting cast is , on the surface , impressive .  catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty , dignity and humor , especially when she plays off of d'artagnan's mentor , planchet ( jean-pierre castaldi , who reminds of andre the giant in "" the princess bride ) .  stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu , but is given very little to help flesh out his character .  tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinal's chief henchman , febre .  he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout .  the rest of the players , particularly the three musketeers aramis ( nick moran , "" lock , stock and two smoking barrels "" ) , porthos ( steve spiers ) and athos ( jan gregor kremp ) , are background fodder whose role is to come to d'artagnan's aid when needed .  peter hyam's does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well .  a stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps .  photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions - d'artagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single-handed ; he fights a gang of febre's henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen ( with the obligatory branches hanging over the road ) ; he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy , febre , who murdered d'artagnan's folks years before .  it is all routine stuff .  the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap , defying gravity , up walls and from horse to horse .  it works in a sci-fi film like "" the matrix "" or in a classical fantasy like "" crouching tiger , hidden dragon "" but just calls attention to itself in "" the musketeer .

0|"i think maybe it's time for the batman series to be put to rest .  not only has the first two films' unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a "" superhero "" been abandoned , but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment .  let me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie , batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris o'donnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond .  mr . freeze's thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks , but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes , at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick , grabs the diamond , and stick-handles it through the museum .  i might have expected this from an airplane-style farce , but i don't think that's what this movie is supposed to be .  after all , the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero/action genre and kept the corny death-defying stunts to a minimum , while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony .  not any more ; the list goes on and on in this one .  robin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30 , 000 feet high in the atmosphere , climbing in the door to save batman .  mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond .  a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he-man cartoons .  my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs , during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her .  not bad , but wouldn't the police ( or maybe batman ? )  notice if the road was on fire ?  i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place , but .   .   .   .  it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment .  as if three protagonists and two villains weren't enough , batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce wayne's butler alfred ( michael gough ) , which might have seemed poignant if it wasn't surrounded by so much silliness , as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruce's girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie .  all this might be semi-excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining , but it isn't .  in fact , it's kind of boring .  mr . freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholson's joker and danny devito's penguin .  their evil plot is as predictable ( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words , "" today gotham city , tomorrow the world !

0|"in my opinion , a movie reviewer's most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion .  but with soul survivors , i'm so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous , uncontrollable rant , obligations damned .  however , protocol forces me to do otherwise .  soul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent .  party girl annabel ( eliza dushku of bring it on ) is dating world-weary harvard student matt ( wes bentley ) .  matt still has feelings for cassie , who is now dating sean ( casey affleck ) .  driving back from a creepy , gothic party , the quartet gets into a horrific car crash .  sean dies , leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty , made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her .  as cassie mopes through her classes , she sees the ghost of sean all over the place , urging her to follow him .  along with being plagued by other ghastly visions , cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party .  annabel and matt try calming her down , but no one shares cass's visions .  she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself .  rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material .  in his directorial debut , steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion .  when the movie's camerawork isn't pedestrian , it's clich ? d .  carpenter's need for close-ups , his camera following sagemiller from behind , drain the movie of any anticipation .  we already know what to look for , so why should we be surprised ?  and the sense of scary atmosphere , which was recently done so well in the others , is nowhere to be found here .  carpenter's script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness .  this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character , which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around .  the second lamest device , of course , is the , "" oh , it was all a dream "" resolution .  and guess what ?  this movie has both !  not that the main body of the film , which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown , is anything worthwhile .  since there's no captivating dialogue , no character chemistry exists anywhere .  that's a huge problem , since the four main characters are supposed to be couples .  carpenter can't even get the smutty scenes right , which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it .  [the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats .  -ed . ]  when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club , he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts .  and when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint , they're fully clothed .  regardless , any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity .  why wouldn't they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ?  why would they shower in their clothes ?  what if they weren't covered in latex paint ?  the cast , which will see better material in the future , would be wise to leave this one off their resumes .  i felt sorry for affleck , who i've liked in other movies , and bentley , who was great in american beauty .  dushku , who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality , has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan .  as for sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned get over it ) , i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person , and not an object for gawking .  and i'm not even getting into luke wilson's role as a priest .  at least he's friends with wes anderson .  bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it .

"" analyze this "" has a few laughs sprinkled throughout ( mostly in the first half ) , but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan , ramis , and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke ( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles , while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal ) and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106-minute running time .  admittedly , de niro is very funny here ( and i can't remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him ) , and crystal is in top-form , but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them , including a substantial plotline .  since "" analyze this "" bills not one , not two , but three writers , you'd think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws , but they must have all been on auto-pilot .  one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters , all of which have next to nothing to do and aren't even given multi-dimensional characters to attempt to develop .  coming off of her oscar-caliber work in two of last year's best films , "" clockwatchers "" and "" the opposite of sex , "" lisa kudrow's throwaway "" girlfriend "" role is an incredible step down .  sure , kudrow's fellow "" friend "" jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in "" office space , "" but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston .  kudrow , meanwhile , mostly just stands around , no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place .  chazz palminteri , as rival gangster primo , fares even worse , in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character .  finally , molly shannon ( rising film star and cast member on "" saturday night live "" ) has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystal's patients and then completely disappears .  too bad , considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal .  once "" analyze this "" approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrow's laura standing alone at the altar once again , i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone , and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most , ben .  afterwards , the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul , became a real laugh-free dead-zone , losing its last remaining comic punches .

0|"as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn't loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions .  this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) .  they fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges' life by shooting an unarmed pow .  that's against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances .  certainly hodges is not complaining .  years pass .  hodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer .  childers , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould .  because of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops .  childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command .  after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd .  more than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down .  childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians .  he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film .  did childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ?  or are there simply no rules in war ?  the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions .  the murder of 83 "" innocent civilians "" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ?  where is the u . n . ?  the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ?  this film ( in a way akin to films such as "" a few good men "" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism .  these accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair .  what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking .  one of the earliest apparent problems with 'rules of engagement' is its lack of credibility .  the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed .  a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality .  that is precisely why it's not offensive .  it is completely unobjective .  many stories are started and never finished .  many questions are asked , but never answered .  a lot of parallels are referring to nothing .  it seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film .  is it about arab mentality ?  america's foreign policies ?  america's role in the world ?  corruption in the higher circles ?  it goes on and on .  it consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot .  it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one .  i think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin's probably most acclaimed film was "" the exorcist "" which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film .  in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film .  though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage .  i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed .  it's obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe .  the characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict .  even the actors can not save this film from going under .  though both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of .  they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back .  jackson is gray and jones uninteresting .  the rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks .  the time has come for the verdict .  on the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty .  on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty .  but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty , because of it's inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere , not only when concerning the arab population .  i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far , portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad-guys .  this is very sad , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth .  however , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states .  and that it's not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east , including yemen are on constant maximum alert .

""  side of things .  all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didn't make me feel any more fulfilled .  what was hedwig's relationship with that other member of his band ( with the beard ) ?  what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie ?   ( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy ? )  what ever happened to the lawsuit ?  and more . . .  all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat .  if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his/her sexuality , then that's one thing , but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie , i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well .  i didn't get it .  the film's humor also didn't tickle my funny bone either .  then again , i've seen many a film in these art-house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter , while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen .  some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added "" atmosphere "" of a plant called marijuana , and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements , in order to jazz up that experience .  but being sober as i was and expecting a coherent , funny , musical with a transsexual twist , i didn't leave the theater very satisfied .  i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle , wrapped in metaphors , dramatics and more questions than answers .  i will , on the other hand , definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film , john cameron mitchell , who is also the man who wrote , directed and created the play on which this movie is based , and the tunes , which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols , david bowie and the whole 70s glam-rock scene .  note : btw , it seems as though pretty much every single "" mainstream "" critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom ( and thought that it was really funny to boot ! ) , so you might want to take that into consideration yourself .  but having said that , the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the "" official "" critics , while i , a regular "" joblo "" in the audience , just wouldn't get what all the fuss was about .  this movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews .  where's joblo coming from ?  moulin rouge ( 8/10 ) - grease ( 8/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - the opposite of sex ( 8/10 ) - dancer in the dark ( 5/10 ) - o brother , where art thou ( 7/10 ) - love's labour's lost ( 8/10 )  "|-0.6833333333333332|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment is negative as the reviewer expresses disappointment and a lack of satisfaction with the film ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"" criticizing its incoherence, pretension, lack of resolution, and dissatisfaction with the humor and characters.

'  these turn out to be very wise words .  8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution .  the set-up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her .  this is where everything goes awry .  although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula .  everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects .  although it had enormous potential , the third act of 8mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control .  cage is the film's sole flame of energy .  his performance is actually believable , but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation .  still , you've got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand .  welles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the industry .  this is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film .  he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie .  written by andrew kevin walker , 8mm dissipates into a poor man's seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece .  furthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ?  the director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) .  this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career , so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side .  |-0.7833333333333332|0.8666666666666667|0.23333333333333336|"The explanations all highlight the negative tone and critical nature of the text towards the movie ""8mm"".

"" the whole nine yards "" is neither facetious nor , aside from the subplot about jill's shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman , inventive , and more often than not , just lies there , the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector , but never igniting any sort of spark .  a few select actors do what they can with the material , while others make no impact at all .  on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters : matthew perry and bruce willis .  perry , innocuously enjoyable on tv's "" friends , "" plays the same exact sitcom-style character in all of his movies ( from 1997's "" fools rush in "" to 1999's "" three to tango "" ) , and it has become a crushing bore .  meanwhile , willis makes next to no impression , and because of the limited guise of his jimmy "" the tulip "" tudeski , oftentimes disappears into the background .  their three female counterparts fare noticeably better .  best of all is natasha henstridge , far more radiant than in the exploitative "" species "" movies , who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia .  henstridge has the talent , for sure , to break out of these countless throwaway roles , but first she must fire her agent .  amanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill , and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who , thus far , has strived on a career based solely on comedy .  it is too bad , then , that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene , with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts .  finally , rosanna arquette is awful as sophie , but something tells me that was her purpose , and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time .  also popping up is michael clarke duncan , fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in "" the green mile , "" as jimmy's largely built friend and fellow killer , frankie figs .  when "" the whole nine yards "" eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion , one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit .  a great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past , and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films , so what was the point ?  without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments , "" the whole nine yards "" rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast , and half of the actors are not charming at all .  now , what does that tell you ?
