1|"hilarious , ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian o'halloran and jeff anderson ) .  they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment .  the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out , but you could spend ten times the film's budget ( a reported $27 , 000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this .  originally rated nc-17 for language .  not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears .  killing zoe ===========  remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and you're halfway to killing zoe , writer/director roger avary's slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery .  eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers .  he's the safecracker who's blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go .  though intriguing on all fronts , the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction , which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino .  in english and french .  the road to wellville =====================  based on the novel by t . coraghessan boyle , the road to wellville doesn't go very far .  bowels , bowels , and more bowels are explored by dr . john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins ) , who , in the early 1900's , advocated abstinence , vegetarianism , and frequent defecation .  he also invented the cornflake .  really .  checking-in to kellogg's battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda , just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy .  leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack , michael lerner , lara flynn boyle , john neville , and dana carvey .  the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing , but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama .  what he ends up with is something that i can't print here .  phew !  stargate ========  lawrence of arabia meets star wars .  this epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else .  director roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on .  the film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history .  that said , there's still plenty to watch here .  sci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader .  he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that "" somebody else "" built the pyramids .  less interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame .  star trek generations =====================  trek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best .  the story is interesting , but each scene goes too long .  the cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch .  and so on .   ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii . )  original enterprise captain james t . kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead "" get a life . ""  remarkably unremarkable .  miracle on 34th street ======================  in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al , maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary .  john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original .  the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn't work too well , but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle .  his chemistry with children can moisten any eye .  no claus for alarm .  junior ======  arnold schwarzenegger pregnant ?  sure , billy crystal did it before in rabbit test , but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie .  what should be nothing more than a one-joke premise actually gets better as it goes along .  director ivan reitman ( dave , twins ) wisely keeps the farce to a minimum , so the first hour moves slower than you might expect .  don't expect too many yuks from danny devito , but you can't beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie .  how's * that * for a collision of acting styles ?

1|"for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies .  from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy .  but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves .  shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time .  sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a .  pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience .  no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul .  the excitement starts before the music even begins .  a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so .  there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick .  and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , "" finally , a decent sound system ! ""  you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street .  this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience .  it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain .  and while the lyrics to "" wild thing "" may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love .  even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats .  the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal .  all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time .  in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time .  for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating .  all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us .  the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in .  if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled .  it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore .  instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling .

1|"the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages .  martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime .  unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies .  seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime .  this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s .  goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) .  the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york .  at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands .  after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) .  three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history .  wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business .  but the perfect world of "" wiseguys "" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends .  goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory .  scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker .  world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating .  scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny .  after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens .  scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience .  with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era .  even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker .  first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue .  then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards .  this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation .  same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack .  nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s .  but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed .  however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people .  such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s .  fragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese .  he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious "" a day in life "" segment near the end of the film .  another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents .  the most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues .  joe pesci deserved his "" oscar "" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film .  ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film .  liotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs .  liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction .  lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband .  paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave .  as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time .  because of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s .

1|" "" the blair witch project "" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses .  its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted .  after the release of "" the blair witch project "" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch .  locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , "" get out of these woods and go home !  there is no goddamned blair witch ! "" .  jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage .  after he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet .  as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the "" blair witch hunt "" .  among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called "" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? "" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers .  the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying "" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . ""  this strange group plunges into the woods , where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience .  on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parr's abandoned house , strange things start happening .  when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain .  after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies .  they are somehow lost in time , as it loops uncontrollably back and forth .  they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality .  the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . .  documentary director joe berlinger ( "" paradice lost "" ) helms "" blair witch 2 "" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background .  the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand .  but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue .  in a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel .  more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail .  the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated .  of course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values .  from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( "" being john malkovich "" and "" fargo "" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with "" the blair witch project "" .   "" blair witch . . ""  was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation .  in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere .  with its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment .  and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor .  the key is simplicity .   "" blair witch project "" had a story which was incredibly simple .  that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination .  the film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares .  the effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way .   "" book of shadows "" feels incredibly controlled and restrict .  here , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and "" clever "" that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it .  there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with .  this is simply a less artistic film that doesn't have the talent and originality of its predecessor .  it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn't always succeed .  but most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn't allow it to destroy the original .  in the end , i can't call it a bad effort .  it's less artistic , not so scary and less original , but certainly not bad .  it's simply different .  in fact , if you haven't seen "" the blair witch project "" , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between "" the blair witch project "" and the "" scream "" -films .  the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism .  but it's a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making .  to me the story of "" the blair witch project "" seemed completed , but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that "" the book of shadows "" is certainly assured .  and it's already time to look forward to "" blair witch 3 "" .

1|seen may 31 , 1999 on home video ( rented ) .  one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise .  with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie .  there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there .  the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict .  the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist .  we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely .  later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right .  the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling .  this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone .  the man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him .  in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while .  but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story .  eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police .  we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time .  two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies .  it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film .  he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story .  but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo .  everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities .  however , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential .  by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax .  everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction .  but , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . '  for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) .  the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight .  at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then .  this premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard .  he does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form .  the aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not .  in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world .  however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is .  the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) .  for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending .  and that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense .  ironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world .  with `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message .  still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable .  there's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does .  the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years .  `dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world .  |0.6996666666666668|0.8333333333333334|0.8000000000000002|"The sentiment of the text is generally positive, with the author praising ""Dark City"" for its thought-provoking themes, beautifully constructed storytelling, and visual aesthetic.

1|"linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable .  she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith .  one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom .  he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it .  god would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again .  bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the "" prophets "" jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far .  at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) "" thirteenth apostle "" , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) .  it's a wild ride .  they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return .  loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates .  at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets .  it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , "" how corrupt are you ? "" .  wings of desire this ain't .  since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors .   ( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden . )  his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another .  dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition .  as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever .  any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack .  a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough .  because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time .  sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated .  like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker .  dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes !  smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan "" catholicism wow ! "" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished .  i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions .  proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever .  it's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma .  the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy .  there's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against .   ( not one of them had watched it . )  every single person refused .  smith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith .  in fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster .   ( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to .  now that's powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through .  it's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins .  my religion is movies .  when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid .  i therefore feel that , although i'm no bible-thumper , i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers .

1|"you've heard all the hype .  you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker .  if you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy .  you also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults .  believe the hype .  the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth .  but there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy .  the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters .  the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence .  he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out .  portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well .  amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) .  and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman .  however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job .  he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise .  in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film .  i would never call myself a "" star wars "" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america .  however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost .  for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine .  for those of you not recently steeped in "" star wars "" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in "" return of the jedi "" and "" empire strikes back . ""  so , obviously , his appearance in "" phantom menace "" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful .  a lot of the movie is like that .  r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . .  because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way .  same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy .  even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from "" empire strikes back "" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in "" star wars "" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing .  what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ?  the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty .  there's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be .  another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film .  i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters .  and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast .  unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive "" teenage mutant ninja turtles . ""  furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot .  oddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids .  well , he's done a good job .  the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy .  that's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him .  that's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader .  warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! !  in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film .  the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie .  he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine .  but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn .  his explanation ?   "" his future is clouded . ""   ( warning : major spoiler ahead .  enter at your own risk . )  of course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side .  this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup .  because qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself .  so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin "" darth vader "" skywalker .  did this story need to be told ?  i would say no .  but is it a worthwhile movie to see ?  absolutely .  if you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie .  the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation .  the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight .  and yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time .  above all , this is a fun movie .  not deep , not meaningful , and not profound .  but fun .  maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed "" empire "" will direct .  because if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential .   : )  "|-0.162|0.85|0.6666666666666666|The overall sentiment of the explanations is that the text has a slightly negative tone due to criticism of the movie's failure to live up to the first trilogy, stilted dialogue, distracting alien characters, and lack of foreshadowing for Anakin's future evil.

1|"as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film .  the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars .  to see these bars blocking his face , we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film .  as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin .  the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous .  this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds .  it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film .   "" in the heat of the night "" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america .  jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental .  in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers .  he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present .  preceding the very original "" a soldier's story "" and the recently released "" the hurricane , "" "" in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters .  the film , which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs , played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted .  tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him .  as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains , tibbs is the perfect protagonist .  poitier also gives an excellent , noteworthy voice to his character .  never nervous and always commanding , his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing .  however , unlike "" the hurricane "" where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast , poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger , who won best actor for his excellent performance .  as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him , steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role .  he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople .  he would refer to tibbs as "" boy "" and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him .  as the film progresses though , there is a very gradual change in the sheriff .  he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors .  what i really enjoyed about steiger's character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film .  he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil .  instead , it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future .  most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes .  this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day .  jewison's determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate .   "" in the heat of the night "" shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960's .  it displays this perfectly .  however , the actual investigation , although it is not the main focus of the film , lacks interest .  it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim .  there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) .  also , it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does , but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered .  the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic .   ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson .  he managed to be in the two best movies of 1967 , "" in the heat of the night "" and the even better "" in cold blood . "" )  "|0.7000000000000001|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|"The overall consensus from the explanations is that ""In the Heat of the Night"" is a powerful film that effectively portrays racism and societal corruption, with impressive performances from Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger. The film is commended for its powerful imagery and detailed depiction of racism, although some criticize the rushed ending and lack of focus on the investigation."
1|"in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance .  ever since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80's .  in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world .  you'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open .  in wonder boys his performance isn't showy or a tour de force , it's simple yet truthful .  he embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes .  grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map .  when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms .  grady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy .  their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for .  leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions .  he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges .  he's portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated .  he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) .  whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white .  leer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth .  tobey maguire fits well in the role .  with his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude .  but unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he's a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility .  katie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady's pants .  this is a plot line i had trouble with .  douglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions .  at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it's because i'm jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas's real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones .  seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping .  suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i'm pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas .  there is a movie in there somewhere .  grady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor .  okay , maybe not so chivalrous .  there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , "" she was a junkie for the printed word .  lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice "" .  robert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm .  downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual .  he's arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance .  the actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor .  i wish wonder boys had more of him .  searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that's part of its charm .  and maybe i'm a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i'm greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema .  everyone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to .  i'm privy to films about literary types i . e .  those individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch .  the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points .  sometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that's a problem i wish i found with films more often .  another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up .  for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags .  the gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do .  the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn't ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things .  curtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films .  he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up .  the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits .  the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen .  it's the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies .  many will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties .

1|"unzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi , an artist whose palette is fabric .  ostensibly , the film is a documentary , but use of that term requires stretching its meaning .  many scenes appear staged , and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room .  the cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium , and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) .  director douglas keeve ( who was mizrahi's lover at the time ) freely admits that he "" couldn't care less about the truth "" but was more interested in capturing "" the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion .

1|dora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station .  she , in her colorful demeanor , offers a service that is unheard of in the states .  she writes letters for the illiterate , who pass through , to try to find lost relatives , find love , or search after lost debts .  she+s quirky , she+s elderly , she+s caring .  totally trustworthy , right ?  not a chance .  once home , she never sends these letters , saving money on postage , and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) .  one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son , looking for their father .  shortly thereafter , she gets hit by a bus , and the son is orphaned .  days go by , and the boy , named josu ? , roams around the station , hungry , desperate , and somewhat clueless to his predictament .  through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon , dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father .  this means leaving the security of rio , traveling to the outskirts of brazil , where unpaved roads , religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace .  films like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films .  it is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world , so distant from my own .  it does so entertainingly , and so heart-wrenchingly .  and yet , it+s backdrop is merely that .  the focus is on the minute transformation of dora , of how she learns to love this little kid , without being cloying or sentimental .  the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film .  dora being an amoral scam-artist , could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals .  but neither side is trivialized .  she even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical , who sees the problems with dora , if not initially .  fernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance , but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira , who plays josu ? .  he , like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ ) , prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states .  he is a natural , and never once grating .  send a memo to jonathan taylor thomas .  |0.7333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|"The text provides a positive sentiment towards the film ""Central Station,"" praising its entertaining and heart-wrenching storytelling, transformation of the main character, and remarkable performances of Fernanda Montenegro and Vinicius de Oliveira, while also acknowledging some negative elements."
1|"the event of events is upon us .  people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it .  i don't think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused .  it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history .  anyone who tells you "" it's just a movie "" is either lying or clueless .  it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic .  the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated .  but that does not mean that the film itself is bad .  in fact , it is terrific .  i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash .  it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place .  the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation , angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small , peaceful planet of naboo .  the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as "" the force "" ) , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate .  unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur , the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene .  on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine , where they meet the movie's real focal point , young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) .  he is an innocent slave boy , but "" the force is strong with him "" so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi .  as any self-respecting star wars fan should know , anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker .  >from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actor's movie .  around 70% of the characters , if not more , are computer generated in one form or another , and though the effects are seamless , the movie lacks soul .  i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade , cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this .  this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far , with plenty of broad comic relief to go around , much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks .  he's essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like "" exqueeze me ? ""  and "" mesa go now , okeday ? "" , and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying .  the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph .  if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement .  the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh , come on , as if you didn't already know ) , among other things , is outrageously entertaining and defines the term "" popcorn movie "" .  what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams .  even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days , his work here is nothing short of brilliant .  his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling .  the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia .  when you see "" a long time ago , in a galaxy far , far away "" , when the familiar music plays , when the words "" star wars "" appear on screen , you'll feel a tingle even if you didn't see the movie when it first came out in '77 .  it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin , a boy whose innocence , we know , will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side .  it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good , but they do not .  we not only feel more involved in the story , but we feel like we're seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years .  the phantom menace , although lacking in human aspects of the story , is a very worthy installment in the star wars .  it works as an action flick , visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories , a piece of exquisite nostalgia .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  "|0.4083333333333334|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|The film is generally praised as a thrilling triumph with astounding visual effects and a brilliant score by John Williams, despite some flaws such as a lack of plot and acting.

""  with that piece of dialogue , we are fully introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey ) , a 42 year old man trapped within his own life .  lester works for an advertising agency .  his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering .  estranged from both his wife and his daughter , lester starts to crack under the stress .  his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies , and sullen apathy .  carolyn burnham ( annette bening ) , is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker .  she carefully tends her rose garden , decorates her home with the best furnishings .  but inside she is desperate .  unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent , she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family .  the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch ) , lester and carolyn's daughter .  a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence , but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction .  this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple .  not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her .  some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters .  most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney ) , the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts .  she has almost no dialogue , and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one .  colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man .  his rage directed almost singularly at his son , ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnham's .  in fact they are the next door neighbors .  anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in "" american beauty "" .  alan ball , who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series "" cybil "" and creator of the new sitcom "" oh grow up "" , has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years .  not one character in this film rings falsely .  and the depth of personality in each , is achingly honest and insightful .  the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as "" the graduate "" or "" lolita "" .  kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances .  his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age .  finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become , lester tries to return to his youth .  he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one year's salary ) , starts smoking pot , fantasizes about his daughter's girlfriend angela ( mena suvari , in a marvelous performance here ) , starts working out , and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet .  mr . spacey's performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous , that we can be certain that come oscar ? time , we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees .  annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career .  carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy .  unable to cope with her growing disillusionment , she forces herself to maintain her demeanor , driving her further and further into desperation , adultery and possibly murder .  ms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone .  the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words .  thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her .  jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family , and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment .  her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning .  she is the prototypical trophy child .  when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team ( "" i'm so proud of you , honey .  you didn't screw up once ! "" ) , the bitterness and resentment are palpable .  thora birch is a young actress to watch .  praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance .  colonel finn is a man in complete denial .  his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend .  wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma .  the boy next door who may be more foe than friend .  a deceitful and calculating young man , whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him .  mr . bentley's performance is the one troublesome note in the film .  that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar , that one almost faults the performance for it .  director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle .  scenes of carolyn walking through the rain , carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character .  the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful , capturing the season in all of it's harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting , yet depressing ) .  every nuance of "" american beauty "" begs it's audience to think and examine .  it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come .  and well it should , as it is simply one of this years best .

1|"if there's one thing in common about all of hollywood's major studios , it's that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more .  although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it's obvious there's no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater .  so when a movie like gary ross' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it's a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes .  although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie .  quite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen .  the story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema .  not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough .  kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture .  it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named "" pleasantville . ""  maguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times .  it's not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like .  soon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness .  at one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t .  walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town .  fine performances are turned in all around .  maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t .  walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) .  daniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman's envy .  for daniels , it's his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it's a complementary exclamation point on a fine career .  also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish .  there's not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don't .

"" .  in filming the well of souls sequence , the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on .  hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas .  however , once all the snakes were on set , it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them , so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths , and these were used as well .  looking closely , you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not .  an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra .  during his escape from the museum where it was housed , he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong .  also in the same script , indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence .  both of these scenes were cut from the script , but ended up in 1984's indiana jones and the temple of doom .  this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo .  the same type of opening is present in its sequels .  jock's airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number "" ob-cpo "" .  this is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas' star wars ( 9 . 5/10 ) .  also , the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po .  they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark .  the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip .  as legend has it , actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time , and asked if the scene could be shortened .  spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy .  the entire crew laughed and that's how it was filmed .  when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra , you can see the snake's reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford , also some fingerprints and stuff like that .  when indy is dragging along the ground , hanging onto the nazi soldier's truck with the ark inside , you can see the pad that he's being dragged on .

1|`we run tings .  tings don't run we . '  -sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) .  jamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) .  capone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him .  when he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) .  capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him .  torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again .  directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while .  shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are .  the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) .  the make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team .  the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest .  paul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times .  mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together .  unfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed .  the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) .  the end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review .  oddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us .  at the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) .  palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters .  chris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record .  overall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong .  if action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film .  the performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight .  i'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved .  |0.5|0.8333333333333334|0.8000000000000002|The film is positively reviewed for its efficient handling of shots and action scenes, superb cast performances, solid story, and entertaining homage to Hong Kong action films. Additionally, praise is given to the film's direction, soundtrack, make-up effects, and reggae music composed by Grammy award-winning artists. Overall, the sentiment of the explanations is positive.
1|"at first glance , it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds .  that's true of home alone 2 and i'd bet money that it's true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) .  but home alone actually has a lot going for it , and the cartoon slapstick doesn't get in the way .  the mcalisters , all 15 of them , are going to france for the holidays .  four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse .  the littlest kid , kevin , is the victim of the older kids' cruelty .  kevin's patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten , and he's going to have to starve .  he attacks his big bully brother buzz , who had been teasing him .  the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner , spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table , a few cousins , and an uncle .  the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin .  nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased , but they all point their fingers when he fights back .  the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine o'hara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night .  on his way up the stairs , he tells her that "" families suck "" and that he hopes never to see any of his family again .  that night the power goes out , knocking out the alarm clocks , so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport .  in a surprisingly plausible setup , kevin is mistakenly accounted for , and the family heads off without him .  it's interesting that , in a subtle way , his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children .  first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling , and second , they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class .  they're two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child .  meanwhile , kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true .  he's finally rid of his family !  life is a dream come true .  he can jump on the beds , watch r-rated movies , eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips , and dig through his big brother's secret box .  slowly , the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane .  he grooms himself , he does the laundry , he goes shopping ( "" i bought some milk , eggs , and fabric softener "" ) .  he also starts to miss his family , not just for their company , but for the security they bring .  the furnace in the basement is a scary monster , the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer , and two crooks are trying to break into his house .  macaulay culkin is cute but he isn't much of an actor .  still , we can see that kevin's character grows , thanks to some good direction and editing .  for example , acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night , just as "" santa "" is getting in his car .  kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa .  he learned how to deal with the furnace .  you turn on the lights and it's not so scary anymore .  he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer , who actually turns out to be a nice man .  they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid .  finally , in the last 20 minutes , kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits , head on ( literally ) .  this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick , and after the movie's genuine dramatic setup , it is dessert .  it's a lot of fun , and it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the movie .  on the whole , home alone is a great holiday movie .  john williams' original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls , and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings .  but it does have its flaws .  the smallest problem is that culkin doesn't act very well .  as i said before , he is cute , but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkin's insight into his character .  the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda , the villains threaten kevin's life about five times .  instead of "" i'm gonna get that kid "" they say "" i'm gonna kill that kid . ""  some might argue that the tone is the same , but i strongly disagree .  mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas .  i'll probably never see home alone 3 , and i wish i had skipped home alone 2 , but i do enjoy home alone almost every year .  don't let your impressions of the others detract from the original , which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick .

1|-- comedy , rated pg , runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman , kathy moriarty , and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass --  summary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant !  to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis .  he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town .  we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them .  quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee .  the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely .  unlike many comedies this film tries , and succeeds , in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh .  the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story .  the performances of all the principals are right on the mark , particularly john goodman as the schlock master .  so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted , yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours .  longer , more detailed review : [beware of spoilers]  the primary reason i enjoyed this film was , that while being a comedy , the film also had an intelligent story to tell .  too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh .  you watch the movie , laugh a lot , leave the theatre and take nothing with you .  matinee is not like that .  i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis .  i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film .  but most importantly , i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters .  the comedy of the film centers around goodman , his character , and the film he brings to key west .  i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today .  he is highly expressive both physically and vocally .  i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink .  the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature , however , while the star , goodman is actually not at the center of the film .  the movie is really the story of the four teenagers , discovering who they are and what they want , against a background where at any minute it could all end .  i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic .  they tried to block it out , they tried to escape from the concerns of their world .  unfortunately it kept creeping back in , particularly with the fear , and the chaos of the time .  while the comedy centered on goodman , and the drama on the teens , there was a great deal of overlap .  several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light .  one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store .  if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy , but it works here .  another reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies .  one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space .   ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies , but one of my favorite to see . )  while mant !  never got made , many films like it were , and mant !  serves mostly as dante's homage to the b-films he loves .  so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good , humorous story .  this isn't a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent , well-thought out , film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way .  enjoy !  |0.8233333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.9333333333333332|"The overall sentiment towards the film ""Matinee"" is positive, as the reviewer enjoys the mixture of comedy and tension, appreciates the intelligent storytelling and performances of the actors, and highly recommends it for a light-hearted yet interesting experience."
1|when _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago , the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image .  when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars , we see constellations , meteor showers , and cool space-ships .  when han solo goes light speed , the stars change to bright lines , going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point .  cool .  _october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot , traveling horizontally across the night sky .  was it really only forty years ago , when sputnik was launched , and that before then , no satellites ever existed ?  have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement , even though it was from the russians ?  it sounds hokey , but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_ , i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam , played by jake gyllenhaal .  determined to make a dent in the space race , he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them .  it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket .  when lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern ) , suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair , we know exactly who is going to win .  but the joy in a film like this is in the little details .  for example , homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class .  if he has any strengths whatsoever , it is an undeterring vision , and a good organizer .  it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school , who knows more about rocket science than he does .  it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is , the entire coal-mining town ) , he must walk eight miles one way , just to set up the rockets , which will fail , fail , fail , and fail again .  homer+s dad is played by chris cooper , a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ .  here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies , he is the head of the coal-miners , who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions .  this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is .  he is his son+s last nemesis , as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams .  but he truly loves his son , and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how .  through coal-mining .  because of his character , we can see how far we+ve come .  the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us .  we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family .  the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet , and he knew of no other life .  so _october sky_ , far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film , offers much food for thought .  and this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you .  btw , the final image of the film is just as simple , is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background .  another commonplace image , to be sure , but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago .  |0.5666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|"The overall sentiment of the text is mildly positive, with mentions of excitement in space exploration and positive expressions about the film ""October Sky,"" but also acknowledging some negative aspects such as failed rocket launches."
1|warning : contains what the matrix is .  rated r for sci-fi violence .  starring : keanu reeves , laurence fishburne , joe panteliano  some may be disappointed with the matrix .  i'll tell you i was .  i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen .  now wait wait , i know most of you loved it , and i'm not saying i didn't like it .  what i'm saying is the first half was extremely slow .  now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show .  don't be fooled , this movie has a big story .  and big chunks of talky moments .  but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par , deserving the rating above .  ok now to the story .  well this may take a while .  ok first of all , our world we live in now , is not the real world , actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix .  a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out , when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world .  he does so , and finds out that he can do anything , be anything he wants to be .  but he has to fight a 'matrix skipping' bad guy , who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him .  laurence fishburne , his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves .  but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were .  yeah there were some in the first half but not enough .  the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie .  now for the second half , it is explosive , and saves the movie .  some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking .  the sound , the music , and all the effects were effective , and the last hour kept us entertained .  but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes , this movie is at least 40 minutes too long .  one would have wished for a better 'matrix' , but i do have to say , i did like it and i was entertained .  |-0.06666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|0.7833333333333333|The reviewer had mixed sentiments about the movie, expressing disappointment with the slow first half and misrepresentation in the trailer, but acknowledging impressive performances and special effects in the second half.
