0|"1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject , or , to be precise , same "" high concept "" .  in summer 1994 , that "" high concept "" was "" mad bomber action thriller "" .  in few weeks , "" thrillride of the summer "" actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away , so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes .  the movie begins in the prison in northern ireland , where gaerity ( tommy lee jones ) , ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material , escapes from prison .  he comes to boston , where he accidentally notices jimmy dove ( jeff bridges ) , dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police .  few people except gaerity know the dove's violent past , when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence , betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose .  gaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror , directed specifically at dove's colleagues , friends and relatives .  dove , who is just going to retire and start family , now must confront the mad bomber .  while speed doesn't even try to bother with plot and characters , using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes , blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story .  and that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed .  badly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all .  screenplay by john bateer and john rice , barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland , using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama .  the plot is , of course , full of implausibilities .  the main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual , no matter how brilliant he is , can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay .  those questions , same as in the case of speed , could be forgotten while the action goes on , but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters .  because of them , movie seems a little bit too long , and boring at times .  the most annoying element of the film , however , is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber .  his acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself .  this role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive .  the film have few bright points , though .  some of the action scenes are fine , which should be credited to director stephen hopkins ( predator ii , judgement night ) .  and forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove's colleague .  but , all in all , blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous , yet hardly unforgettable competitor .

0|"don't get me wrong -- i tend to appreciate besson's naive , unashamedly romantic worldview , an artsy european sensibility gone thoroughly hollywood .  his 1994 leon is exciting and absurdly moving , thanks mainly to the interplay between jean reno and a young natalie portman , and 1997's the fifth element is a goofy paean to love , l-u-v , that's even more of a hoot on repeated viewings .  but his joan of arc is a mess , despite some stirring battle scenes and the mostly knockout presence of a close-cropped milla jovovich as the maiden herself .  jovovich , besson's own personal muse through the making of his last two films ( though they've since separated ) , is magnetic and energetic enough to play a credible joan ( as long as you believe joan was not just a warrior , but also a fabulous , supermodel-level babe ) .  and besson remains a servicable action film director , though not an especially facile one .  leading her army against the seemingly impenetrable fortresses of the english , joan's struggle against great odds is undeniably stirring , and besson helps you understand how the french could believe , fervently , that god is on her side .  besson's big mistake , i think , is trying to dramatize the interior life of his subject .  yes , joan had visions -- but i guarantee that whatever image a sympathetic audience conjures in its collective mind will be more compelling than the blue-eyed christ figure on display in besson's hallucinatory dream sequences .  the whole conceit turns into a disaster right about the time dustin hoffman ( billed as "" the conscience "" ) shows up , spouting platitudes and sending poor milla running around her cell , babbling like ally mcbeal .  that's kind of a shame , since she does quite well up to that point , charging into battle with a banshee wail that suggests the eruption of a sublimated bloodthirstiness .  that darkly attractive aspect of her character -- that she's as likely a charismatic madwoman as the vessel of the lord -- is more or less betrayed by the final reels , in which the conscience browbeats her over the killing she's overseen and joan starts to look like little more than a very confused young lady who's about to take a fall .  as the story winds down , with joan condemned to a horrible death by fire , besson is aiming for tragedy and psychological significance .  trouble is , he's chosen a lurid , often jokey tone for the balance of the picture -- including some blithe cgi bloodshed in the battle scenes -- and it's impossible to shake the feeling that this particular vision of the middle ages is , to a great extent , nothing more than a put-on .  this glib , pre-fab version of such a great story makes me all the more grateful for dreyer's the passion of joan of arc ( 1928 ) , a film whose dialogue is drawn from the actual transcripts of joan's trial , and which stands as one of the most harrowing experiences in all of cinema .  compared to that film , the messenger plays as a crime against history .  -------------------------------------------------------------- directed by luc besson written by besson and andrew birkin cinematography by thierry arbogast music by eric serra starring milla jovovich france/usa , 1999  theatrical aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 --------------------------------------------------------------  "|0.27133333333333337|0.7666666666666666|0.7166666666666667|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is mixed, leaning towards positivity, as the reviewers appreciate Luc Besson's romantic worldview and the interplay between actors in his previous films, but criticize his film ""Joan of Arc"" for its portrayal of the main character and the tone of the movie."

0|"it's a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise .  the movie is lacking and most unsatisfying .  osmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there's something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt .  not that there's anything wrong with scatology .  i bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was .  it's merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable .  you can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn .  osmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho .  the trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen-age audience may find it too tame for their tastes .  adults ? well , let's just say most will find it unappetizing .  osmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby .  the live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe .  he continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower .  frank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast-food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you .  he works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does .  frank's body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard-boiled egg that had fallen to the ground .  it's not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth .  nope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate's mouth .  like i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one .  after ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences .  here , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier's david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) .  basically , what we have is a cliched cop-buddy movie , rife with all the clich ? s of that genre .  and this is why osmosis jones doesn't click .  it merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations .  the jokes and puns are lame : osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus .  after pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , "" funny , he doesn't look fluish . ""  and the jokes don't rise above that level .  the live action scenes are no better .  frank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child .  he's almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters .  osmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left .  the animation is rather two-dimensional and flat .  it lacks scope and depth .  it is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater .

0|"i had been looking forward to this film since i heard about it early last year , when matthew perry had just signed on .  i'm big fan of perry's subtle sense of humor , and in addition , i think chris farley's on-edge , extreme acting was a riot .  so naturally , when the trailer for "" almost heroes "" hit theaters , i almost jumped up and down .  a soda in hand , the lights dimming , i was ready to be blown away by farley's final starring role and what was supposed to be matthew perry's big breakthrough .  i was ready to be just amazed ; for this to be among farley's best , in spite of david spade's absence .  i was ready to be laughing my head off the minute the credits ran .  sadly , none of this came to pass .  the humor is spotty at best , with good moments and laughable one-liners few and far between .  perry and farley have no chemistry ; the role that perry was cast in seems obviously written for spade , for it's his type of humor , and not at all what perry is associated with .  and the movie tries to be smart , a subject best left alone when it's a farley flick .  the movie is a major dissapointment , with only a few scenes worth a first look , let alone a second .  perry delivers not one humorous line the whole movie , and not surprisingly ; the only reason the movie made the top ten grossing list opening week was because it was advertised with farley .  and farley's classic humor is widespread , too .  almost heroes almost works , but misses the wagon-train by quite a longshot .  guys , let's leave the exploring to lewis and clark , huh ?  stick to "" tommy boy "" , and we'll all be "" friends "" .

0|"the original babe gets my vote as the best family film since the princess bride , and it's sequel has been getting rave reviews from most internet critics , both siskel and ebert sighting it more than a month ago as one of the year's finest films .  so , naturally , when i entered the screening room that was to be showing the movie and there was nary another viewer to be found , this notion left me puzzled .  it is a rare thing for a children's movie to be praised this highly , so wouldn't you think that every parent in the entire city would be flocking with their kids to see this supposedly "" magical "" piece of work ?  a tad bewildered , but pleased to not have to worry about screaming kids and other disruptions that commonly go along with family films , i sat back for 97 minutes and watched intently and with a very open mind , having great expectations for the film .  looking back , i should have taken the hint and left right when i entered the theater .  believe me ; i wanted to like babe : pig in the city .  the plot seemed interesting enough ; after the events that took place in the original , babe the sheep-pig has become a legitimate national phenomenon .  but after a fateful encounter with a water well , arthur hogget ( james cromwell , who the movie could have used alot more of ) has been rendered bed-ridden for a number of weeks and the farm begins to go under financially .  the only solution that his wife ( magda szubanski , going from delightfully charming to downright annoying ) can come up with is to make an appearance with their new celebrity pet at a national fair ( i think ) and to use the money they earn to pay off the bank ( set aside for the moment the fact that they could get more than enough cash from donations if they just made their case known to the public ) .  problem is , the fair is being held in the middle of the dreaded "" city "" , a completely foreign place to both the pig and his companion .  setting the main plot in motion , mrs . hogget and babe travel to the unnamed city and shack up with a sweet lady who just happens to love to help animals , despite the law that you cannot keep them in hotels .  it is here that we meet an array of eccentric characters , the most memorable being the family of chimps led by steven wright .  here is where the film took a wrong turn .  up until this point , i had being having a rather enjoyable experience .  the beginning featured some smart writing and funny situations involving the farm animals from the first one and even an inspired moment at the airport where mrs . hogget is accused of smuggling drugs .  unfortunately , the story wears thin as we are introduced to a new set of animals that reside at the hotel , none of them being even one-tenth as interesting as the characters from the previous babe .  the main topic of discussion surrounding babe : pig in the city is the question of whether or not it is to dark and disturbing for small children , and i believe it is .  at one point , a dog is hung from his neck and slowly starts to drown .  at other times , we are treated to surrealistic flash-backs to mrs . hogget's full cavity search at the airport .  in fact , the overall tone of the movie is rather bleak and depressing .  however , that is , as they say , neither here nor there because kids will probably not like the movie anyway .  the animal characters and their plights were simply not intriguing enough to sustain my interest for an hour and a half , let alone entertain a child .  another problem i found with the film was it's sudden change of pacing and tone near the end of the story .  if you're going to make a darker and more sinister sequel , fine .  it may not be my cup of tea , but at least it is a noble ambition .  but to go from the downbeat feel of the rest of the movie and all of a sudden have slapstick finale with mrs . hogget swinging from wall-to-wall of a ballroom in elastic overalls ?  it just didn't feel right and was more painful to watch than it was funny or entertaining , and the same goes for the rest of the movie .

0|i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick .  take the professional , for example .  it boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions .  it's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension .  the professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant .  the professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated .  one day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door .  her name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a .  agent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off .  leon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother .  the two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both .  writer/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin .  there is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting .  but beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe .  the relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop .  leon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies .  jean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda .  natalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either .  besson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing .  a silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag .  gary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch .  there isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more .  a more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way .  there were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely .  but besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing .  this is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty .  a great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact .  |-0.6|0.8333333333333334|0.7333333333333334|"The overall sentiment is negative towards the movie ""The Professional"" due to its criticism of unpleasant elements, lack of character development, distasteful treatment of a relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl, focus on violence, cheap titillation, feeble attempts at humor, and sleazy nature."
0|"one of these days , i'll make good on my promise never to rent another abel ferrara movie .  king of new york and body snatchers notwithstanding ( and bad lieutenant is only fit for a single , emotive viewing ) , his exploitation flicks have fallen into a rut of hoary art-house trappings .  it's a perfume-drenched , coke-addled visit to the seedy pornography shop , where beautiful models ( no , hookers -- no , courtesans ) usher you through the silk curtains .  ferrara's only consistently smart move has been casting christopher walken over and over again , since walken can make a good movie great and a loathsome movie durable whenever he's onscreen .  his 8-minute scene in the addiction is the saving grace of that otherwise abysmal , unwatchable , and pretentious failure .  when he starts talking about his vampiric bowel movements , or questions whether lili taylor has ever read naked lunch , there's a much-needed dose of humor in an otherwise terminally unfunny affair .  you know those gothic club kids who are too cool to smile and let you know they're actually having fun ?  the addiction is that movie .  walken , sadly , does not appear in the blackout .  the central role of matty , a junkie film star whose lightning paced hollywood life among the beautiful people is inevitably leading to his destruction , is played by matthew modine ( who takes what he can get after cutthroat island ) .  much like the protagonists of michelangelo antonioni's terminally bored cultural elite , matty is involved in a bitter pill "" relationship "" with high fashioned model annie ( at least i think she's a model . )  matty's lady is played by french actress b ? atrice dalle , arrested twice for cocaine possession during filming of the blackout -- not that you needed to know that , but it lends credence to the idea that ferrara's entire oeuvre has been filmed in a fucking blackout .  no kidding .  requiem for a dream has nothing on the junkie presentations seen in ferrara's movies and his controversial urban lifestyle .  matty and annie struggle over her decision to have an abortion without consulting him .  no doubt , he was off chasing the dragon .  in his despair , matty indulges in a chemical induced weekend of debauchery , tooling around the streets of miami with video filmmaker mickey wayne ( dennis hopper , in full "" dirty ol' man "" mold smacking models on the ass and telling them to spread their legs .  wider ! )  toward the end of the night , they pick up a teenage waitress also named annie ( sarah lassez ) , start shooting a hastily improvised sexual scene , then matty thankfully blacks out .  something happened that night which haunts him throughout the rest of the movie , and it's exactly what you think it was .  suffice to say , there's some confusion over whether he killed annie one or annie two , or anyone at all .  the blackout is typical ferrara : no plot to speak of , plenty of raunch , and horribly vogue images of matthew modine downing a bottle of jack daniels and a beer while wrapping himself in a see-through curtain in his hotel room by the sea , by the sea , by the beautiful sea .  cinematographer ken kelsch finds inconsistent glory in alternating gorgeous painterly sunsets with docu-style sleaze ( and we're back to dennis hopper leering at girls in bathing suits .   "" yeah ! ! !  yeah ! ! !  arrrghhh ! ""  says mr . hopper .  dirty old sod . )  it's compulsive viewing in a tacky sort of way , leading to a ridiculous climax where modine seizes control of his destiny .  how's that for cryptic ?  never fear -- ferrara finds time for some female full frontal nudity to remind us what he's all about .  i can picture it now .

[he was in that scene ?  -ed . ]  here , he's asked to let it all hang out , sporting a three-day stubble and oily bangs .  he throws around furniture like stanley kowalski , but it's somehow lacking .  modine lacks the feral intensity of brando , entirely miscast in ferrara's flesh fair .  better luck next time , matt .  someday , you'll be forgiven for cutthroat island , which wasn't really your fault in the first place .  maybe atom egoyan will find a place for you somewhere , and all will once again be well in your world .

0|"whenever u . s . government starts meddling into other countries' affairs , under the pretext of supporting human rights or preventing political , religious or ethnic persecution , the other side is ready to use mantra that says "" look who's talking !  what have you done to the indians ? ""  however , even the americans themselves are ready to use that dark chapter of their own national history when it suits their purposes .  hollywood is just another example , with its revisionist westerns , made in early 1990s .  those movies tried to exploit the emerging wave of political correctness , coinciding with the 500th anniversary of columbus' discovery of america .  one of such examples is geronimo : an american legend , 1993 western directed by walter hill , film that deals with one of the last conflicts between american natives and white settlers .  the hero of the film is geronimo ( played by wes studi ) , leader of apaches , fierce warrior tribe that used to give hard time to white settlers during the second half of 19th century .  when the movie begins , in 1885 , geronimo and his apaches made peace with u . s . government and try to live peacefully in arizona reservation .  however , broken promises , injustice and violence against his people would make geronimo restless .  with not more 30 or so of his followers , he escapes reservation and begins guerrilla campaign .  general crook ( gene hackman ) , commander of u . s . army forces , respects geronimo and knows that even his 5 , 000 force isn't enough to catch geronimo in the great spaces of the american southwest .  instead , he turns to people who are more experienced with apaches - lt . charles gatewood ( jason patric ) and indian hunter al sieber ( robert duvall ) .  together with young lt . britton davis ( matt damon ) they would begin mission aimed at capturing geronimo .  geronimo : an american legend , like many movies made under the shadow of political correctness , try to tell the tale about oppressed minorities , but instead the real subject is the bad conscience of the oppressors .  so , the story about geronimo is told from the perspective of his enemies .  almost all of them happen to be his greatest admirers and use every opportunity to express how sorry they feel for having to fight him and his people .  although such elements of john millius' screenplay do indeed have some basis in history , they harm the story of geronimo .  to be honest , walter hill does try to make geronimo the real hero of the film , but the movie segments that deal with the plight of apaches and the uprising are given too little time .  instead , they turn out to be nothing more than the back story for rather uninteresting adventure story of gatewood and his band .  to make even worse , hill has some real problems with pacing and style , and in the end we have impression that we are watching two films badly edited into one - story about geronimo and story about his pursuers .  the movie should have been better if it turned to geronimo's life before and after his last uprising , in many ways more interesting than the story about gatewood .  the difference between those segments could be observed through the different quality of acting .  wes studi , cherokee actor who was so impressive as magua in the last of the mohicans , was perfect choice for geronimo , not only because he resembles geronimo , but because he induces a lot of passion in his role .  contrary to him , we have disinterested actors who sleepwalk through the roles of his white enemies .  while this could be expected from someone like jason patric , it is shame when we have veterans like gene hackman or robert duvall .  even hill's directing is bellow expectations - battle scenes are too short and , like in many of his late films , force viewers to ask what had happened to the great action director of 1970s .  even his old associate , music composer ry cooder , disappoints , with the score that shifts between indian motives and classic .  on the other hand , photography by lloyd ahern ii , with the use of red lenses , gives somewhat dreamy atmosphere , ideal for this movie that was supposed to be melancholic epic .  all in all , compared with some of the hollywood's examples of political correctness , this film isn't so bad , but we are left with the unpleasant impression that it could have been better .

""  with the millenium just around the corner , hollywood is playing with our insecurities concerning the biggest event of this century .  this time it is arnold schwartzenegger against the powers of evil .  the result is somewhat predictable .  i didn't have high hopes about arnold's "" much anticipated "" return to the big screen .  schwarzenegger fans will probably be pleased , action lovers won't be bored , and the catholic league will be angry .  everyone else will see 'end of days' for what it is : a deliciously bad motion picture .  think of it as hollywood's own y2k bug .  did you know that if you turn the three diabolical numbers 666 you'll get 999 , as in 1999 ?  yes , you better believe it . . satan is here on earth , working on his latest project -- the end of days .  this time it is gabriel burne who gets the privilege to play lucifer and , although not al pacino , he is fun to behold .  he coolly strolls through manhattan in the borrowed body of an investment banker , wreaking , as they say , havoc .  the way it works is he smirks and something explodes .  before the stroke of the new millennium he's got to find and impregnate a certain woman in order to climb out from under a heavenly curse as spelled out in the book of revelations .  only schwarzenegger's cop attached to an anti-terrorist unit can stop him .  films like this has one serious weakness -- logic .  no matter how you twist the "" plot "" , you'll find it incredibly stupid ( even for a schwartzenegger movie ! ) .  the incredible fact is that such directors never learn .  after thousands of headless productions , this theme has become one big clich ? .  here the devil looks more like a sex addicted maniac that has just got out of a mental institution .  he is walking around n . y . , blowing everything up and killing everyone that gets in a 5 meter radius .  all he wants is the girl , that is somehow special .  but schwartzenegger is more clever than he looks , he has hidden her in a church , where satan dare not enter .  so the evil one is forced to seduce the good cop in order to get the valuable information : "" you can have your wife and daughter back . . i  can give you happiness that you can only dream of . . just  give me the address . . ""  indeed with a script like that , you could make a wonderful parody , but unfortunately the director is taking this subject very seriously , attempting to create a provoking an dramatic thriller .  and for you who have awaited arnold swartzenegger's comeback , will not be very satisfied .  we've not seen him in a while .  that's because he didn't have a worthy opponent .  he has battled nuclear terrorists on earth and power mad conspirators on mars .  he has taken on alien predators in the darkest reaches of the jungle and morphing cyberkillers that seemingly nothing can stop .  so , after all those fights , what's left for arnold schwarzenegger ?  how about satan ?  in my opinion , he has never quite overcome his first role as the deadly robot in cameron's "" terminator "" .  and that is schwartzenegger's strength -- muscles and no emotions .  here he tries to achieve an artistic level , moving towards the oscar .  this is called "" an adult turn "" if successful and "" a flop "" if unsuccessful .  make a wild guess !  his character has lost his wife and daughter and has serious drinking problems .  this requires at least some acting skills .  regrettably , the only thing convincing about old arnold is his muscles .  the rest of the cast are struggling with their so called characters .  the movie is otherwise technically impressive , with a solid cinematography and fine lighting .  but the movie doesn't serve neither as a serious thriller ( because of its stupidity ) nor as comic entertainment ( because of its serious tone ) .  the only real comic relief in this film is when swartzenegger tries to cry .  the action sequences are all recycled and the effects are everything but spectacular .  so i really have a hard time recommending this film to somebody .  unless you are a die-hard schwartzenegger fan , stay away .  as for schwarzenegger , he'll be back .

0|"these days , people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run .  1970s nostalgia is already wearing off , and now , people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s .  few years in the future , early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia .  however , i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period .  one of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon's loaded weapon 1 , that , in many ways , symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas .  being made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series , this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge , and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson ) , by-the-book policeman , days away from retirement .  two of them , following the murder of luger's ex- partner , must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies .  the authors of this films ( whose director , gene quintano , worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects , and that reflects in the lack plot , characters , and , even original lines .  the plot , or what goes for the plot in this movie , is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series , this film "" borrows "" its female lead from basic instinct ) .  the best gags , are , same as with many other similar movies , shown in the trailers .  the rest simply doesn't work .  only those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh .  others would probably wince at the lameness of humour .  some would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while .  but , at the end , spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort .  the film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones .  the authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel .

0|"paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i'd consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who's managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils .  starship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that's nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage .  it's not a completely successful film , but as a failure it's certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one .  my favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven't yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) .  i believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that's as touching as schwarzenegger's in t2 .  that movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics .  its violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience .  there's a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him .  he tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim's every fearful tic .  it's a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir .  in hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won't shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on .  but why ?  his character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who's always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster .  the kind who just won't die .  hollow man's protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who's saddled with the film's worst lines ( "" i've lost cohesion again ! "" ) .  they're a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w . bush's republican national convention speech ( i . e .  bush referring to clinton ; "" ? ? ? so much promise ? ? ? but to what end ?  to what end ? "" --  this actually got applause !  suddenly warren beatty doesn't look so absurd ) .  the rest of the film's characters are all well past thirty , though act like annoying high school party animals insulting one and other with a series of strained one-liners ; is it just me or have labored insults become big budget hollywood's new character developing technique ?  ahh , what a cynical time we live in ? ? ?  as the picture opens we meet cain ( kevin bacon ) , an egocentric scientist working with the crew of aforementioned irritating scientists on a top secret ( so top secret the government has only provided them with a dilapidated warehouse in which to perform their extensive experimentation's ) project with the goal to make invisibility a possibility ( for what purpose is never hinted at ) .  they've performed several experiments on animals and have nearly solved the quandary causing caine , in a twist worthy of the film's 1950's late show origins , to impulsively experiment on himself .  caine neglects to let the pentagon in on his plans and somehow gets two of his co-workers to lie for him so the rest of the crew will think the pentagon gave the go ahead .  our mad scientist is turned invisible ( after several fx-heavy complications ) , then he inexplicably ( it's hinted that the process of invisibility has made the animals into more savage creatures , but this is never explored , and if that was the case why the hell would anyone be stupid enough to test this out on a human ? )  begins raping , assaulting and murdering anyone he pleases , always with a lame wisecrack ready a la freddy krueger .  it grows abundantly clear with each new release that it's verhoeven's films that have become hollow .  like the rest , this one is cold , heartless , and full of contempt for humanity , but in addition to all that it lacks any trace of wit , insight and makes no statement other than "" audiences will pay for anything these days "" .  it's an affront to anyone looking for something stimulating on an intellectual level , or even those hoping to spend a saturday night with a fun , thrill-a-minute ride .  verhoeven has instead served up an utterly routine mad slasher flick with nobody to root for and no reason to care .  the previews make hollow man look like an irresistible flick .  how can one not have a good time at a film that utilizes state of the art fx to illustrate an invisible man getting down and dirty with his bad self ?  a couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability .  hollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot .  but oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway .  verhoeven delivers the sleazy "" goods "" , but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner , here it just feels icky and uncomfortable .  the director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses , caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background .  it's plainly obvious that verhoeven isn't exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well .  it's funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman's naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand .  most vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks .  in fact it's largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since , by the end , most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat .  as in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre ) , and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked .  the film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy .  it happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens , who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon , suddenly pauses .   "" are you looking at me ? "" , she queries , obviously haunted .  it's a little moment in a big film with nothing to offer but ground breaking special effects set to a plot that should have run its course by 1982 ( the apex of the mad slasher craze ) .  those special effects are so stunning they alone keep this from being as bad as urban legend or i still know what you did last summer .  and they're the only reason to check out hollow man , preferably as a mid-week bargain rental .  you've been warned .  but you probably won't listen , will you ?  tis' a pity ? ? ?

0|fact that charles bronson represents one of the most important movie icons of the 1980s represents one of the biggest and almost tragic ironies of that decade .  tragedy lies in the fact that the icon status was earned less by quality of his work in movies , but the quantity .  most of those movies were produced by cannon group , company led by israeli producers menahem golan and yoram globus .  those two men probably thought that they could be the next roger corman , b- movie mentors of future hollywood legends .  unfortunately , that didn't happened , and when cannon finally went bankrupt at the end of the decade , behind it stood the huge pile of cinematic garbage , that would require at least few centuries before it reaches the camp appeal .  sadly for bronson , that garbage also contained numerous movies in which that capable character actor and action hero of the 1970s tried to raise their worth simply by being the main lead , and lowering his own reputation in process .  on the other hand , bronson could take comfort in a fact that those movies were extremely popular , especially among the audience 3 or 4 times younger than bronson himself .  one of such movies that seriously marred bronson's reputation is death wish 3 , third sequel in the series which began with death wish in 1974 .  in the original movie , bronson played paul kersey , mild-mannered new york architect who turns into deadly street vigilante after his family fell victim to urban violence .  that movie was far from masterpiece ; yet , in it the director michael winner was skillfully offering the cinematic remedy for very real disease of growing crime rates of the time ( on the same lines like siegel in dirty harry ) .  unfortunately , six years later cannon group got rights to the character of paul kersey and began destroying it by pumping out sequels ; even the presence of its original director didn't stop the rapid decline of the quality .  death wish 3 begins when kersey comes to visit an old friend , living in the urban wasteland of east new york , populated by young criminals and people too old or too poor to move out .  before the reunion , kersey's friend falls victim to the street gang led by evil fraker ( played by gavan o'herlihy , probably the only noteworthy role in the film ) .  kersey decides to avenge his death and slowly prepares for his crusade , while the police inspector shriker ( ed lauter ) , ants to use him as a secret weapon in his losing war against the urban crime .  bronson , the main asset in this movie , plays the character who is nothing more than an efficient killing machine .  although bronson's charisma does help in overcoming some implausibilities ( single man in his 60s and armed with a single pistol manages to wipe out dozens of opponents with superior firepower ) , the lack of emotions or bronson's own commitment could be seen in a very few lines spoken in a film .  the movie authors were somewhat aware of that emotional shallowness , so they added romantic interest for their hero - public defender played by deborah raffin and conveniently terminated in order to give some more motives for kersey's crusade .  on the other hand , emotions are much better played by confronting law-abiding , yet ethnically stereotyped citizens with their daily nemesis of street punks - ruthless enough to exercise their reign of terror on the entire city blocks , and stupid enough to be killed in droves by kersey .  unfortunately , michael winner doesn't know how to work out the plot , and after torturing the viewers with mostly uninteresting characters and cliched and formulaic situations , ends this movie with a bang .  the big showdown at the end - that turns east new york into the sarajevo-like battle zone - is probably the worst part of the movie , because of the poor editing and the cheap sets and props that give away the low budget .  in short , this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical charles bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia .   ( special note for trekkies : marina sirtis , the actress who played counsellor deanna troi in star trek : the next generation could be spotted in a small role of portorican wife ) .  |-0.5666666666666668|0.8000000000000002|0.7333333333333334|"The text has a negative sentiment as it discusses the decline and degradation of Charles Bronson's reputation, the poor quality of his movies, particularly ""Death Wish 3"", and how the quantity over quality approach tarnished his iconic status.

0|"overblown remake of the 1963 robert wise film of the same name ( based on shirley jackson's novel "" the haunting of hill house "" ) stars lili taylor as one of three "" lab rats "" that participate in a supposed "" insomnia "" study being initiated by liam neeson .  he is actually conducting a study on the causes of fear and why the human mind is still affected by it .  he drags the test subjects out to a foreboding mansion where all types of "" creepy "" cgi effects scare the cast and try the audience's patience .  i know this question has been posed before , but why do people keep remaking good movies ?  the original was a great psychological horror film .  this new version is dull and very decidedly not scary .  in fact , i feel it is downright impossible to make a modern day pg-13 horror movie that is scary .  unless you find obvious computer generated special effects frightening , then there's nothing in this film that will raise hackles .  i nearly fell asleep twice during the film , and probably would have if they guy two rows behind me didn't seem to have such a personal relationship with the characters that he felt he needed to discuss every decision they made with them as the film progressed .  it's sad to see such an amazing cast wasted so badly .  owen wilson spends most of the film wandering the halls of the house , and the script does no justice to his wonderful comic ability .  catherine zeta-jones ( always nice to look at ) is given the woefully underwritten role of a bi-sexual insomniac that gets to run out of her bedroom perplexed every time some strange noise occurs .  liam neeson pops in from time to time to talk into his tape recorder and attempt to convince the others that he has as much knowledge about what's going on as the rest of them do .  finally , poor lili taylor , the center of the film , gets the brunt of the cgi effects thrown at her while everyone else gets to scream and try to rescue her .  apparently , a subplot involving a tryst between zeta-jones and taylor's characters was filmed but removed .  that's too bad , because it might have lent some better characterization to the narrative .  this is jan de bont's second straight misfire ( speed 2 : cruise control being the first ) .  when is he going to learn that bigger is not always necessarily better ?  robert wise knew that when he made the original and the makes of the blair witch project also knew that .  one should not approach a haunted house movie with a twister mindset .  if de bont and screenwriter david self had let our minds fill in the blanks as to what was happening instead of showing us everything , it would have served to make the film terrifying .  what our mind fashions on it's own can be a thousand times more frightening than having having it completely led towards everything .  apparently , yet another version of this story is being filmed under it's original title .  i certainly hope that this newer rendition will not be hurt by the insanity of jan de bont's version and that it will retain the psychological impact that the original release had .

0|" "" tarzan and the lost city "" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while .  not only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid .  unfortunately , it's not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like "" heaven's gate "" ( 1980 ) or "" ishtar "" ( 1987 ) were bad .  instead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place .  with all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ?  of course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984's "" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes "" ) down to the really bad ( 1981's "" tarzan , the ape man "" with bo derek ) .  most of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps .  therefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others .   "" greystoke "" added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even "" tarzan , the ape man "" at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek's bare breasts .   "" tarzan and the lost city , "" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue .  the script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come .  comic books have better plots than this .  the movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer's comedy "" george of the jungle . ""  didn't the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ?  the story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage .  when the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week .  however , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa's last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle .  at first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man .  once the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city .  most of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of .  there are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from "" raiders of the lost ark "" ( 1981 ) to "" the goonies "" ( 1985 ) .  when the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river .  the movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality .  for instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn't even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do .  instead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival .  of course , one can't help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is .  not to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city .  there is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) .  which also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it's sitting right out in the middle of an open field ?  strictly speaking , "" tarzan and the lost city "" isn't even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien's laughably stiff performance comes real close .  this movie proves what "" starship troopers "" only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle .  van dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he's a calvin klein model in a loin cloth .  i also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut .  waddington makes a decent villain , although he's like a charmless version of belloq from "" raiders of the lost ark . "" as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan .  she does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess .  however , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news .   "" tarzan and the lost city "" is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid .  so , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short .
