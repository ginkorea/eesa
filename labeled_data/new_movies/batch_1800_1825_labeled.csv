0|"there were four movies that earned jamie lee curtis the title of "" scream queen "" in the early '80s .  two of them were halloween movies , but the other two -- prom night and terror train -- were the uninspired knockoffs that came directly after the success of halloween .  the same "" god , i'm scared , there's some guy in a mask coming after me "" routine she did in john carpenter's classic , jamie lee copies here , with none of the urgency or suspense .  terror train takes place on ( where else ? ) a train , charted by some pre-med students finishing their first four years of higher education .  most of them won't make it to med school , though , and it's obvious from the foreshadowing done when the conductor complains , "" i wish to hell they'd put a radio on that train . ""  the conductor character probably has the most lines of anyone , even jamie lee .  from the beginning , he's talking his head off ( he tells one of his co-workers "" think on this -- when's the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station ? ""  as if it makes any kind of sense ) and it only gets better as he engages himself in an argument about the benefits of railroad over recreational vehicles .  of course , the loudmouth conductor is the first person to find a bloody body , which is then gone when he brings a skeptical trainman back to view it .  i forgot to mention the prologue .  it's a party three years earlier , with the same group of students .  two of them play a trick on a geeky frat pledge , promising him he's going to get laid .  they send jamie lee up to stand behind the bed and talk to the geek as he comes in , noticing a form on the bed .  she says , "" kiss me , kenny , "" and he kisses the body on the bed , which happens to be a cadaver .   ( "" oh my god , they killed kenny !  you bastards ! "" )  it's a sick trick , and one jamie lee wasn't let in on .  she still hasn't forgiven the guy as they board the terror train ( "" you asshole , you can't have a good time without hurting somebody ! "" ) .  the killing starts before the train even leaves the station .  since it's new year's , everyone's wearing disguises ( a convenient plot device we've seen before ) , and someone stabs the guy in the groucho mask when no one's looking .  at least one of the characters says it's a groucho mask ; when the killer dons it and steps aboard , it looks like gene shalit who , by the way , would make a great killer in a slasher movie .  speaking of weird-looking dorks who still persist on the entertainment scene , one of terror train's most famous gimmicks is the appearance of david copperfield "" as the magician , "" who regails those aboard with illusions set to disco music .  then there's his greatest trick -- getting laid with hair that looks like that .  for all its attempts at visual style and substance , terror train is more lionel than amtrak , more prom night than halloween , and nothing really worth watching .  only die-hard fans of jamie lee curtis and david copperfield ( if he truly has any fans ) should even attempt to watch it .  and it makes me wonder if a horror movie set in an rv could be much worse .  i mean , when was the last time someone built a shopping mall next to a train station , anyway ?  terror train is definitely the cinematic equivalent of a sleeper car .

0|according to hitchcock and various other filmmakers , isolated motels , diners , gas stations and similar establishments in american southwest can be rather dangerous place for weary travellers .  at the beginning of eye of the storm , 1991 german- american thriller directed by yuri zeltser , one of such places becomes deadly for their owners who get murdered during the stick up .  ten years later their son steven ( played by bradley gregg ) , who was blinded during the incident , still runs motel together with his older brother ray ( played by craig sheffer ) .  hardly anything happens there until alcoholic and abusive william gladstone ( played by dennis hopper ) gets stranded there with his attractive wife sandra ( played by lara flynn boyle ) .  their unexpected presence creates the chain of the events that would end in bloodshed .  yuri zeltser , author of this film , was obviously inspired by hitchcock's psycho , but he chose to add some new and potentially interesting elements to the original plot .  instead of norman bates we have two brothers - one of them traumatised physically , another mentally .  sexual tension between beautiful female patron and shy motel clerk is heightened with the presence of alcoholic husband .  eye of the storm is impressive in visual sense , with photography by karl walter lindenlaub providing a lot of claustrophobic atmosphere .  the acting is fine - hopper , gregg and boyle are comfortable with their roles , but sheffer at times overacts his psycho routine .  unfortunately , eye of the storm , which was supposed to be intense psychological drama , deteriorates into cheap and predictable slasher flick during melodramatic finale .  in the end , this film reminds us that original approach can't prevent filmmakers from wasting too many opportunities .

0|"if you've been following william fichtner's career ( and there's absolutely no reason why you should have ) , you might have noticed that he's played some rather similar roles over the years .  like sully in "" the perfect storm "" --tough , gruff , and a little bit scary .  or law in "" albino alligator "" --tough , gruff , and little bit scarier .  or colonel william sharp in "" armageddon , "" or dwayne engelman in "" strange days , "" or even his brief appearance towards the beginning of "" pearl harbor , "" as the abusive father of danny--here is an actor who gravitates towards tough , gruff , hard-hitting roles .  which is why his performance in "" what's the worst that could happen ? ""  is such a shock , such a delight .  in the film , fichtner plays a blonde haired , meticulously dressed , overtly effeminate , dog-loving detective .  as alex tardio , fichtner's performance borders on caricature but goes beyond it .  it borders on offensive but doesn't really manage it .  and it borders on clich ? d stereotype but doesn't quite succumb to that definition either .  in a role so diametrically opposed to what the actor has played before we should have seen it coming , fichtner isn't perfect--you can see him struggling a little at times , concentrating a little too hard on the look as he swishes his hand through the air , or nuzzles a coiffed canine up close and personal--but he's pretty damned good , and silly , and without question the best thing in the film .  in fact , had it not been for fitchner's sudden and bizarre appearance , and his jarring screen presence thereafter , i would have walked out , for "" what's the worst that could happen ?

0|"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  it's rather easy to start tuning out after about twenty minutes of finn taylor's first feature film , dream with the fishes , when the plodding , tedious opening sequence finally pays off with a potentially provocative setup .  any hopeful expectations , however , are soon vanquished as the film settles upon being an uninvolving mismatched-buddy movie which is rarely as funny as it aspires to be nor nearly as affecting as it eventually strives to be in the film's latter half .  the film's central characters are terry ( david arquette ) , a depressed , lonely voyeur who claims to be despondent since the death of his wife in an automobile accident , and nick ( brad hunt ) , a carefree young street tough later revealed to be terminally ill .  nick lives in the apartment building across from terry , who spies on the trysts between nick and girlfriend liz ( kathryn erbe ) with his trusty set of binoculars , but the two young men first formally meet at the bay bridge where a half-drunk terry precariously teeters upon the edge , unconvincingly vowing suicide .  nick casually asks for terry's wristwatch , and eventually cons terry into a trade - the watch for a bottle of pills .  of course , terry finds that the pills do not end up having the presumed lethal effects , and he angrily sets out to find nick in order to retrieve his watch .  learning of nick's condition ( he only has a handful of weeks left ) , terry's compassion kicks in , and the two eventually come to a distinctly peculiar arrangement - terry will agree to bankroll the dying nick's lifelong fantasies , and nick will fulfill terry's death wish by killing him .  this is a promising premise , and mr . taylor's film could have gone any number of ambitious ways from this point , but he instead chooses to capitalise upon the obvious inversion of the characters ( terry is a repessed , mournful character who wants to die , while nick is a free spirit with a joie de vivre who is dying but wants to live ) and takes the easy route out by turning dream with the fishes into a typical lark where the two characters engage in a series of generally dull exploits , and where the straight-laced character learns to enjoy and ppreciate life when hooked up with a quirky character .  this is by-the-numbers plotting , buddy movie/road movie redux .  however , dream with the fishes is most hampered not by its uninspired storyline , but by the characters which carry the story - it helps in such a film to have at least one of the protagonists be at least somewhat empathetic , if not likeable .  unfortunately , that is not the case here , where both of the film's leading characters are thorougly uninteresting and annoying , giving the audience very little to sympathise with their respective plights , and even less reason to want to follow their onscreen exploits .  far from a romp , this fatal flaw makes dream with fishes more like a chore to endure than a playful jaunt , and undermines the attempts at emotional resonance in the latter stages of the film as the two men begin to bond .  mr . taylor's dialogue sporadically falls flat in dream with the fishes - while attempting to capture a quirky and clever tone , it too often comes across instead as hopelessly contrived ( witness such lines as "" you should have asked something more interesting , like 'do you enjoy the pain ? '  - see , that's provocative , leaves room for further questions . "" )  the film enjoys a few inspired moments - the urn scene , a session of nude bowling , the policeman joining in on terry and nick's acid trip - but unfortunatetely these instances are few and far between , and for the most part the humour in dream with the fishes registers more as attempts rather than actual successes .  this occurs particularly often during the film's opening sequence - as terry is wrestling the bedridden nick for his watch in the hospital , i'm realising that this is * intended * to be funny , although nary a smile crept upon my lips - which is probably due to the obvious fact that it's painfully clear to the audience from the outset that terry is going to be thwarted in his initial suicide attempts , sapping any element of surprise or amusement from nick's scheme of tricking him ; this is not a film which has the wherewithal to kill off its leading star in the opening ten minutes .  the entire sequence is , then , clearly an exercise for character exposition , with attempts at humour terribly diminished by utter predictability .  among the cast , coming off best is david arquette , the current master in the portrayal of meek , squirming , stammering fresh-faced characters - he would have been terrific as the lead for george huang's swimming with sharks - who gets to apply his adeptness for timidity as terry .  mr . taylor ambitiously employs an interesting visual technique , where the portions of the film set in an urban environment have been processed to appear extremely grainy and heavily saturated , as opposed to a bright , crisp look for the smalltown scenes .  the charge of dream with the fishes's protagonists being wholly unempathetic is a bit of an odd one coming from me ; i seem to have a predilection for films with unlikeable characters , and indeed , in many cases have i been in the minority , supporting films which have been condemned as interminable due to the difficult , audience-unfriendly nature of their characters .  for dream with the fishes , though , i did find myself on the flip side of coin , often hoping that the film would quickly conclude , and that the nick character would just hurry up and die .

0|"for his directoral debut , gary oldman chose a highly personal family drama about a violent , alcoholic husband and father , and the various lives he affects .  but while the characters , places and events may have special meaning to the writer-director , the audience is left in the dark .  the center of this tale is the abusive raymond ( ray winstone ) , and the film focuses on him and the people who orbit around him .  he spends his days hanging out with his friends at pubs and girlie bars .  then , he returns home to his pregnant wife , valerie ( kathy burke ) and their five-year-old daughter .  raymond demonstrates his violent tendencies ( and his paranoid delusions ) early on when he accuses valerie's brother , billy ( charlie creed-miles ) , of stealing .  raymond then proceed to beat ( and bite ) him to a bloody wreck .  but these are the least of billy's problems .  billy is a heroin addict on the downturn , and it doesn't seem that he'll last much longer .  billy and valerie's mother , janet ( laila morse ) , is raymond's nemesis .  she disapproves of him ( and he of her ) , but is powerless to do anything about it .  she merely struggles on , hoping her children will survive their respective torments .  if this description seems bleak , i haven't told the half of it .  this is not a cheery movie , and most of the time it's downright depressing .  while at times it is interesting to watch to see just what makes raymond tick , and why no one ever simply calls the cops on him , in the end , it's not quite worth it .  there are too many scenes which randomly dot the picture with little or no purpose .  take for example the extended sequence where one of billy's scuzzy friends defends a stray puppy .  the film is filled with these "" character moments "" that never really achieve anything .  granted , there are a few genuinely powerful ( and sickening ) moments in the film , but their expression seems to be more of a catharsis for the creator than us .  the actors do a fine job , particularly in the central roles .  the good thing about an actor turned writer is that oldman knows how to write good scenes , and the actors in nil by mouth have some meat they can tear into .  the bad thing about an actor turned director is that there's no one to restrain oldman from making poor choices .  a good character drama should mean something to those involved in making the film and the audience .  oldman got it about half right .

0|"my first exposure to the nightmare on elm street series of films was not this one , but in fact the third installment ( it was the first to gain a national theatrical release ) .  i didn't see the first film until much later .  so looking back , the original didn't hold a lot of great memories for me , since i didn't think too much of it when i initially saw it .  watching it now for a second time confirmed that it's an overrated horror film that ultimately makes no sense whatsoever .  you all know the story by now : child murderer freddy krueger ( robert englund ) returns from the grave by haunting the dreams of the children of those who burned him alive years before .  this first installment does an adequate job with it's low budget , but there's some absurd dialogue and conceptual problems with the story .  plus the movie's ending ( understandably the result of the studio wanting the end of the film to have a "" hook "" for a sequel ) renders the rest of the film pointless .  and does anyone understand what happens to nancy's mother at the end of this film ?  don't get me wrong though . . .  it's not as if a new generation of horror films have spurned me away from the classics .  most horror movies released today are just as inane as this film is .  horror is a difficult genre to pull off credibly , and a nightmare on elm street just doesn't cut it .  a nightmare on elm street is available on dvd from new line home video .  it is available both as a single disc and as part of the nightmare on elm street collection box set .  the film is presented in both pan and scan and it's original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 78 : 1 ( although on the disc that comes in the box set , only a widescreen transfer is provided ) .  the film has been digitally remastered and includes two options for audio : a mono mix and a new dolby digital 5 . 1 mix .  also included on the dvd is a full-length audio commentary track with writer/director wes craven , stars john saxon and heather langenkamp , and the film's director of photography .  other extras include the "" jump to a nightmare "" feature ( i'm sure you can figure that one out ) , the usual cast and crew bios ( which are from the film's original press release kit , and notably leave out robert englund and johnny depp ! ) , and the film's original theatrical trailer .  some dvd-rom features are also included , but since i don't have dvd-rom capabilities i can't really get into that .  the commentary track is entertaining and informative , but nothing spectacular .  the first thing of note is that it's the same commentary track that was on the special edition laserdisc from a few years ago .  i'm not saying that's a negative thing , just pointing it out .  everyone seems enthusiastic about being there , with the possible exception of john saxon , who just doesn't say much at all .  most of the time you'll forget he's even there .  everyone else talks really quietly though for some reason , as if because they're commenting on a scary movie that they need to stay as quiet as possible .  the bonus disc with the boxed set called the nightmare series encyclopedia features about 45 minutes worth of interviews relating to the first film of the series .  also included is the original theatrical trailer and two alternate endings to the film . . .  however you can only access one easily .  the other is hidden in what's called "" the labyrinth "" , which might possibly be the most annoying feature of a dvd ever created .  basically , it's an interactive game of sorts where you wander through different nightmare locations looking at objects which give you access to extra little snippets of footage , interviews , etc . somewhere in the labyrinth is the second alternate ending to the film .  finding it though is both a chore and a bore .

0|"in 1989 , tim burton took the legendary comic book figure of batman and turned him into a huge box office hit with an atmospheric little film that created an utterly distinct feeling somewhere between film noir and the godfather .  was it "" deep "" ?  nope .  however it was a perfect entertainment and the audience ate it up .  it was natural that roger ebert trashed it writing that it was "" without the comic book uplift "" of the indiana jones and superman pictures .  which was true .  if what you were looking for was the tale of a heroic man's escadapes and adventures you were looking in the wrong place .  if those films were tom sawyer , then batman was huckleberry finn .  some critics ( glenn lovell of the san jose mercury news and peter travers of rolling stone ) realized that it was something special ; mr . lovell gave it * * * 1/2 and wrote that "" this is batman as batman should be .

0|"and i thought "" stigmata "" would be the worst religiously-oriented thriller released this year .  turns out i was wrong , because while "" stigmata "" was merely boring and self-important , "" end of days "" is completely inept on all fronts .  it's a silly , incomprehensible , endlessly stupid mess .  for a guy like me who grew up watching arnold schwarzenegger at his best , it's extremely disconcerting to see where the big man has ended up .  for the first time in recent memory , an arnold action movie ( and "" batman & robin "" doesn't count ) is no fun at all .   "" end of days "" is a major stinker .  the movie opens in vatican city , 1979 .  some catholic priests have observed an ancient prophecy , which says that a girl will be born on that night that satan will have targeted for impregnation .  if he impregnates her between 11 and midnight on december 31 , 1999 , the world will be destroyed .  the pope orders protection of this girl , though some priests believe she ought to be killed .  in new york , that very night , a girl is born to fulfill the prophecy .  twenty years later , we meet jericho cane ( schwarzenegger ) , a suicidal ex-cop with a drinking problem .  now working as a security guard for hire , he is protecting a local businessman ( gabriel byrne ) , who is actually possessed by the devil .  an assassination attempt on the businessman by a crazed former priest leads him to the girl satan is after , christine york ( robin tunney ) .  recognizing elements of his own murdered daughter in christine ( including ownership of the same music box , apparently ) , jericho swears to protect her against the devil and the faction of priests looking to kill her .  there are so many problems with this film it's hard to know where to begin , but how about starting with the concept ?  casting arnold in a role like this was a mistake to begin with .  schwarzenegger is a persona , not an actor , so putting him in a role that contradicts his usual strong personality is a bad idea .  arnold has neither the dramatic range nor the speaking ability to pull off a character tormented by conflicting emotions .  in other words , trying to give him dimension was a mistake .  harrison ford , mel gibson , or even bruce willis could have played this role ( they've all played noble and flawed heroes ) , but not schwarzenegger .  there are several scenes that attempt to establish jericho's character ; one has him contemplating suicide , another crying over the loss of his wife and daughter , and even one in which the devil tries to tempt him into revealing christine's location by offering him his old life back .  none of these scenes really work , because arnie isn't up to the task .  the filmmakers would have been better off making jericho a strong , confident character ( like the terminator , for example ) , the likes of which schwarzenegger has excelled in before .  this one isn't at all believable the way arnold plays him .  the supporting cast tries their hardest , and only gabriel byrne makes any impact at all .  as the prince of darkness , he's suave and confident .  he acts like one would expect the devil to act .  the problem is that the script has him doing things that make no sense ( more on that later ) and that undermines him as a powerful villain .  byrne out-performs arnold in every scene they have together ( including the aforementioned temptation bit ) , but this is problematic when it causes the audience to start doing the unthinkable : root for the devil .  byrne's speech about the bible being "" overrated "" actually starts to make sense , mainly because arnold's attempts at refuting it ( mostly of the "" 'tis not ! ""  variety ) are feeble at best .  the only problem is , arnold has to win , so in the end , nobody really cares .  kevin pollack plays jericho's security guard sidekick and tries to liven things up with some comic asides , but like most bad action movie sidekicks , he disappears after about an hour .  robin tunney isn't given much to do except look scared .  in fact , all of the supporting players are good actors , but none , save for byrne , is given anything interesting to do .  performances aside , it would be really hard to enjoy this film no matter who starred in it .  this being an action blockbuster , it's no surprise that the worst thing about it is the script , which starts off totally confusing , and when some of it is explained ( and not much of it is ) , it's utterly ridiculous .  why is the devil coming on new year's eve , 1999 ?  because it's exactly 1000 years after the year of the devil , which isn't 666 , it turns out .  some nutty priest accidentally read it upside down , so the real year is 999 , so just add a 1 to the beginning , and you've got 1999 !  if you don't buy this explanation , you're not alone .  it's convoluted and silly at the same time .  the method by which jericho locates christine york is equally ludicrous ( she's christine , see , and she lives in new york , see .   .   . ) , and if that weren't bad enough , there's plenty of bothersome stuff in this film that isn't explained at all .  why can satan kill everyone he passes on the street , but when it comes to snuffing out one drunk ex-cop , he's powerless ?  is he impervious to only one kind of bullet ?  how come he can't control jericho or christine ?  and how did those gregorian monks deal with time zones in their prophecies ?  a clumsy attempt at a joke is made about this , but it's never actually explained .  usually , this sort of thing wouldn't matter in a schwarzenegger flick ( i mean , don't get me started on the time paradoxes offered up by the terminator movies ) , but this time the plot inconsistencies stand out even more than usual because the action is rarely exciting .  there are several predictable horror film clich ? s present in "" end of days , "" complete with the old "" black cat hiding in a cabinet "" bit , not that we ever find out what the cat was doing in there .  it gets so formulaic that it's possible for those uninterested in being scared to close their eyes at the precise moment a "" boo "" will come .  their predictions will rarely be wrong .  the more grandiose action sequences are utterly charmless , partially because we don't care about these characters ( due to the script's pathetic attempts at characterization and setup ) , and also because they , too , don't make any sense .  there's a scene where schwarzenegger gets thrown around a room by a little old lady .  it's good for a few chuckles , but not much else .  supposedly we're to believe she now has super strength by virtue of being controlled by satan , but the script never sets that up , so the scene is merely silly .  none of this is terribly exciting , because all the action sequences are so badly framed that it's often hard to tell why it's happening in the first place , not to mention that they're edited in full-on incomprehensible mtv quick-cut style .  most of them had me scratching my head , rather than saying , "" wow , cool ! ""   "" end of days "" is not only silly and confusing , but it's also distinctly unpleasant to watch .  the devil apparently doesn't operate in the more subtle , i'll-convince-people-to-kill-each-other fashion outlined in the bible , but instead enjoys killing people gruesomely in broad daylight .  this doesn't only make him an awfully predictable sort , but it also means that not a single scene in "" end of days "" goes by without unnecessarily graphic violence , or the odd kinky sexual encounter ( yet another bit that had me scratching my head ) .  if violence is supposed to be shocking , it's not a good idea to throw so much of it into a movie that the audience goes numb .  scenes aren't connected through any reasonable means , so a lot of the time , stuff gets blown up , or people get killed , and i had no idea why .  reasons ?  to hell with reasons !  let's just blow stuff up !  isn't it cool ?  nope , not by a long shot .  this film is thoroughly unwatchable .  it's dull , interminable , and unrelenting in its stupidity .  perhaps arnold needs to make some movies with james cameron to revive his career , because it's not happening with hack peter hyams here .   "" end of days "" might have had camp value , if only it didn't top itself off with an overly pious ending that nobody's going to buy .  if the movie is going to be serious , the filmmakers should have come up with a decent script .  if it's going to be campy , arnold shouldn't be taking himself so damn seriously ( i didn't actually see him put up on a cross , did i ? ) , and his character shouldn't be such a sad sack .  as it stands , "" end of days "" is just a bad movie , and an awfully gloomy one at that .

""  but these previous movies were funny because the jokes seemed more universally understood and there was more of a manic silliness at work .  as i write this , i also wonder how many people have actually seen the movies on which this spoof is based .  crime movies in general contain a lot of profanity and violence .  it's a tough genre to parody .  i was kind of hoping that they could somehow spoof the profanity used in all of those crime movies , maybe by having all of the tough crime lords say "" please "" as they decide which sector to take over , but this opportunity was never explored .  there were one or two moments that made me smile such as the scene where vincenzo is dancing with his newly wed daughter-in-law .  a gunman shoots him several times .  the impact of the bullets cause him to make these wild contortions that force the wedding band to change music styles to keep up with him , from the samba to disco to the macarena .  i think that i just gave away the best part of the film .  oh well , that just means that you can go to sleep a little earlier .

0|die hard 2 is an altogether unfortunate fiasco , inferior to the original in every respect .  place the blame squarely on the shoulders of steven de souza and doug richardson , who wrote the film's pathetic screenplay .  every line of dialogue reeks of either smarmy sap or forced humor .  the plot is altogether implausible ; the convoluted story line involves a band of terrorists who take over dulles airport and shut down the control tower , leaving a dozen planes stranded in the air waiting to land .  the film has zero credibility , and all of the characters come off as cliched , cardboard cut-outs .  so much for the script .  how about the action ?  well , let's put it this way : director renny harlin could learn a few things from john mctiernan , who directed the original , as well as the hunt for red october and predator--all standouts for their hair-raising suspense .  by contrast , harlin doesn't have a clue when it comes to choreographing action , and consequently , die hard 2 never picks up steam .  die harder is impossible to take seriously even for a minute .  in fact , the movie often seems deliberately campy , and it almost reaches the threshold of being so bad it's good .  you do laugh , but you laugh at the film , not with it .  die hard 2 should have never been cleared for takeoff .  |-0.9333333333333332|0.8833333333333333|0.9|"The explanations unanimously criticize ""Die Hard 2"" for its various flaws, including a weak screenplay, forced dialogue, implausible plot, lack of credibility, cliched characters, and poor action choreography.

0|"i admit it .  i thought arnold schwarzenegger had a knack for comedy when he made twins and true lies .  watching him in jingle all the way , i wondered why anyone ever thought he could carry such a lame movie targeted at susceptible kids .  it was one thing to scare the crap out of kids with the pg-13 kindergarten cop , but parents who let small children see this movie will have to explain themes of violence , alcohol consumption , burglary , racism and child molestation .  and you know they'll burst out in tears when arnold punches one of santa's elves .  he later decks a reindeer .  hey , man , why don't you just kick the easter bunny in the nuts while you're at it ?  jingle all the way is formula crap that follows the if someone falls on his ass , it must be funny school of thought .  arnold , sinbad and phil hartman crash to the ground more times in this movie than a special olympics hockey team , and the movie dredges up more cliche and less believability with each successive scene .  what can you expect from a movie whose entire premise is that two parents can't find a rare toy on christmas eve , and will do anything to get one ?  arnold is , of course , one of the parents , a crack salesman who is never there for his son .  he races from the office to his son's karate game , only to find out he missed it .  and his kid distrusts him because he's never around .   ( gee , we haven't seen that in a movie before . )  arnold the absentee father becomes convinced that the only way to buy back his son's affection is to get him a turboman doll , which his wife ( rita wilson , who will never be the breadwinner of the hanks household choosing roles like this ) told him to get weeks ago .  so arnold sets out to find a turboman , which turns out to be more rare than the tickle me elmo was when jingle all the way came out .  let me back up for a minute here -- arnold's kid is totally obsessed with this turboman character , which is unhealthy beyond belief .  watches the show , eats the cereal , sleeps on the freakin' turboman sheets .  i'd try to discourage any further obsession myself , lest any kid seeing this movie think it's a wonderful thing to con your dad into racing out to buy you any toy you want .  but nooooo , the climax of jingle all the way has arnold dressed up as turboman in a parade , exonerating himself of all wrongdoing in the eyes of wife and son , who don't recognize him until the last minute .  this is a sad movie all the way through , but it only gets worse after the opening scenes of arnold and mailman sinbad stampeding through a store , racing off to the mall and hooking up with a santa ( jim belushi ) who runs a bootleg toy factory .  most painful to watch is a scene at a radio station , where sinbad holds off the cops with a letter bomb after beating up the deejay ( an embarrassed martin mull ) who said he was giving away a turboman doll .  capitalism has produced some pretty evil things ( chia pets ) , but this ode to excess and violent consumerism is one of the most shameful .  never mind the subplot with perfect neighbor phil hartman trying to seduce wilson while arnold is off shopping ( "" your cookies are incredible "" ) , it's the main plot of the movie that sends the message that it's okay to do whatever it takes to get your hands on what you want .  maybe that's what christmas is like at the schwarzenegger house , but not at mine .

0|"when the haunting arrived in theaters , all i kept hearing about was the overdone special effects and the fact that very often the unseen bumps in the night in a horror film are far scarier than those that you can put a face to courtesy of special effects .  while i agree that this remake of the haunting goes a bit overboard in the visual effects department , i don't think that they are completely to blame for this movie's failure .  it appears that some people have failed to take into account that the original haunting had the "" unseen "" terrors , and it was about as scary as a dust bunny .  so special effects or not , if the story isn't the least bit scary , you aren't going to end up with a very frightening movie .  the thing that interested me most about this movie was the caretaker of this building played by bruce dern .  dern is always great , and even though he may have had only about 3 minutes of screen time he was still the most interesting element of the movie .  as i sat through the seemingly endless , albeit fairly impressive , special effects , i kept wishing that this movie was about dern's caretaker and not the one dimensional characters that populated the cast .  never a good sign when a bit player is the best part of the movie .  liam neeson plays a scientist who is conducting experiments on fear .  he decides the best way to get results is to trick a group of fairly unstable individuals to spend a few days in a haunted mansion .  he tricks them into participating by letting on that he is conducting an experiment on insomnia .  and he also fails to mention that the mansion has a reputation for strange goings-on .  catherine zeta-jones , lili taylor and owen wilson play his subjects .  like the original , taylor's character is the star of the movie .  but since she doesn't quite have the marquee power of liam neeson and ms . zeta-jones , their parts did seem to be a big larger than in the original .  and let's face it , probably half the people who see this movie will do so because of zeta-jones .  i'll admit that i would have never seen this thing if she weren't in it .  but the real stars here is the special effects combined with the fairly overdone sets .  they take over the movie as the supernatural elements of the house start to interact with our hapless insomnia patients .  there really isn't much of a story here .  just endless setups so director jan de bont can showcase all the nifty special effects that he got to play with .  and the special effects are great .  in many cases they are as good as you are likely to see anywhere .  in other cases they are overdone and obviously thrown in just for the sake of hitting the "" cool shots "" quota .  at no point in the movie do any of these things ever come close to being scary -- funny , maybe .  but not scary .  then we have the set .  when i first saw the house , i was very impressed with the very cool gothic look about it .  but it only took a short tour by the characters around the place to see that the set designers obviously had as much money to burn as the visual effects people did , and decided to take the idiotically overdone route .  this included a flooded hallway with books as stepping stones and a mirrored circular room that revolves .  what part did these rooms play in the story ?  absolutely none .  they were just there to take our minds off the fact that there was neither a descent story nor a single scare in the entire movie .  then we have the actors .  lili taylor has never been one of my favorites .  and when the fact that her character is mousy and pathetic is factored in , she comes in around the average or slightly below mark .  i have no idea why liam neeson took this role .  he basically reminded me of the ringmaster at an out of control circus .  his character was in charge of this farce but it quickly got away from him .  i have no doubt that liam will want to lock all prints of this movie in a very secure vault along with all copies of darkman .  zeta-jones was cast because she is too hot for words .  the fact that her character is bi-sexual is just icing on the cake .  all catherine has to do in this movie is look good .  fortunately that is something she does very well .  while she does have a fairly good size part , it is obvious that her only purpose in the movie was as eye-candy .  it's too bad someone of her talents wasted them here .  any random supermodel pulled out of a fashion show could have easily filled her role .  the haunting is the antithesis of another of 1999's horror movies , the blair witch project .  the haunting had a seemingly limitless effects budget , while blair witch relies on piles of rocks for its scares .  both prove quite nicely that special effects are irrelevant to a horror film .  if the story sucks , it's all downhill from there .  my advice ?  if you are looking for special effects , go rent star wars .  if it's scares you want , rent halloween .  either way , it's probably in your best interests to skip the haunting .

0|"i am a steven seagal fan .  i only say this now because "" mufti splenetik "" isn't my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things .  any proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on .  seagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we'll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it's a real-life model-wife who hasn't worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine .  not to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he's been in since nico doing his "" my hands are sharp , nimble knives "" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull .  in the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest .  he's also put on quite a lot of weight .  small potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain't broke , why fix it ?   ( more on this disappointed person's dashed expectations later ) .  as jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past .  while he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole .  it turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can't trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that "" glimmer man "" thing .  an increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole's former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons .  the glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) .  it's the other changes that disappoint .  for example , although there's a fair amount of violence in this movie , there's also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television's "" in living colour . ""  wayans plays whiney straightman to seagal's bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his "" are you crazy "" part of the dialogue with wasted zest .  as campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner's eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal's wooden comebacks make for painful watching .  a cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble .  he chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies .  again , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual .  heck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film .  is that a lot to ask of the seague ?  too much .  seagal's best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone .  not for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think .  no kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows .  that's really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else .  we trusted him .  we got to know him .  now , betrayal .  i don't know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he's going to try to be funny again .  i'll try , but it won't be easy .  if you haven't watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out .  it's easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences .  after all , if we can't depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ?  the flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .  mufti spelenetik is still a steven seagal fan .  everybody makes mistakes once in awhile .

""  it isn't funny the first time .  it isn't funny the eighth time .  it isn't funny the eighteenth time .  if anything , it made me feel vaguely self-conscious .  garry meets up with a coworker at a bank played by greg kinnear , who turns out to be a generic , unlikable scumbag .  he's meant to fill the part of unfortunate role model for shandling's alien character , but he's so flatly drawn that even the writers quickly give up and toss him aside .  kinnear's scumbagginess is demonstrated by the fact that he claims other peoples' work as his own to worm his way into a vice presidents' position and goes to aa meetings to pick up chicks .  wow .  what a magnificent bastard .  nearly every man in the movie , in fact , is played as the same sort of sex-driven slimeball .  when kinnear's wife walks into the office , there isn't a single guy who doesn't trip , bump into a wall , or otherwise pratfall as if they'd never seen a woman before .  the few guys that aren't particularly slimeballs , such as john goodman's detective character , are simply uncommunicative workaholics .  shandling meets up with annette bening , who will inevitably prove to be the love he never knew existed , at one of kinnear's aa meetings .  shandling's mission is to have a baby , and when he reveals his desires to her , bening instantly falls for him , and the next day . . .  they get married .  yup .  the next day .  cuz ya see , it turns out she wants a baby too !  bening's character perhaps was the most difficult to watch , especially after seeing her come apart at the seams so effectively in american beauty . . .  if her character here is supposed to be representing the female of the species as a whole , then woe , i say , to the species .  she's unfathomably insecure , and succumbs so easily to all of shandling's lines and lies that it borders on tragic .  there's a point where , after thinking she may not be able to bear children , she learns that she is indeed pregnant .  when garry comes home after nearly cheating on her , she strolls into the kitchen and sings "" high hopes "" ( you know , the uplifting ant and the rubber tree plant song ) to deliver the news , and then says to him , "" now you can't leave me . ""  we're supposed to empathize with shandling's discovery of the feeling of "" guilt , "" but instead i wanted to weep for bening that she was placing her entire life and soul firmly in the lap of a great big nothing .  and eventually , shandling falls in love with her . . .  for real , i suppose , though i'm not sure exactly what prompted it .  what's the message i derive from all this ?  men are liars , inherently empty creatures , but if you hang around long enough . . .  well , maybe something will click .  ha ha . . .  ha ?  i'm thankful such broad cynicism isn't frequently allowed to run so rampant .  let's all join hands and pray that the planet these folks are from is not this one .  there's also a subplot involving john goodman as an airline incident investigator that wades in the bog of stupidity .  goodman , through a series of astoundingly implausible realizations , puts together the fact that shandling is a being from another world with a magic , vibrating penis .  it has all the makings for a subplot of having shandling be discovered , that , thankfully , never comes to the inevitable hackneyed fruition .  instead , it just dangles limply on the branch for a while , withers , and falls away .  further proof that goodman should just stick to doing coen brothers movies .  but let's not dwell on this any longer , i've already wasted plenty of your time and my own .  let's move on , forget about what we've seen here , and get on with our lives .  and to help us out , let's end things on a happy note . . .  congratuations go out to annette bening , winner of this week's "" title !

0|`the skulls' is a laughably bad thriller , a teen-orientated doppelganger of `the firm' so blazingly ridiculous that it caused me to drift into a hypnotic stupor .  certain moments are so preposterous that i nearly herniated myself in an attempt to stifle laughter .  i chuckled incessantly , all the way home .  let me share .  the skulls is a secret society conceived inside the walls of yale ( designed , i'm sure , to mirror the actual skull & bones from the same college ) .  luke mcnamara ( joshua jackson ) , a townie and local varsity rowing championship victor for the third consecutive year , highlights the latest skull scouting report .  despite some anxiety and caution from others , luke accepts entry into the organization .  soon after , he finds himself surrounded by beautiful women , driving a new car and marveling at the $20 , 000 that somehow surfaced in his bank account .  yeah , dude , pretty good deal eh ?  but luke soon learns that the membership is somewhat suffocating ; when circumstances become extreme , there is no way he can leave the society - except maybe as a drooling vegetable .  the premise , although lacking in originality , certainly offers its share of potential intrigue and suspense .  unfortunately , `the skulls' is neither intriguing , nor suspenseful , nor anything else you would associate with fresh or exciting .  it's just another abysmal teen prototype that has the soundtrack , the stars . . . .  but not the script .  `the skulls' is so bad it attains a certain level of entertainment value , with the screenplay , by jon pogue , immediately becoming the basis for a slew of unintentional howlers .  first off , upon their initiation into the skulls , each new member has to have a skull branded onto their arm .  afterward they are supplied with a wristwatch that conveniently covers up the scar .  will they never take this watch off ?  and what if they forget it by their bedside ?  perhaps their ? secret' society was being a little too conspicuous when they decided to brand new members like cattle on an area of the body that is easily exposed .  on top of this , they are each given a rulebook and a key to headquarters .  gee , why not member t-shirts ?  but my favorite bit is this : the voting committee for the skulls does not bother with individual ? agree' or ? disagree' notions when making collective decisions .  they are given official skull paddles .  when flipped to one side , they indicate the member agrees with the proposal .  facing the opposite way means a disagreement .  wouldn't they merely express themselves verbally ?  hell no .  they have to retrieve the paddles for a proper vote , and maybe afterward they can play ping-pong .  i'm still chuckling about these ludicrous details , but the humiliating dialogue is enough to send one into arrest .  the cast , meanwhile , combines a pinch of veteran talent with a dash of the `dawson's creek' crowd , and fuses the two together , ensuring that the embarrassment will be a mutually shared union throughout .  but not entirely .  accomplished actors like craig t . nelson ( as skulls chairman judge litten mandrake ) and william peterson ( as fellow board member senator levritt ) are dealt pathetic villain caricatures , and look suitably embarrassed handling them .  and then there's christopher mcdonald , who has the capacity to be a fun , exciting actor .  mcdonald's charisma is totally diminished here as he sleepwalks through another perfunctory bad guy role ( yes , pogue makes it a hat-trick ) .  i pray it was a `snatch-the-paycheck-and-run' exercise for all these actors .  the young troupe of performers involved fair moderately better .  let's cut the talented canadian lad joshua jackson some slack for maintaining believability within the confines of his character .  paul walker , the strapping quarterback from `varsity blues' , is bland but passable as caleb mandrake - the judge's son .  walker preserves a straight face , even when dealt the silliest dialogue in the movie ( `dad , i just killed a guy in the ritual room ! ' ) .  some actual spark is generated by leslie bibb , who plays luke's longtime chum chloe , and manages to successfully pull off some convincing dramatics .  it really boils down to the actors attempting to puncture the surrounding plastic bubble of absurdity that cages them from minute one .  or maybe not minute one , thanks to a decent set-up from director rob cohen , who films early sequences with a sense of atmosphere and style .  it makes you wonder why he didn't flee indefinitely from the project , because while enjoyable cheese like `dragonheart' and the moderate stallone thriller `daylight' aren't superior cinema , they belong on the afi top 100 list when compared to this degrading trash .  aside from unintentionally humoring the audience , `the skulls' gets little accomplished .  the thrills and action are lazy and mechanical .  the story is stuffed with ridiculous , formulaic plotting that sheepishly overlooks the cool potential of a secret underground society flick .  instead of gaining knowledge about the skulls as an organization , we are thrust into a lame video surveillance conspiracy that has developed barnacles from excessive usage .  we've seen it all before , and better .  `the skulls' is a feeble little circus of stupidity , so miscalculated that -- while it would serve as a clever pun -- a term like ? boneheaded' seems just too generous .  |-0.8333333333333334|0.9|0.9|"The overall sentiment expressed in the explanations is highly negative, as the reviewer uses words like ""laughably bad,"" ""ridiculous,"" and ""abysmal"" to describe the movie.

0|"it's difficult to expect much from a director whose greatest accomplishments to date are a handful of "" award-winning "" tv commercials , as is the case with bubble boy director blair hayes .  that said , hayes's feature film debut lives up to expectations , coming off mainly as equal parts offensive and moronic .  but occasionally , bubble boy transcends its substandard roots with glimmers of humor and scathing social commentary .  those moments of intelligence are delivered mostly by the film's two stars , jake gyllenhall as the immuno-deficient jimmy and swoosie kurtz as his over-protective , hyper religious , reagan-loving mother .  gyllenhall's sweet-natured delivery of jimmy's hilariously na ? ve narration serves as the backbone for an otherwise flimsy coming-of-age story : jimmy is a bubble boy , a kid born without immunity who could die if he comes in contact with a single germ -- a plight explored more seriously in the john travolta tv movie boy in the plastic bubble and less so on seinfeld .  his mom home-schools jimmy , filling his head with wildly twisted conservative propaganda and anti-sexual messages , until he's befriended by chloe ( marley shelton ) , the beautiful girl next door .  jimmy falls in love with chloe , but is afraid that his love will literally kill him , as evidenced in a scene when she drunkenly tries to enter his bubble for a kiss .  but when chloe decides to marry her high school boyfriend , jimmy builds a bubble suit and embarks on a hijinks-addled cross-country voyage to stop the wedding by professing his love .  the offensive bits have little to do with jimmy's rare handicap ( regardless of what the film's protesters would have you believe ) , but instead center on outrageous racial stereotypes , including a screaming chinese strip club owner and a devout east indian hindi .  but even if you find stereotype humor funny , it's hard to muster more than a giggle for these shallow gags .  they even manage to bungle some potentially great moments with a group of carnival freaks .  but a few of the harsh jabs manage to work , especially in the case of kurtz , who very bluntly shows the dark , hypocritical side of the religious right , and a wacky send-up of a cult called "" bright 'n shiny , "" led by the inimitable fabio .  unfortunately , a few giggles can't make bubble boy the riotous , off-the-wall comedy it so desperately wants to be .  honestly , it's a mystery how on earth this movie was ever made , and i'm not just saying that because it's so mediocre .  how odd for disney to take a gamble on a film with an unknown director starring virtually unknown actors that doesn't seem to appeal to any particular demographic and has the potential to offend so many .  and now that the studio is suffering through a very public protest against the film by the parents of real-life bubble boy david philip vetter , maybe disney's wondering the same thing .  hope the opening box office take makes it worthwhile .
