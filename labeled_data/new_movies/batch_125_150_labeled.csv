1|"mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er .  her mast famous episode , "" love's labour lost "" , dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child .  the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing .  there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood's big blockbuster movies .  so it's only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster .  and i have to say , after a shaky beginning , she does not disappoint .  peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists , which is obviously nothing new .  the first half hour goes into detail , way too much detail , about how the weapons are stolen .  despite a few good images , including a train collision and a very impressive explosion , none of this was very coherent .  it's long and drawn out , and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better .  once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture , it begins to take off .  george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world .  he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters .  nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling .  there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two , but that is dispensed with quickly .  the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe , trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them . clooney  goes through bouts of sarcasm , frustration , determination , and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt .  this is when leder starts to show her true stuff .  she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer .  then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter .  then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york city's crowded streets , and a madman with a nuke walking among them .  mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense .  she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking .  nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero .  you're not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her .  george clooney is a real movie star .  many of you may have hated him as batman , but this guy is for real .  he has a natural screen presence , and an ingratiating personality .  he'll be around for a while .  dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker .

1|"i have to say it .  tim burton's retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys .  ok , that's off my chest .  no more monkey puns , i promise .  seriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip-roarin' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business .  i know , i know , i promised .  and for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie .  mark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future .  he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery .  despite being darker than the original , burton's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious .  some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed .  then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter .  the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : "" one thing you don't want in your house is a human teen-ager , "" he says .  you don't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement .  touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton's brand .  lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are : "" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human . ""  anyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue .  another of burton's in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth's gen . thade .  the young chimp goes to visit his dying father .  both have one thing in common , a hatred of humans .  with his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : "" damn them , damn them all to hell , "" he says before expiring .  that is the famous line heston's taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet's terrible secret .  the performances throughout are top-notch .  wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home .  he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet .  this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable .  roth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity .  he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet .  it is a masterful turn .  helena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals .  hers is a smart , compassionate characterization .  michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken .  a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures .  as the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , "" can't we all just get along , "" echoing the words of rodney king .  much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton's technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup .  burton's musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow .  the movie's only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original .  he comes close , but falls short .  otherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs .  this is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype .

1|"urban legend surprised me .  based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena .  thankfully , legend rose above it's soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year .  you're all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who's identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody's favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the  only person you didn't suspect !  however , just because legend doesn't really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can't qualify as first-class entertainment .  it was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i've had at the movies all year .  the thing is , i'm not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive .  maybe it was the above-par performances by the movie's two leads ( jared leto and "" cybil "" actress alicia witt ) .  or , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks .  more likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise .  i don't think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman .  urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film .  a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill .  one problem , though .  would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ?  i thought not .  predictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company .  it's odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody's on the other line .  naturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off .  and the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! !  a decapitation .  it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car .  so who is it this time ?  the obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends .  a-ha .  or could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ?  like all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit .  and it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn't suspect .  i'm not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due .  and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun .   * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca  "|0.38033333333333336|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive, with the reviewer expressing surprise and positive feelings towards the film ""Urban Legend"".

1|capsule : the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi-day festivities .  mira nair's film is pleasant enough with a little human drama , a few family secrets , some sadness and some happiness .  you have seen it all before , but perhaps not from india .  the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable .   , low +2 ( -4 to +4 )  mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala .  her newest film , written by sabrina dhawan , is very similar to previous films like betsy's wedding but it is set in new delhi .  a wealthy family is having a wedding .  an indian wedding is a multi-day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial .  even more than in the us , it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get-together .  the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members' individual story lines .  aditi verma is marrying hemant , an indian engineer working in the us .  she had previously had a relationship with vikram , her supervisor .  latit , her father ( played by naseeruddin shah ) , is juggling many problems , not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey .  dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration .  even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice , one of the family servants .  several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex , family secrets , or both .  there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love .  some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films .  western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna .  on the other hand it was not clear ( to me at least ) if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films .  this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english .  the latter will , however , help with an international release .  sabrina dhawan's screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog .  we have seen films with plotting very much like this , but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference .  director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life .  i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .  |0.6666666666666666|0.8000000000000002|0.8000000000000002|The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive, with praise for the film's pleasantness, colorful photography, agreeable music, vibrant screenplay, appreciation of Indian customs, and affirmation of life.

1|"the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man's life , especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances .  thematically in cinema , love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare , however , for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni's neo-classic drama , life is beautiful .  through a central cast of father , mother , and son , benigni demonstrates the wonderful , undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times .  life * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni , directing himself here for the sixth time in his career ) , an italian jew , master con man , and aspiring waiter extraordinaire .  living in 1930's italy , he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi ) .  although dora is already engaged , guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead ; the two have a child named joshua ( giorgio cantarini ) .  unfortunately for the happy family , the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps .  it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie's theme of family love becomes the strongest .  although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm , he relaxes the role to ensure his son's happiness .  now , instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora , he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right .  benigni's performance is truly a well-rounded one , and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year .  the supports are all strong as well , but the movie truly excels in its script .  life is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable , one which tells its story in grand , two-part fashion .  in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a "" saturday night live "" spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie's second half the script's circular nature becomes admirably obvious .  characters make reprise appearances in fine form , and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot's outcome .  in all , fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture , and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first "" artsy "" film .  life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone , and above all is a fine thematic picture .

1|"while watching wes anderson's rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film's anti-hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind .  the young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman .  schwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like "" serpico "" and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result .  on the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore's baseball field ) in her honour .  unfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max's plans to woo her .  max is one of the best-written characters we've yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age .  as everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from "" the wonder years "" , from a visual standpoint , at least ) .  hopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career .  bill murray is his equal as blume , displaying a depth we haven't yet seen from him .  while this isn't his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day ) he is still terrific here .  williams isn't given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray , but still does fine work .  rushmore seems to go just a little too long but , while it isn't a perfect film , it is a definate must-see for anyone who wants to see that rarity , an american coming-of-age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality .  anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should , with any luck , rise to even greater success .

1|"no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , "" jude the obscure , "" his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life .  but , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is .   "" jude "" is a satirical film from start to finish about society's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what's remarkable is how timeless this film is .  the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn't really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it'd be kinda different ( a given ) .  it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from "" shallow grave "" ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams .  in its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world .  after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life .  taking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself .  but when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker .  another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher .  she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) .  several twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile .  because they aren't married , and because they're cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on .  if you didn't think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . .  the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world .  he will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life .  part of it is his fault - he's too optimistic , and too gullible .  but society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death .  the ending of "" jude "" is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i'll have to read it now ) .   "" jude "" offers a satirical view on society's cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn't .  there's no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem .  satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people's minds , and that's what "" jude "" is .  sure , it's one hell of a downer , but it needs to be .  the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it .  christopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times .  kate winslet , in a pre- "" titanic "" performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who's troubled but very seductive with her personality .  kate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don't believe me , see "" titanic , "" branagh's "" hamlet , "" "" sense and sensibility , "" and "" heavenly creatures , "" the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) .  in the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude's wife , whom he never divorces .   "" jude "" moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts .  but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate "" jude , "" though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it .

1|"it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters .  his new film , the thin red line , is a strange , beautiful , enigmatic mess of a movie .  the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast .  it is filled with above-the-title stars .  the cast , for the most part , gives great performances .  john travolta , whose role is nothing more than a cameo , seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve .  george clooney , whose role became a cameo in editing , gives a strange performance .  one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character's narration .  the rest of the cast , especially nick nolte and elias koteas , are unambiguously fantastic .  these actors ( and they are , with two exceptions , men ) were lured by the name of malick .  terrence malick is a cinematic legend .  he has often been called "" the j . d . salinger of cinema . ""  his two previous films , badlands and days of heaven , are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures .  after he made them , he disappeared for 20 years .  this film marks his return .  what he's made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment .  the narration which fills the film ( and perplexes many ) not only lets us hear the narrators ( the characters themselves ) pontificate , but also lets us hear such of-the-moment thoughts as "" i'm scared . ""  the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted .  the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill .  a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult , because the story is fractured .  many stories are here , from the clash between the lieutenant ( elias koteas ) and the savage colonel ( a voracious nick nolte ) to the private ( ben chaplin ) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going .  the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault .  it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box , shook the box , and poured the results onto a table .  this basically creates a mess , but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed .  i'm not declaring that the film has no structure .  while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot , malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat .  the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking .  the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice .  this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way , that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video .  ultimately , malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them .  the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature .  while some have said that the anti-war message and pro-nature tubthumping was juvenile , it was done with so much complexity and thought , that it cannot ever honestly be called childish .  after seeing the thin red line , i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again .

1|" "" stuart little "" is one of the best family films to come out this year .  it's a cute , funny and very good-natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords .  though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about , i do know that this film does not disappoint .  finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be , with a few surprising twists , some very funny moments , and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie .  stuart little is a mouse .  he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption , he now lives with the littles .  a nice little ( no pun intended ) family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city .  they have a little boy george ( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki ) and now they have a new son .  at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat .  george doesn't take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first , but once the two play together they instantly bond .  stuart however is missing something , and he wants to know who his real parents are .  the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back .  hesitating the littles know what's best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat , he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart's past ending up to a sentimental and very heart-warming ending .  one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects .  just like in "" star wars : episode 1--the phantom menace "" stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real .  from the detail of their fur , to the detail of the way the walk ; the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows .  another movie that this has in common with is "" babe "" with it's talking animals and people understanding them .  it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids .  michael j . fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the "" homeward bound "" movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could .  he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable .  another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball .  when he was timon in 1994's "" the lion king "" i would have sworn he was a comedian , and now in "" stuart little "" he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike .  for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well .  she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr . little .  both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996's "" jerry maguire "" .  even though stuart little is completely cgi , the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other .   "" stuart little "" is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter .  we get entertainment , laughs , cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie .  its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see .  even though it has a $90 million dollar budget i'm sure it will make over that or just below it respectively .  for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie , i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know "" stuart little "" and "" toy story 2 "" are by far the best family films this year .  a winner . ?

1|as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic .  but also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride .  once again , chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie , with no last name .  this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television .  of course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring .  other plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant .  the sole purpose of mr . nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint .  director samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan's , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue .  other impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw .  none of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively .  but the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ) .  filmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker .  hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before .  |-0.45|0.8333333333333334|0.85|The overall sentiment from the explanations is negative due to criticism of the film's plot and narrative logic, although there is mention of enjoyable action sequences.
1|"the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it's adequately explained by the commercials .  with 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal .  deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a "" pageant "" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero .  and if there wasn't anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington .   ( a heist comedy ?  yup .  deniro and hoffman are "" stealing "" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . )  wag the dog succeeds because it's based one great truth : the american people are stupid .  ok , maybe it's not "" love thy neighbor as thyself "" or even "" two plus two makes four "" , but a truth nonetheless .   ( any average person who thinks that they're really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . )  and because we're so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won't notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro's character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won't be able to locate albania on the map .  the beauty of wag the dog is that it isn't a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness .  nor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) .  instead , david mamet's script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire .  it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion .  deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages .  it's all : "" what do i love ?  what is it that brings me joy ?  baseball , "" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat .  he threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he's doing it in a very nice , polite way .  it's a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script .  hoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous .  this kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he's so excited that he can't even shut up .  even on the edge of disaster , he's bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive .  insiders note that he's basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have .  the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast .  the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don't .  anne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside .  denis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the "" fad king "" , who handles the profitable "" back-end "" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money .  they could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i'd go see it .  willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious "" ballad of the green berets "" parody .  woody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated "" hero "" of the albanian conflict .  craig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift .   ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . )  wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on .  we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens .  wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don't .

1|as the film opens up , expectant unwed mother sally ( played by drew barrymore ) encounters her baby's father in a fast food drive-through window .  after he gets his milkshake , he drives off , only to be pursued by a military helicopter .  from this moment forward , you know that this isn't going to be your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy .  home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian ( played by luke wilson ) , a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally . . . more  than he would care to admit ( hint : it has something to do with the father of sally's unborn child ) .  after taking a personal ( and professional ) interest in her , he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works , and the fun goes on from there .  this movie is a lot of fun .  it is comedic on two levels , as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy .  the romantic moments are sweet , yet not sappy .  one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes .  however , the dark comedic moments are more memorable .  this is also a tale of revenge , and a funny one at that .  the father of sally's unborn child also happened to be a married man , whose wife is played by catherine o'hara .  she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair , and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work .   ( my apologies if this sounds cryptic , but there is too much of the plot to give away ) .  rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus , dorian's overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy , dorian's trainer at the fast food restaurant .  the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones , even with the romantic nature of the plot .  if there are any complaints , it is over drew barrymore's performance .  while she does light up the screen , there are moments when she doesn't seem all that convincing .  the movie was filmed in texas , and most of the characters have southern texan accents .  drew barrymore's accent tends to come and go ( luke wilson doesn't seem to have this problem ) .  as well , she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant .  still , this movie is one that will please many viewers .  with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments , this is sure to entertain .  |0.65|0.8666666666666667|0.9|"The movie ""Home Fries"" is a fun and entertaining film with both comedic and dark moments, praised for its sharp dialogue and memorable dark comedic moments.

1|"the second jackal-based film to come out in 1997 ( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal ) , this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland , and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo's own alma matter , concordia university in montreal , canada .  the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal , but does not pretend to be 100% factual .  plot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal , in order to put an end to the actual militant's radical activities .  he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee .  ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this "" assignment "" , and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism , intrigue and double-personality syndrome ( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states . )  critique : great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two-hour runtime .  admittedly , i wasn't a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film , and didn't expect much from this movie beforehand , but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments , as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line .  the first hour is mostly just a build-up of things to come , and does offer a great characterization of the jackal , but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending .  quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal , but didn't offer anything extraordinary , in my opinion .  sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they've played in both of their respective careers of late , but nonetheless , appeared to relish the cold-heartedness of their chosen characters .  i didn't like performance put forth from quinn's wife in this flick , but then again , she doesn't show up in most of the film , so that wasn't so bad .  i did however enjoy director duguay's interesting style and cinematic vision .  this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences , but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer .  i thought that was neat .  having said that , i didn't think the first hour needed to be as long as it was , and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the "" fake "" jackal met with the "" real "" jackal's girlfriend without much retrospection on her part , but all in all , not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre .  little known facts : ben kingsley's real name is krishna banji , he stands 5 "" 8 , was born in scarborough , england , and won the best actor honor in 1982's academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi .  many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal , canada ( joblo's haven of restfulness ) .  donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland , is canadian , and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal .

1|one of the last entries in the long-running carry on series , carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a 'caravan' site .  professors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains .  anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance , when anna is asking for 'scrubbers for dirty caravan' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan !  arthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them .  mother-in-law jokes prevail .  furthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families .  fred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday .  however , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) .  the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp , the search for the minah bid and greyhound , the major , fred and ernie's desperate need of a woman , a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park's pub , and a shock in store for daphne .  the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing .  this is what binds the movie together .  joan sims stands out as the demanding mother-in-law , bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife , and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast .  on the other hand , there are low-key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman , and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen !  even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman , there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors .  although the regular cast is depleted , the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film .  a relative flop at the cinema , this movie deserves a lot more recognition .  |0.4333333333333333|0.7666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|The text highlights effective and amusing performances, particularly the partnership between Elke Sommer and Kenneth Williams, along with comical moments and bright performances that lift the film.

1|"the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : "" it mu5t be found . ""  so what , exactly , is the fifth element ?  after seeing luc besson's ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think .  but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen .  the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film .  speaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it .  figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson's the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) .  all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest .  what remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain .  the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last .  the frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film .  but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren't equally as interesting , and are they ever .  in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna's pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour .  gaulthier's outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson's futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film .  while besson's bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience .  for all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre .  i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed .  at first this character's hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly .  not irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno .  the tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra's innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring .  then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot .  the story's weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element .  while still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be .  the big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward .  as such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters .  this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the "" enemy "" --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made .  still , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker's original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory .  it is a fascinating example of how of one artist's fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams .

1|" "" very bad things , "" is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn't help but be won over by the material .  the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas .  the groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) .  the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern ) .  after a wild night of gambling , boozing , and drugs , a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room , but after a freak accident , to everyone's terror , she is killed .  as robert puts it : "" there are two options : go to the police and go to prison , or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her . ""  after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body , robert is forced to kill him as well .   "" okay , there is only one option now .  you can forget about calling the police , "" he says .  by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer , most of them are overcome with guilt , which sets off an even more elaborate series of event , that includes much , much more murder , double-crosses , and the inevitable wedding from hell .   "" very bad things , "" which is actor peter berg's feature film directing debut , is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that , "" there's something about mary , "" wanted to be .  it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh , original , and hilarious , even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence , gore , and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end .  the screenplay , also written by berg , is , to put it mildly , very funny and courageous .  during the second act of the film , some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death , which was beginning to undermine the humor , but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed .  the dialogue is edgy and inventive , and this film proves that a movie doesn't necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable .  there's more fun , i think , in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts .  cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here , and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura , who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends .  diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january .  by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger , and reciting lines like , "" stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs , "" i couldn't help but crack up at how "" balls-to-the-wall "" this film had become .  jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original , as daniel stern's wife , who late in the picture , we discover , is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with .  it is at this level that , "" very bad things , "" was so entertaining and surprising .  just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen , there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky .  the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top .  although i enjoyed the film immensely , let me make this clear : "" very bad things , "" is not a movie for everyone .  it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen , it is more violent and bloody than a r-rated film usually is , and it is offensive .  luckily , these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy , since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred , politically incorrect comedy .  the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and "" safe "" wide-releases coming out lately , still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry .

""  such is the result of an insulated upbringing .  though skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else .  he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it .  befriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived .  thus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut's wife ) a willing tutor .  tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life's questions . . .  many of which he was unaware needed to be asked .  he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing .  michael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world .  calling them "" princes of maine , kings of new england "" in his ritualistic goodnight , mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine .  delroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins .  director lasse hallstrom ( what's eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter .  regardless of one's personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers .  the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers .  figuring the rules didn't apply to them since they didn't have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along .  dr . larch , in his own way , acts similarly .  there is a danger in that line of reasoning .  god has also given us a set of rules .  unlike the list posted in the cider house , god's rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination .  and yet , many continue to ignore his "" rules "" preferring to make up their own as they go through life .   "" trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding .

1|"known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with "" pretty woman , "" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone .  the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film's two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable .  the other winning element that makes "" pretty woman "" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today's films as it is here .  edward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel .  stopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions .  agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor .  this meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he'd rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night .  just as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear .  the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers .  since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss .  allegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , "" pretty woman "" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la "" cinderella . ""  the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been .  you honestly don't need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha .  the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner .  and yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , "" pretty woman "" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers .  you'd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i've seen on film in the 1990's .  additionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts .  playing sex symbols throughout the '80s with such pictures as "" american gigolo "" and "" an officer and a gentleman , "" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa .  julia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988's well-received "" mistic pizza "" and 1989's "" steel magnolia , "" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence .  it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing .  after "" pretty woman , "" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released "" runaway bride , "" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder .  roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star .  an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances .  no only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path .  on the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel's lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty .  another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days .   "" pretty woman "" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you'd expect , and wouldn't have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances .  this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem .  helped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian's best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie's overall fulfillment , "" pretty woman "" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy .

1|seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8 . 50 .  [theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture]   ( critic's note : this review is the longest i've ever written and still only scratches the surface .  i'd recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . )  as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace' - how do i even write this review ?  never mind the fact that i've been waiting for a new `star wars' movie since i was seven years old .  never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released .  never mind that there's so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn't cover everything .  and also like ted does in all of his reviews , i'll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader .  before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs ) .  as has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one ) .  george lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , ' `the empire strikes back' and `return of the jedi' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically .  in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can't recall his reasons .  with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . .  second trilogy . . .  well you know what i mean ) .  and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution .  [critic's note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule .  critic's note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it's not what a movie is about , but how it is about it . '  because so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ]  first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it .  we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire .  we know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . '  we also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) .  what we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth .  to me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity .  also , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended .  most notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine .  for those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) .  with `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights .  unfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained .  i didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness .  if you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) .  but i digress .  i've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself .  all these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself .  what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s .  its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality .  the basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times .  we're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo .  we're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly .  we're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) .  the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) .  the leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears .  he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series .  sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person .  clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers .  i have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) .  but it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along .  the film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another .  there are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook .  the other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting .  the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits .  as we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story .  and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council .  to briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation .  their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force .  jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves .  this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before .  in fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before .  the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary .  by the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot .  it's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence .  not that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history .  and at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter .  it does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society .  `the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness .  so many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited .  but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies .  |0.04225333333333333|0.8106666666666668|0.7666666666666666|The overall sentiment is mixed, with praise for the film's nostalgic and enjoyable elements, but criticism of its lack of originality and depth.
1|"the story of us , a rob reiner film , is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films .  well , 1999 has two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty .  the story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry .  the story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , "" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? ""  the film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are "" him "" and "" her "" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are "" us "" ( during the good times ) .  the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day .  ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don't want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don't , love each other anymore .  ben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage .  katie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn't mind doing things differently than they were planned .  the story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks .  as the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage .  this method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart .  through the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character's eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters .  the screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson's films , stepmom .  the script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must .  if it wasn't for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year's best picture .  bruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer's the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script .  although i wouldn't pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film's most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season .  where to start about michelle pfeiffer ?  pfeiffer's performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism .  pfeiffer's performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart's of any viewer that has watched this moving film .  the story of us is one of 1999's most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked .  superb acting , direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall .  the film's major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like "" it's over , "" or "" i hate you , "" you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an "" us . ""  the bottom line : a wonderful , enchanting , and heartbreaking film .  one of the most realistic , heartbreaking films in recent years .

( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . )  the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . )  and seeing beatty as a 'homeboy' has to be seen to be believed .  it's nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself .  second best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps .  halle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator .  also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she's also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun .  and , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself .  the writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par .  the direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well .  the script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever .  they're not cringe inducing , at least .  the script makes many points about society in america today , and isn't afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system .  best of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining .  there's also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes .  bulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws .  perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it's irrelevant .  in fact , there's very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected .  bulworth , then , is well worth watching .  a david wilcock review ? 1999   "" you know , for kids "" - norville barnes  "|0.8666666666666667|0.9166666666666666|0.8000000000000002|The overall sentiment of the explanations is very positive, highlighting Warren Beatty's performance, the film's humor, thought-provoking nature, writing, directing, and rap soundtrack, ultimately praising the film's strengths and positive rating.
1|"the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs .  doubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting .  it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989's dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive .  his next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster .  and so , after a six-year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams .  williams is the title character , hunter "" patch "" adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting .  we're introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies .  it's at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people .  he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia's medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade .  his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch's appearance before the state medical board .  the characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense .  although the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there's little story to be told outside of patch's skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters .  at medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch's zest for humanity .  the two instantly become the best of friends , and it's easy to see why .  monica potter plays patch's love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school .  for some reason he's attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view .  the script -- based on hunter adams' own story -- works well this way .  the rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid .  director tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patch's life in a sound , intentional manner ; combined with williams' presence on screen , the movie rarely becomes boring .  patch adams' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming , and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours , there's little feeling of continuity or the passage of time .  nevertheless , it's an emotionally moving picture , and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season .  it succeeds at everything it tries , and only fails at the stuff it doesn't try in the first place .  by and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams , but more importantly , it's entertainment for the entire family .
