0|capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything .  a time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with .  it is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why .  right from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible .  a pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead .  after their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial .  mcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics .  the acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have .  sandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box .  the most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part .  i always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact .  there is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this .  because the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting .  one of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic .  i was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter .  the movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes .  first of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma .  he's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade .  the old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story .  it just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics .  another mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character .  i'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible .   ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . )  is jackson's character then simply insane ?  that prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either .  one of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information .  mcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense .  how did the prosecution get this information ?  how come he didn't get it ?  the whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion .  this is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters .  it's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending .  at two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter .  it's all handwaving .  the closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair .  it's not easy to make a movie about something .  the other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) .  a time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time .  |-0.69|0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is that ""A Time to Kill"" is a negatively received movie, criticized for being poorly written, lacking in depth and character development, ineffective in addressing social issues, muddled, poorly acted, lacking in impact, contrived, and manipulative."
0|" "" deep rising "" gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films .  while dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring's "" anaconda "" -- "" deep rising "" has no tongue to put in its cheek .  folks , we're only a month into the new year , and already here's a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases .  most of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen "" titanic , "" then maybe they'd have known to stay home ) when it's attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature .  the only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members .  a mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby .  but what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful .  the main problem with "" deep rising "" is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory .  the concept is "" leviathan "" meets "" titanic , "" with a dash of "" speed 2 "" thrown in for good ( or is that bad ? )  measure .  this monster is equal parts "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea "" and "" the relic , "" knows how to open doors like the raptors from "" jurassic park "" and even gets to expel a half-digested victim ( a neat effect , admittedly ) a la the giant snake in "" anaconda . ""  some of the attack sequences are straight out of "" jaws "" and "" alien . ""  a scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of "" alien resurrection . ""  there's even a jet ski chase like "" hard rain . ""  and the list goes on .  watching "" deep rising "" 's cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy .  williams is affable enough , but his finnegan just isn't believable .  an interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted ; pretty famke janssen , best known as "" goldeneye "" 's killer thighs , is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams , while kevin j . o'connor , as finnegan's mechanic , provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast .  djimon honsou , who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december's "" amistad , "" pops up in a brief part .  he needs to stay away from the water .  the movie's final shot is a groaner , as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on-ship saboteur .  as if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate isn't bad enough ( when you taunt the monster , you're really asking for it ) , "" deep rising "" is a slow , stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot .  and since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn't out of the question .

0|" "" mandingo "" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , "" a trashy potboiler "" that "" appeals only to the s&m crowd . ""  actually , i think "" mandingo "" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts .  it's too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash .  the story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) .  one day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) .  although the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley .  according to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves .  hammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him .  hammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves .  meanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild .  hammond , however , is happier spending nights with his "" bed wench , "" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex .  it is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche .  hammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had "" pleasured "" her before he did .  of course , it's fine that he's slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a "" white lady , "" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her .  so blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen .  blanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child .  hammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it's okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche .  hammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water .  yes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive .  judging only by the plot , "" mandingo "" is pure sexploitation .  the main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society .  when "" mandingo "" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs .  dramatically , "" mandingo "" is weak and unfocused , and historically it's mostly confused .  if one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics .  not once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants .  the men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner .  there is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but "" mandingo's "" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there's plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) .  some tried to write off "" mandingo "" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it's not that easy .   "" mandingo "" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as "" the bible "" ( 1966 ) , the remake of "" king kong "" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated "" dune "" ( 1984 ) .  the director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including "" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea "" ( 1954 ) and "" fantastic voyage "" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as "" the narrow margin "" ( 1952 ) .  the script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on "" serpico . ""  james mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career .  so why is "" mandingo "" so bad ?  a number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job .  wexler's script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( "" yessuh , massuh "" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( "" fer whut're you gittin' outta bed ? "" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( "" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! "" ) .  fleischer's direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable .  nevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due .  despite its exploitative nature , "" mandingo "" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery .  until then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery .  even classics such as "" gone with the wind "" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter .   "" mandingo "" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn't all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets .  but all this is constantly undermined by the film's negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners .  with a little more maturity and different handling , "" mandingo "" might have been an effective , worthwhile film .  while it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them .  the issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler's script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing .  there is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but "" mandingo "" never does it .  steven spielberg touched on that same topic in "" schindler's list "" ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid .  the difference between that film and "" mandingo "" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma .   "" mandingo "" is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its "" trashy potboiler "" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished .

0|"the above is dialogue from this film , taken almost completely in context , and not jazzed up a bit to make it more inept than it is .  it is spoken between two of the protagonists somewhere in the film , and basically serves as a perfect example of what this film is about , especially if you realize that this exchange is meant to be taken seriously .  mr . gregg "" i'm-having-a-mid-life-crisis "" araki , the writer and director of this film , wants to show how important teenagers are , and wants to show how they feel in such a horrible , horrible world .  and how does he show it ?  by really cheap surrealism , and moronic exchanges like this .  oh , and it gets better .  a similar bit of dialogue is said in the middle of , oh i dunno , the fiftieth sex scene in this film ( i'm not counting the several masturbation scenes ) .  in it , one of the protagonists is humping away on top of another , and he says to her something along the lines of "" do you ever wonder what life is all about ? ""  sorry , man : foreplay takes place before the act of coitus .  of course , what do you expect : the film was written and directed by a guy who can't even spell his first name right ( yes , i know it's a cheap joke , but it had to be done ) .   "" the doom generation "" is advertised as a road trip movie about people who go around killing others who attack them , and also as another "" teen angst "" film ( one of the slogans is "" teen is a four-letter word "" - hardy har har ) .  it's a film about two angsty teens - amy blue ( rose macgowan , who would later play the buxom tatum in "" scream "" ) and jordon white ( james duval , who would go on to play randy quaid's son in "" independence day "" ) - who pick up an angsty homicidal maniac , xavier red ( jonathan schaech , who would go on to play the angsty lead guitarist in "" that thing you do ! ""  - and by the way , do you get the symbolism ?  red , white , and blue ?  huh ?  huh ? ) , and go on a road trip where three things happen , in no order : 1 ) they have sex ; 2 ) they run into weird people ; 3 ) they kill them .  the film is basically a remix of a bunch of other far superior films .  gregg araki obviously has seen such films as "" easy rider , "" "" natural born killers , "" and "" kalifornia , "" and tries to borrow elements from all these films and make something which is like a pop culture reference guide .  but what he forgets is these films either represented something that this film does not , or that they dug deep into their subjects and brought something out of them to make them deeper .   "" the doom generation "" doesn't want to do this ; it just wants to show everything in a surreal manner for the sole reason that araki does not want to deal with them on any kind of real level .  he wants to show everything in a weird manner , and forgets what the scenes are supposed to be about .  here's one scene , an earlier scene in the film : amy and jordan go into a quick-e mart type place to get food and other stuff .  amy is smoking , and the clerk , an asian man mind you ( i love how racist this film is , i really do ) , tells her to put it out .  she tells him to fuck off or something to that note .  he points a shotgun at her , and she puts it out reluctantly .  jordan makes two hot dogs , and takes them to the counter .  the cash register rings up "" 6 . 66 ""   ( oh , and this symbolism doesn't stop here ) .  jordan checks for his wallet but it's really in the car .  he asks amy for it , but she left her wallet in the car as well .  the clerk brings out his shotgun again and asks for the money .  they say they don't have it .  he gets ready to kill them , but then xavier , who they ditched in the middle of nowhere a scene before , pops out of nowhere , fights with the clerk , and ends with him blowing the clerk's head clean off ( clean wound , mind you ) .  the head is shown flying through the air , and lands in a fryer , where it begins to scream .  i don't really object to this kind of sick violence , but this scene is in the film for one reason and one reason only : to gross you out .  araki thinks that if he takes everything to the extreme , he'll make some kind of art .  wrong .  it takes a kind of resistance to make gore art .  when george romero made "" dawn of the dead , "" a very gory flick even for today , he had control over everything and still was able to make everything sick .  same goes for peter jackson's disgustingly gory "" dead alive , "" which features a 30 minute long fest of blood , guts , dismemberments , flesh chewing , and other assorted stuff , all ending with a guy with a lawn mower strapped to his body , taking out all sorts of zombies .  it was sick , but it was also satirical , and controled .  a scene like this has no purpose in the film , and it sticks out from everything else that happens .  here's a couple other scenes : jordan and amy have sex in a bath tub and xavier watches , masturbates , and then licks the semen from his hand ; xavier and amy have sex and jordan watches from the window , masturbates , and falls backwards ; a man attacks the trio , and is stabbed in the crotch by a giant sword ( put there just so this could happen ) ; a fast food employee stalks the trio , and his arm is shot off by xavier ; and various other annoyances .  also , look for about a million camoes from a wide assortment of people , who probably didn't really know what they were getting into when they signed up to do it ( just like peter o'toole , helen mirren , malcolm macdowell , and john gielgud probably didn't when they signed to be in "" caligula "" ) .  people such as indie actors parker posey and nicky katt , alternative rock stars skinny puppy and perry farrel , hollywood madam heidi fleiss , christopher "" peter brady "" mcknight , amanda bearse , and margaret cho all grace the screen for a matter of seconds , then disappear so that we can return to the annoying main plot line .  why are they here ?  so that we can all point to them and say "" hey , look it's ( fill in the blank ) !  wow ! ""  gimme a break .  the film's meaning is pretty easy to detect : that , you know , teens are so precious , and the world is such a horrible place , that when the two entities collide , there's a giant explosion of horrific violence .  otherwise defined as "" teen angst , "" or the belief that being a teenager is a horrible thing and that the world is too bad for you .  look , i'm 19 years old .  i went through a very brief teen angst thing which curiously lasted about as long as my taste in nirvana did .  i've since moved on to "" i don't really know what to do with my life "" phase , but the teen angst phase is something which is so annoyingly sophomoric and ignorant that any film that thinks they're dealing with it on any kind of serious level is just beating the wrong horse .  part of being a teen is experimenting , and testing the waters .  it's not whining about how awful parents are , and purposely feeling dispondent .  this is what the characters in this film do , and the film wants to show how they're these great people who are being punished by the world because they're teenagers , and how they try to defend themselves but can't totally overcome them .  it's not their fault they kill people ; it's the world's !  what they really need is a reality check .  the world is a bad place , and teenagers can be easily harmed because they are experimenting .  but part of it is taking everything that happens to you and learning from it .  the film thinks that teenagers are basically doomed , and there's nothing they can do about it .  hence the title .  not only does it have bad fallacy , but it can't even express this in an intelligent and coherent manner .  everything's overly surreal , and all we get are scenes of graphic violence and graphic sex .  how does xavier licking semen off his hand express teen angst ?  how does a talking decapitated head show that teens are dispondent because the world makes them this way ?  and why does the film constantly go back to the teen angst issue of the film ?  if araki had any kind of competence in writing or direction , he'd show them for what they really are .  and if he didn't want the satirical approach , he'd show the real problems with the world .  and if you still don't think that "" the doom generation "" is incompetent on every single possible level it could be , take the acting .  rose macgowan is horrible .  yes , she proved herself talented in "" scream , "" but she's so bad in "" the doom generation "" that if i had not seen her in "" scream , "" i would have christened her one of the worst actresses working in films today .  her entire performance is one-note ( bitchy ) , and the one scene where she cries over a dead animal is so forced that it's laughable .  equally bad is jonathan schaech , who wants to be the slacker serial killer : someone who doesn't have any remorse because emotions cause some kind of strain .  his performance is annoying as hell , and granted , he was better in "" that thing you do ! ""  and then there's james duval .  let's just say he makes keanu reeves look like brando .  he has the same kind of slacker stuttering , only much much much worse , and every line he says is so bad that i have now deemed him "" least talented actor in the world . ""  i have seen lots of bad actors , but james duval has got to be the worst .  or at least somewhere up there .  here's another example of a bad scene , if you're still not convinced : the film opens up in a club where they're playing nine inch nail's most banal song , "" heresy "" ( example of the lines : "" god is dead/and no one cares/if there is a hell/i'll see you there "" ) , and as the song plays , and red strobe lights show the patrons dancing , the film pans over to amy , just standing there , looking dispondent .  the film closes in on her , she looks right at the camera and says "" fuck . ""  no explanation of this should be necessary .  and finally , a note to gregg : grow up .  really .  move out of your parent's basement , read something other than salinger , and get a day job .  and don't quit it .

0|" "" ladybugs "" is a typical comedy that relies on three supposed guarantees : the pathetic team who beats the champs ; cross dressing ; and the presence of rodney dangerfield .  this picture doesn't play like a comedy for children , so who is it aimed at ?  and why is it told like a 91-minute sit-com instead of a feature film ?  rodney dangerfield stars as chester lee , a total schmuck working at a huge corporation .  he obviously doesn't have a lot of self esteem and thinks he has to kiss up to get ahead , which he does by volunteering to coach the company's girls' soccer team .  what a shock to learn chester and his assistant julie ( jackee ) know absolutely nothing about the game , and the players seem to know even less .  i didn't laugh , but for some reason it didn't annoy me that much .  chester's fiancee bess ( graff ) thinks he got a promotion in addition to the coaching position , and of course she has a slacker for a son who is doing poorly in school and is kicked off the sports teams .  jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew , who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester ( probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team - what original story ideas ! ) .  what we get is just another retread of the "" underdog sports team "" mixed with some cross dressing .  unfortunately , the film isn't smart enough to play upon the drag aspect .  in fact , it downplays it so heavily it's totally unbelievable .  could it be any more obvious martha is a boy ?  he only wears a girl's wig , without any makeup , and they don't even give him falsies .  brandis doesn't bother to mimic a girl's voice either .  then there is a pointless scene where chester and matthew shop for a dress , but for what reason ?  martha is only seen on the soccer field , why would they buy a dress for her ?  just when we think the martha character is going to be useful , she disappears , and the story wanders aimlessly looking for a new plot to pick up on .  when bess discovers what's really going on she breaks up with chester , and the relationship is forgotten about and the film focuses on the soccer team and the tension between chester and his boss .  this film could've been less bad had it been the cliche sports comedy , but it feels the need to go off on tangents that are completely unnecessary ( and bad at that ) .  there's just too much of a sit-com feel here , especially during the so-called serious moments , and all the confusion between the characters .  i've seen worse movies than "" ladybugs , "" but for some reason it contained some sort of bizarre charm , so even when it turns sour it doesn't seem as bad as it is .  dangerfield finally gets his respect in the end , but at what a price .

0|the happy bastard's quick movie review  the concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really .  shift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control .  sadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there's something about mary and dumb and dumber .  since the duo directed and didn't write the script , i can assume that's part of the problem .  the story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world .  his popularity has gone through the roof and he's getting his career off the ground .  then , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything .  these two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed's abandoned him and he's about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine .  forward seventeen years later , where roy has become quite the loser , complete with mechanical hand , torn-up car , and , of course , the occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while .  however , he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley , where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid ) , who has quite the bowling arm .  with the kid's help , he figures he can be known again , particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno , nevada .  of course , the amish kid needs some coaxing , particularly when you consider , well , he's amish .  this leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow .  finally , the duo get on the road and , along the way , pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel ) .  the main problem i had with kingpin wasn't the fact it wasn't funny .  in fact , it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it , such as the aformentioned above and roy's explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? ) .  but that's just it- scenes .  there's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie , like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex-boyfriend .  i mean , was this really necessary ?  couldn't have this been handled just a bit wackier ?  i mean , this is a comedy , why throw ethics in ?  particularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle , where hair gel can be easily mistaken ?  that really ruined it , however , and that's too bad .  the acting is top notch , especially from angel and murray , and the really funny scenes are worth noting .  still , if you're going to think dumb , think dumb all the way through , ok ?  at least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i'd still be a little bit irked .  |-0.6000000000000001|0.8166666666666668|0.85|The analysis highlights some negative sentiment towards the film due to scenes that disrupt the comedic flow and the inclusion of unnecessary seriousness, but also acknowledges the top-notch acting and funny scenes.

0|"the catch phrase for disney's rocket man is one spoken by fred z . randall ( harland williams ) , the bumbling idiot computer programmer turned astronaut who continuously wreaks havoc everywhere he goes .   "" it wasn't me ! "" he proclaims over and over as the aftermath of his stupidity brings about looks of disgust from the others .  well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is , williams can't take all the blame , but he sure can't justify himself with his own simple tag line either .  fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy , turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide-eyed at a poster of the earth .  as a 30-year-old , fred hasn't grown up much , but at least he's somewhat closer to his goal , now designing astronaut software for nasa .  when an astronaut for an upcoming mission to mars becomes injured , nasa calls on the person who knows the programming inside and out to fill the void .   .   .  fred .  yes , although he's an obviously klutzy moron , nasa doesn't think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program , and time itself , has ever known .  for the first part of the film , we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park . he laughs , he screams , but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child's play .  his passive approach to the program eventually leads to many record-breaking feats , much to the dismay of cocky counterpart , mission commander captain overbeck ( william sadler ) , who once held the records .  overbeck will regretfully accompany fred and two others to the red planet , one being astronaut julie ford ( the stupids' jessica lundy ) , and the other being a chimpanzee who is much more civilized than our antagonizing protagonist .  from here on out , we are subjected to one lame gag after another , dealing with snot , laxatives , and flatulence .  you know , standard kid movie material .  almost sounding like a poor james stewart impressionist , williams is awful in his first starring role .  we get the feeling that if jerry lewis and pee-wee herman were related and produced an inbred offspring , williams would be it .  while he's not as annoying as other actors who cater to zany , stupid comedy , he's just as unlikeable .  to say it more understandably , jim carrey might annoy you more , but this guy is even less funny .  why ?  because while he possesses the stupidness needed to pull off such a role , his performance is too understated and boring .  classic comedic dunces were generally oblivious to their own idiocy .  stan laurel , for example , was so innocent in all his trouble-making that we were immediately fond of him .  peter sellers , as inspector clouseau , was so self-assured and confident that when he did something as simple as trip , it was humor at it's best .  williams , on the other hand , can't garner the pity he needs to make us love him in all his anti-glory .  as for the rest of the cast , including some bigger names in smaller roles ( beau bridges and shelley duvall ) , nobody is worth watching whatsoever .  this is just another example of the fast-food equivalent of cinema : mass-produced , less than mediocre , over priced , and hard to stomach .  giving it one-and-a-half stars is * extremely * generous , but even i'll admit to laughing a few times .  the amazing thing is that even in a theater packed with little kids , laughter was something rarely heard - even from the children !  i must admit that it gave me more respect for the kids when they didn't crack up over every little thing .  then again , maybe they were asleep .  some people might think critics are harsh on kid movies , claiming adults aren't the targeted audience and therefore aren't meant to , and won't , enjoy them .  sadly , it's also true that kids will enjoy almost anything if it's presented right .  a two-hour still shot of a dog with a cartoonish voice over could entertain a lot of toddlers out there , but would that make it as artistic as beauty and the beast , which could easily do the same thing ?  and saying that a parent's perspective isn't important is quite a poor theory to have when they're the ones who take the kids to these films in the first place .

0|"based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad , victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers , heyst ( william dafoe ) and alma ( irene jacob ) , who seek refuge on heyst's isolated island .  however , their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones ( sam neil ) , martin ricardo ( rufus sewell ) and their servant , pedro ( graziano marcelli ) , who have come to steal heyst's rumoured plunder .  while the novel is largely complex in characterization , the film sadly transposes conrad's characters into lacklustre leads , the most disappointing being heyst himself .  conrad's heyst adheres religiously to his late father's ways of detachment and isolation .  his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma , a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice .  the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude , however , is lost in mark peploe's ( director and writer ) diluted version of heyst .  without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst's character , all that is left of conrad's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement .  on the one hand , actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task ( though not impossible ) , but on the other hand , dafoe's flat acting cannot be excused as an attempt at stoicism .  in the end , we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another .  the final transformation , while perceptible , lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad's novel .  its absence in the film is unforgivable .  the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers .  alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship , namely heyst's underlying philosophy of detachment , which heyst himself grapples with .  the struggle against heyst's ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma's love for him .  jacob , fair-skinned , gentle and yet passionate , handles the role with precision , detailing nuances where possible .  unfortunately , she is let down by a superficial script .  the couple's relationship develops too hastily , leaving all subtlety effaced and replaced with a blatant show-and-tell approach .  all we know of the characters are mostly explained by their lines alone .  this is unsatisfactory when so much of the turmoil experienced by the two stem from their buried thoughts and emotions .  the sketchy handling of their relationship stands out as sorely as dafoe's american accent ( an inappropriate one since heyst spent most of his life in london ) .  the other characters such as schomberg ( jean yanne ) , the owner of a hotel , and mr jones ( sam neill ) , also fall short of conrad's meticulous characterization .  while schomberg should have been more menacing and vindictive , mr jones should have been portrayed as something more of an enigma .  sam neil's caricature of a slightly stout , effeminate and soft-spoken gentleman-at-large nullifies the effect intended by conrad who describes mr jones as "" an insolent spectre on leave from hades , endowed with skin and bones and a subtle power of terror "" .  poor characterization aside , kudos goes to rufus sewell for his excellent portrayal of ricardo , secretary to mr jones , a reckless ruffian capable of murder .  sewell , with his cockney accent and large expressive green eyes , becomes the true terror of the unholy trinity , masterminding deceitful plans behind jones' back .  at the same time , we are entertained by the foolhardiness of his plans .  despite the authentic setting and marvellous cinematography by bruno de keyzer , very few images are left behind for us to savour after the film has ended .  sourabaya and its surrounding islands and volcanoes may have their charm , but mean nothing once the film fails to capture the essence of an epic , which is what victory deserves to be .  the delicately inter-woven complexities in the love story are lost to an inadequate production .  at the end of the film , we are told that perhaps alma's victory was in teaching heyst how to love .  a hollow victory indeed .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

0|chill factor is a carbon copy of speed with one notable exception : instead of a speeding bus , we now have an ice cream truck .  the truck is driven by arlo ( cuba gooding jr . ) and mason ( skeet ulrich ) , who have been instructed by a dying scientist to transport a deadly chemical weapon to a military base by the name of fort mcgruder .  this particular weapon ( nicknamed `elvis' ) must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees , or else the shockwave will goo-iffy everything in a mile radius .  that would be pretty nasty .  the power of elvis is revealed in the opening scene , as dr . richard long ( david paymer ) conducts a test on an isolated tropical island .  long accidentally melts 18 soldiers and defoliates virtually the entire island , due to an enormously miscalculated safety distance .  the commanding officer , general brynner ( peter firth ) , is sentenced to 10 years in prison for the murder of his troops .  upon his release , the general is intent on tracking the good doctor down , snatching elvis , and selling the weapon to the highest international bidder .  protecting the fate of the world is a drifting hamburger flipper ( ulrich ) and a feisty ice cream delivery man ( gooding jr . ) , who must elude brynner's men and get elvis to safety at fort mcgruder .  all the while , of course , they must keep the weapon below 50 degrees .  this proves to be tricky .  among the wild adventures arlo and mason partake in is a trip down a tree-covered mountainside in a boat , and a fist fight on top of a moving vehicle .  they also crack a few dozen witty retorts that we are supposed to find amusing .  to put it simply , i'll use a clever pun : chill factor should be put on ice .  director hugh johnson has mixed elements from speed , broken arrow and the lethal weapon series to create a lifelessly bland cocktail of a chase movie .  when there is some occasional action , the audience seems oddly detached from it .  perhaps that's because we've already waded through a pool of clich ? s and boring dialogue ; all material that's been used before , and with a lot more spice .  take the villains , for example .  they are typical stereotypes of every terrorist that has ever walked the silver screen .  they speak lines that have been recycled profusely from one movie to the next , divulge important plot details while holding their enemies at gunpoint , and act in very predictable ways .  the tag-team of gooding jr . and ulrich sounds much more exciting than it is .  frankly , i'm not sure i can accept cuba as an ice cream man .  i suppose it's better than him dressed like a giant hot dog , selling jumbo frankfurters on a street corner .  gooding displays one single emotion in this movie , which is frequently on display in lines like `i'm gonna get on yo ass like last year's underwear ! ' and the incessant sputtering of `oh , sh * t ! '  this is virtually the same character he played in jerry maguire and as good as it gets .  but where gooding was once an exciting actor , he now seems dull and endlessly monotonous .  at least he's a bit more captivating than ulrich , who has all the film's worst dialogue , but does nothing noticeable to enliven his character .  the supporting cast , which includes every personality you expect to pop up , is also wasted .  to be fair , there are a few brief moments of serviceable action .  and i did chuckle a few times .  one example is when ulrich ( an employee at `darlene's diner' ) is at the counter when brynner walks through the door .  `you own this place ? '  the general asks .  `yeah , ' ulrich says .  `they call me darlene . '  these little tidbits of humor are ( mainly ) welcome in this weak , disappointing wreckage of an action film .  as a speed clone , it could have benefited from a lot more suspense and perhaps ( god forbid ) even some decent writing .  sadly , i walked away from chill factor only wondering how much fun it could have been .  |-0.6333333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is negative, as they criticize the movie ""Chill Factor"" for being a bland and disappointing chase movie with predictable dialogue and dull performances, lacking suspense and failing to deliver on its potential."

s are also the order of the day with mission to mars .  dialogue and character motivations are all lifted directly from countless other science fiction films that have all done it better and with more style ( even independence day , which lifted all of it's premises from other sci-fi films was better than this film , and i don't like independence day ) .  films like 2001 : a space odyssey , the abyss , and close encounters of the third kind are all blatantly stolen from ( and poorly at that ) .  there is even a sequence where a rover is traveling through a canyon , and i couldn't help but whisper "" u'tinni "" to myself and wait for a jawa to quickly hide in the rocks before the rover could get a glimpse of it .  this film also features one of my all-time least favorite movie clich ? s : the "" he would have wanted you to have this "" moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on ) .  scenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating .  ennio morricone's music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing .  his music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes .  at other times his music is unbearably over-dramatic .  one sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won't reach its intended target .  mission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme .  events are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience .  we are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest .  what makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle , except to invoke an emotional response ( i could think of at least one way to save him , and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be "" smarter "" than i am ) .  during the finale , when we are finally introduced to the translucent , conehead , kitty-faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn ) .  a brief history lesson about "" where we came from "" is proffered , then sinise is whisked away to be with "" the rest of our people "" ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that "" this is a chance to step foot where no one else has "" ) .  >from the press i've been seeing this film receive , it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater .  i'm sure the first weekend or two will be huge , but once word gets out people will stop going .  let's just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn't hurt by the negativity this film is generating .  i'd venture to say it won't be worse than this waste of time .

0|"retrospective : city of the living dead ( 1980 )  a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 mike watson  i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as "" dim-witted "" .  and by golly , just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead .  although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career , this is not one of them .  two points in the movie's favour - the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi - keep things from falling totally into the abyss , but by and large city of the living dead is a failure .  and like most cinematic failures , it comes down to bad writing , dumb performances and lousy direction .  the story starts in new york when , during a seance , a medium ( katherine mccoll ) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich , massachusetts .  for reasons we won't go into here , this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth .  the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance , but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist ( christopher george ) .  that scene in itself is a howler : why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside ?  and don't cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they're buried ?  anyway , off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world , where various grisly goings-on are already happening as all saints day approaches .  fulci's graphic gore is in evidence once again , but here it only serves to further highlight the film's flimsy script and plodding direction .  the dialogue , in all manner of speaking , is unspeakable .  not bad in the quotable sense , like an ed wood film , but bad in its sheer dullness or blatantly obvious "" lets explain the plot "" type approach .  mccoll doesn't have a clue who her character is : deadly serious one minute , frivolous the next , she at times is genuinely hard to watch .  and the geezer ( the actor's name escapes me ) who plays the town psychiatrist becomes even harder to stomach than mccoll as the film progresses .  christopher george's performance is salvageable , but he gets his brains ripped out in the end by a zombie and we don't care .  in fact we don't care for anyone in city of the living dead , though in other fulci films that hasn't mattered so much when he was on form as a stylist and an ideas man , as he was in the beyond .  as a director , some of fulci' idiosyncrasies are incredibly silly and annoying here .  he constantly uses extreme close-ups of people's eyes , a ridiculous technique which suggests an attempt to convey the emotion that his dialogue and actors aren't capable of .  and despite some gruesome violence , he barely manages a single scare in the entire film .  long-time collaborator fabio frizzi , talented but always erratic , offers a patchy soundtrack that veers between eerie , gothic death marches and woefully inappropriate electro-pop that's quite frankly embarrassing .  fulci's other films of this period may be flawed - house by the cemetery , the beyond , the black cat - but they are nonetheless films with more inspiration , atmosphere and better dialogue than this turkey .  for completists only .

0|"years ago , robin williams made _jumanji_ , a brilliant achievement in special effects , but a travesty on nearly every other level .  the same can be said for _what dreams may come_ , a boring , illogical , weepie-wannabe that left my senses numb .  don't get me wrong : i love breathtaking special effects and pulse-pounding imagery .  _brazil_ is on my personal top ten .  _the city of lost children_ is a great film because of its outlandish scenarios .  i even love _2001_ and _last year at marienbad_ , being in the minority amidst my friends .  _what dreams may come_ , imagery aside , has little daring thought to complement its imagery .  the daring thought it _does_ have is never fully realized .  it's idea of a plot is so lukewarm , that it insults the bigger questions it raises .  it would have been better if the filmmakers rid the film of the live action sequences , put on an electronica soundtrack , and sell it as one of those popular _mind's eye_ videos .  robin williams plays chris nielsen , who dies too prematurely--not only in the story , but before we have a chance to really know and care for him .  the director , vincent ward , and the screenwriter ronald bass , have chosen to tell his life story in flashbacks while having the foreground story focus on his experience with the afterlife .  big mistake .  it would have been far better to take the half-hour or so needed to tell his life story first ( ala _it's a wonderful life_ ) , so that i can build up respect for him , so i could know and possibly care for him , his children , and his long-suffering wife ( played superbly by annabella sciorra ) .  instead , the filmmakers insult my intelligence by rushing into the story , expecting that the film to grow in depth as it progresses .  it doesn't .  so in the afterlife , chris learns that ( a ) people still don't meet god , ( b ) that our thoughts are reality , and ( c ) time does not exist there .  hmm . . .  i+ll grant one of those silly giant ideas for the sake of the narrative .   ( the "" not meeting god "" part still irks at me , but perhaps there was no possible way to film it and give it due respect ) .  that said , this alternate reality still makes no possible sense .  read on . . .  chris' wife commits suicide .  since suicides go to hell , chris would be separated from his wife forever .  the important question is , is heaven really heaven if you are separated from the one you love ?  good question .  and i like good thought-provoking questions .  i don+t like it when the filmmakers deviate from the question .  i _loathe_ it when the filmmakers deviate from the question so that the film becomes a popular rescue film , especially a rescue film which does not take its underlying premise seriously .  i _really_ loathe it when it+s story is no longer run by logic , but by special effects .  hey chris : did you forget ?  your thoughts are _real_ .  they are more _real_ than the physical world , according to the new-age screenplay .  so , why don+t you conjure up positive thoughts of annie , and let that run wild ?  and then she would appear before you , and you two would live in happy bliss for eternity ?  because there would be no movie , that+s why .  and albert the angel ( played by miscast cuba gooding , jr . ) says bluntly : "" that+s fantasy . ""  umm . . .  if your thoughts are more real than the physical , then fantasy is not fantasy , but real .  surely some eastern meditation specialist would be able to tell you that .  and if you happen to think that you are an unimaginative person , and that your thoughts aren't big enough to sustain you for eternity , well , in all due respect , that's why i don't subscribe to this theology .  all due respect .  another idea , based on "" time , ( pause ) , does not exist here ! ""  so chris , spend your eternity with annie , as she is on earth , reliving your favorite memories , or hang out with her when she was growing up .  you+ve got eternity : perhaps you can hang around long enough and learn not to freak her out .  and forcing her to write "" i still exist "" in her diary , imo , is just too tacky .  there are many other ideas , all of which are a hundred times better than what+s unraveled in the plot .  the great aforementioned question is sidetracked into gimmicky subplots that have been done before , and just come out stale .  most insulting is the subplot where important people in chris+ life appear in heaven differently than he expects , so when they finally show themselves , he realizes they were with him all along .  and when this happens , the film runs in slow motion , as if to build emotion .  _gag me with a spoon_ .  so the only things for me to like are sciorra+s effective performance , who rises far above this mundane material , and the special effects .  please note that while i enjoyed some of the visuals , i did not enjoy _all_ of them : some of the images looked like sandy duncan universe , everybody floating up and down in invisible strings .  it sounds like a joke , but it+s really true : i really tried to block out the dialogue , and figure out what music would best work as an alternative soundtrack .  my vote goes to a rare cd called "" never say die "" ( 1981 ) from petra , a christian rock group .  it+s pretty good , and they have a song about annie , who commits suicide .   ( it+s too late for annie/she+s gone away for good/there+s so much we'd have told her/and now we wish we could/but it+s too late . . . ) .  melancholic , yes .  depressing , yes .  but far more entertaining . . .  so , in case you don+t know , let me be straight .  suicide--bad .  _don+t do it_ .  no . no . no .

0|"the original _babe_ was my favorite movie of 1995 , a sleeper hit that transcended its target audience .  being a surprise commercial and critical success , it had no marketing tie-ins , which limited its final take .  thus , babe 2 arrives , with a budget greater than the money made in babe 1 .  plush dolls , vending machines hawking t-shirts , and macy's thanksgiving day balloons arrive for holiday money-grubbing .  too late .  this is a sad review to write , because babe 2 not only does _not_ live up to the original , but it doesn't even come to a fraction of it .  i shouldn't expect that sequels to modern fairy tales to match their predecessors' magic , but this film tries too hard , and loses its charm .  consider a driver applying the accelerator with great intensity , unaware that his car is in neutral .  imagine with me , if you will , _scream_'s jamie kennedy , explaining the "" rules "" for sequels like babe 2 .   ( 1 ) there must be _more_ talking animals .   ( 2 ) there must be _more_ slapstick comedy .   ( 3 ) there must be _more_ songs for those mice to sing : that's cute .   ( 4 ) keep the story cards to break up the action : that's cute too , even though "" the pig gets wise "" made no sense , given the context of that story partition .   ( 5 ) there must be action , however illogical , that will conjure up pivotal scenes from the original : the trademark song that nobody remembers the words to , the baa-ram-ewe secret code , the "" that'll do , pig .  that'll do . ""  now throw in the limitations : ( a ) james cromwell , now a hot commodity , has limited time on the set ( or maybe he didn't approve of the script ) .   ( b ) christine cavanaugh , the voice of the original babe , demands more money ( $200 , 000--paltry considering the $80 million budget ) .  out .  e . g .  daily comes in with noticable results .   ( c ) george miller , the director , is more well-known for his dark futuristic mad max films and his twilight zone segment , not for kiddie fare ( and no , he didn't direct that _andre_ film in '94 ) .   ( d ) the special effects are impressive , _but limited_ .  babe talks , but most of the time from a single shot , repeated over and over again .   ( babe is center screen , looking straight into the camera , with a happy smirk--regardless of whether he's happy , or scared , or tired ) .  season now with the "" original "" elements , which , as we will find out , are straight from the screenwriting-is-hell bin .   ( i ) change the venue into "" the big city "" .  this has been praised as wildly original .  excuse me : didn't _home alone_ do this several years ago ?  how about the muppets ?  even _the bad news bears_ travelled to tokyo .  sorry .  no dice .  side note : to give the city a fairy-tale look , george miller crafted a fantastical fantasyland that merges the landmarks of the world's great cities , and yes , it _is_ impressive .  but this too is over-used , repeating the same view over and again on multiple occasions .  and , for the most part , babe _remains in the hotel_ .   ( ii ) given the limitations of cromwell , the human element is taken over by "" the boss' wife "" played by magda szubanski .  s-t-r-e-t-c-h .  she's not a lead actress-type , she's not funny enough in her physical comedy , and she's simply embarrassing in some of her pratfalls .   ( have her arrested falsely on drug charges !  have her accidentally incite a riot with biker dudes and scantily clad babes !  have her bounce around on a bungee cord at a prestigious benefit dinner ! )  i was hoping for a little smirk during these scenes , but i felt sorry for the embarrassment that she put herself in .  i am restraining myself from talking about the dark nature of the film , the violence , the scene where a pit bull dangles from the bridge , head submerged underwater .  even the best fairy tales have a bit of the macabre in it , as the brothers grimm have demonstrated .  no . . . my problem is with the story , or lack thereof .  _babe_ is sent out to save the hoggett farm , but once in the city , that story is forgotten .  being a good-natured pig in the midst of the cynicism of his environs is nice , but , other than rescue that aforementioned pit bull , what did babe actually _do_ ?  without giving the ending away , the farm is saved from a left-field quirk that had nothing to do with the pig .  speaking of "" pig "" , or , "" pig-pig-pig-pig-pig ! "" .  the word "" pig "" is so overused , had they changed it to an expletive , and had the pig be al pacino , i could have been watching _scarface_ .  this is screenwriting ?  further , i cannot explain the deep gnaw at my gut in the many scenes where accidents happen to good people in fantastically elaborate setups .  had it been a cartoon , and the victim be an equivalent of elmer fudd , maybe my reaction would have been softened .  but to farmer hoggett ?  his wife ?  an elderly mickey rooney ?  much too irreverent .   ( "" quick !  splice those singing mice into those scenes ! "" ) .  the film isn't a colossal failure .  i did like glenne headley's schmoozy chimpanzee .  i liked the pink poodle .  the dog on the cart , who momentarily thinks he's in dog heaven .  and a weird looking guy who may have been doubly-cast as an airport employee and a judge .  but most of the time , i was looking down , in boredom , or in embarrassment over the hacked-up script .  them singing mice , those chapter partitions , the proficient acting of the animals-- none of these can compensate for a story .  let me spoil the final scene : farmer hoggett looks at pig , proud , says "" that'll do , pig .  that'll do .

0|at first i was intrigued by the strange cast and odd creatures on the galaxy quest trailer , but that was before i saw the film .  now my view has completely changed .  it's time to embrace for impact , because this is a very bumpy ride .  the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including : jason nesmith ( tim allen ) , alexander dane ( alan rickman ) , gwen demarco ( sigourney weaver ) signing autographs at a convention .  they meet fans who dress up in costumes , fans who worship the ground they walk on , and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris ( robin sachs ) .  of course they are unaware of this until they actually begin performing their duties , and meet the ugly aliens themselves .  thus begins the long adventure to help save the thermians .  the movie plays like a really bad star trek episode , in fact it's worse .  i don't even think trekkies will appreciate this weak spoof , because quite frankly it's just not funny .  all the jokes are basically collected observations from the series .  one such continuous joke involves a simple crew member who believes he will die in space , because no extra on the tv show ever lives , as proven in the star trek series .  creative jokes like this may seem like a clever idea , but not when they are used to death .  a person can only take so much .  we do not need to be tortured , especially when you have to pay for it .  it's pretty bad when even tim allen is pitiful .  it's not like i expected an oscar worthy performance form him , but a few laughs would have been helpful .  speaking of acting , 2 fine talents were wasted as well .  sigourney weaver was here to show cleavage , well at least it worked .  it's pretty bad when the only entertaining value of the film is cleavage .  it just shows you how disgraceful the film really is .  alan rickman however was not so lucky .  after his last hit ( dogma ) he embarrasses himself by doing this sloppy mess .  it's just a shame to see talented actors and actresses throw their ability away .  when the film couldn't get any worse , thankfully some nice special effects pop up .  like many big blockbusters ( armageddon , the haunting to name a few ) they rely heavily on effects to help boost the film's box office results .  times it works , but unfortunately we have to shell out hard earned money and suffer through this junk .  when will it stop ?  i am getting tired of being suckered into seeing such trash .  it may look fine and dandy , but we need to at least have a story .  is that too much to ask ?  obviously it is .  when galaxy quest finally ends , it literally crash lands .  aside from the impressive looking creatures from industrial light and magic , it's an embarrassment to the cast , and it's embarrassing to the science fiction genre .  it's not the least bit fun , nor was it entertaining .  the only place where this movie belongs is to infinity and beyond .  |-0.8333333333333334|0.8999999999999999|0.8666666666666667|"The reviewer's negative sentiment towards ""Galaxy Quest"" is based on their disappointment with the lack of humor, wasted talent, reliance on special effects, and absence of a cohesive story, leading to an overall negative review described as a ""sloppy mess"" and embarrassing."
0|"the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous as this summer's other comic book adaptation , batman and robin .  both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts , but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty-headed character motivations .  in panel-sized morsels , implausible plots and "" rambo "" -esque dialogue are often overshadowed by the artwork , but on thirty foot silver screens , it's much more difficult to dismiss the shallowness behind the pretty pictures .  spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons ( white ) who is framed by a corporate baddie ( played without irony by sheen ) , then set on fire and left for dead .  though the movie skimps on the next few plot points , here's what i could determine : said assassin then becomes the leader of satan's army , under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown ( leguizamo , grating as always ) .  he is renamed , for reasons unbeknownst , spawn , and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon .  but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child , he realizes that he can't be the evil superdemon he's expected to be , and he sets about avenging his untimely death .  typical of summer blockbusters , spawn is an effects-laden ninety minute rock video .  while the visions of hell are laughably crude ( think the virtual reality sequences of the lawnmower man ) , spawn's prehensile outfit and the action sequences are truly something to behold .  but the storytelling is completely lacking in emotion ( spawn longs for his wife , but they don't have a single scene together before simmons' death ! ) , conflict ( who will triumph is not anybody's guess ) , and believability ( not that i expected it ) .  so many questions are left unanswered , and i'm sure they won't be addressed in the inevitable sequel .  while last year's the crow : city of angels suffered similar problems with its narrative ( which was lazy and somewhat incoherent ) , it had atmosphere to spare and genuine moments of hypnotic power .  spawn is an in-your-face , screaming banshee of a film ; these guys know how to graft a comic book onto celluloid , but they haven't the faintest idea how to make a movie .

"" the sculptress "" is a scary proposition all right , but not in the way its producers intended .  from the outset it's easy to see why some of the larger , more reputable chains aren't carrying it : the film looks like a straight-to-video release from the early '80s that's been dusted off ( not very carefully ) and re-issued in theatrical format .  that staple of schlocky z-movies jeff fahey ( "" the lawnmower man "" ) plays a washed-up shakespearean actor lacking in some basic people skills .  when he's not reliving his glory days in his ramshackle nob hill apartment , screaming scotch-induced "" hamlet "" soliloquies well into the night , he's out and about on the streets of san francisco stalking loose women .  fahey's dobie sizes up his victims ( actually just one , a peep show performer name of sylvie ) dressed like one of the guys from kraftwerk , and approaches them in the ridiculous attire of a bavarian count replete with a cane , dark glasses , and a false beard ( just in time for halloween ! ) .   "" do you have a castle ? ""  sylvie asks dobie seductively when he flashes the bulging contents of his wallet outside a coffee shop .

""  the film's plot could have been just as easily condensed .   "" artist moves in next door to shakespearean psychopath . ""   "" yawns ensue .

0|the people who populate the movie 54 are shallow , self-absorbed and self-indulgent .  in other words , they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts .  54 is the story of that well-publicized new york disco , studio 54 , the in-place in the '70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled , photographed and pampered .  the difficulty with 54 , which was written and directed by mark christopher , is that his script takes no point of view .  christopher neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio 54's hallmark .  he keeps an uninvolved distance , thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists .  the movie's one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell , the famous owner of the nightspot .  he is part rebel , part dreamer , part shrewd entrepreneur .  he's smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele , yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs .  myers , in his first straight character part , is in turn appealing and appalling .  at one moment he can try to pressure a male employee into a sexual situation , then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man a handful of cash .  the story is told by shane o'shea ( ryan phillippe ) , a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple .  shades of john travolta's brooklyn-bound tony in saturday night fever .  eventually , shane does come to new york , attracts rubell's eye and is admitted to the promised land .  his looks get him a job as a busboy , and he is later promoted to the prestigious position of bartender , where he mixes with and makes drinks for the rich and famous .  shane's dream is to meet soap star julie black ( neve campbell ) , a fellow garden stater .  but both characters are so sketchily drawn that even when they do hook up , it's no big deal .  the chemistry between shane and julie is nonexistent .  54 is a very cold , uninvolving movie .  it's all strobe lights and glitz , all substance .  it's sort of like the musical era it covers .  |-0.7666666666666666|0.9|0.8333333333333334|The sentiment of the explanations is negative as they describe the people in the movie as shallow, self-absorbed, and self-indulgent.

0|"i've always been a kevin kline fan , silverado , fish called wanda , pirates of penzance , and even his hamlet on pbs' great performances .  the minute i saw the trailer for this film , i resolved to see it .  besides the fact that kline starred , it looked like a hilarious film .  i got sucker punched by the trailer to an extent , however , as i also thought , "" wow , if there's this much funny stuff in the trailer , there must be a ton of laughs in the rest of the film . ""   ( oops ) i packed up the wife and headed to les cinemas del diablo ( my name for our local multi-multi-plex . )  the film began . . . .  the film concerns an english/drama teacher at a suburban high school , named howard brackett .  he loves poetry and great literary works , but his class is more interested in his famous former student , played by matt dillon .   ( i'd put in his name , but my wife won't let me take notes during a movie and i've forgotten it . )  they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him .  brackett has been engaged to another teacher ( played by joan cusack ) for three years , and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her .  the wedding , however , becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual .  kline spends most of the first two-thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he isn't .  the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference .  his closest friends don't help matters , bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party .  there are some genuinely hilarous moments , one involving a tape geared towards helping men assert their masculinity .  kline is hounded by a gay reporter played by tom selleck , who waxes poetic on the benefits of coming out , while at the same time doing his best to exploit the situation for his own sleazy tabloid machinations .  the movie moves along fine and slowly builds to the climax of the wedding .  kline stands at the altar and is asked to take his vows . . .  if you want to be surprised , don't read , i am going to reveal the ending .   . . . instead of saying "" i do "" in front of his parents and most of the town , and even some cameras , he says "" i'm gay . ""  this is where the movie , in my opinion falls apart .  most of the humor in the film had come from kline's insistence that he was straight , while at the same time , loving poetry and being a senstivie guy , dressing well , and occaisionally acting prissy .  it reminded me of the "" effeminate heterosexual "" sketch from saturday night live .  it was funny , it was sustainably funny , and kline's performance made it doubly so .  however , after the wedding , the film drags on .  they should have attempted to come to a quick conclusion , but it then gets into the serious side of what he's done .  he reconciles with his parents and his friends , some of which had turned on him .  there are several scenes which seemed like a waste of time , the scene with his mother and her friends , which was hilarious , seemed pointless , and the scene with tom selleck in the bar with joan seemed pointless .  finally , even though i am not catholic , i found the scene with the priest to be condescending .  the preist cannot believe that a man was engaged for three years and had not consumated the relationship , proclaiming to brackett in the third person , "" he's gay . ""  it got a chuckle from the audience , but i was distracted by it , and began to tire of the film .  by the time the wedding had come and gone , i found myself hoping it would be over soon .   ( much like this review you are saying )  overall , if i have to quantify it , i say , rising action gets * * * * and climax and falling action gets .  see it in economy time .
