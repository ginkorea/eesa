0|"the last of vampire-films offers plenty of blood and gore , but beyond that - nothing .  jack crow ( james woods ) is a professional vampire slayer that is secretly working for the vatican .  his and his men's mission is to clean the earth from vampires .  they have lost count of how many vampires they have slaughtered , but one has always escaped them .  valek ( thomas ian griffith ) - the dark messias and ruler of the undead that is older than time itself .  for all eternity the vampires have searched for their salvation - the black cross .  with the cross in their possesion , the vampires will be able to walk in the sunlight .  after that it is either the humans or the vampires who will dominate the earth . . .  i have never liked john carpenter and his style .  after seeing this film , my opinions have not changed .  john carpenter remains john carpenter .  however , because of the film's self-irony , black humour and fascinating cinematography , i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long , long time .  neither the synopses or carpenter's direction are original .  but there are some things that are interesting .  the director's negative view on the catholic church , for instance .  at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba ( maximilian schell ) has simply used crow and his team to find valek , so that he would gain eternal life .  otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool - drinking , smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy .  carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere .  set in new mexican dessert , he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns , symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness .  more than anything in this film , this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil .  the cinematography by gary b . kibbe is probably the film's greatest achievement .  music ( composed by john carpenter himself ) is at times effective , the special effects and makeup are likewise worth a notice .  when it comes to the cast ( in an intellectual film like this casting is the last problem ; everyone can scream and swing the axe ! ) , but here james woods is suprisingly convincing .  he is macho and cool as the dedicated hunter , who lost his family to the "" breed of evil "" .  woods is constantly overacting , which really saves the film from falling into the trap of serious self importance .  daniel baldwin is also entertaining as crow's loyal partner .  the other cast members are struggling .  because the film doesn't take itself too seriously , it stays afloat .  still it is like most vampire-films - a mediocre experience .

0|"i'm not sure who the genius is who came up with the idea of comparing "" disturbing behavior "" with "" scream .

""  i remember a film called "" white man's burden "" which dealt with a reversal of blacks and whites in society that did nothing with it's potentially brilliant premise .  here's another one .  it could be a brilliant satire on how teenagers need to go through teen angst in order to find themselves .  it's a stage , and this film does in fact realize that .  it gets its message across and it does it effortlessly .  now it just needs to work as a film .  which it doesn't .  it's too sloppy and too contrived .  it paints a bleak portrait of high school life . . . then  lets it lie .  it brings us a bunch of scary monsters who are all a bunch of disgustingly icky kiss-ups who do food drives and hang out at a 50s diner drinking milk shakes . . . then  gives it a cheap twist : when they get horny , they become homicidal .  isn't it scary enough that they're like this , and can't the real terror in the town be that you could be next to be just like them - not that you could be next to die ?  the film introduces us two three different characters who , in the beginning , are considered outsiders because they're not ( yet ) part of this clique : the new kid , steve ( james marsden - dull dull dull dull ) , who's having trouble at home because he hasn't gotten over his brother's ( ethan embry , in quick flashes so you don't recognize him - i did ) suicide ; the renegade girl , rachel ( katie holmes , from "" dawson's creek "" ) , who's chief personality trait is her prominent nose ring ; and by far the most interesting kid , gavin ( nick stahl , the kid from "" the man without a face "" ) , who's the most interesting because he's the only character who's given some dimension .  in the film's best scene , he introduces steve to every single clique , nailing each one's fetishes and hang-ups , and it's the best scene in the movie because it's witty , satirical , and interesting - something the rest of this film isn't .  gavin suspects there's something awry with the preppie kids , known as the blue ribbons , and in the tradition of all conspirators , and even when he actually shows hard pure evidence to steve , he's only treated as a typical raving conspiracy buff .  here , we have another case of "" the idiot plot , "" where not only could steve had done something about gavin and what happens to him , but he may have saved this film from being the dreary , dull film that it is without gavin , who gives it life and humor .  the only other half-interesting character is the school janitor , played by william sadler as a retarded , scary guy who may not be what he seems to be . . . but  really , we don't care anyway .  i probably shouldn't mention that this was directed by david nutter , who's works for "" the x-files , "" because that would probably tarnish his reputation .  like the show , he's good at setting up weird conspiracies , and creating a general creepy feel .  most of this film is shot at night and with dark eerie shadows for the maximum creepy effect , and some of it works .  but what this film is not so good at is coming out with a good payoff .  he keeps too much inside , so much that when the characters journey to a mental institution in the third act , you wonder why they just don't get the hell out of there .  i think what happens to gavin is proof enough that there's something rotten in the state of teen angstdom .  what this film needs to be is a lot longer , a lot more colorful , and a lot creepier .  if the best villain they can come up with is a guidance counselor ( played by bruce greenwood , an atom egoyan regular obviously just trying to pay the rent ) who still thinks he can get away with it even when most is revealed , then they need to come up with a tougher , smarter villain .  if he's so villainous , then why could two dense teenagers who couldn't figure out there was something going on until it was way too late find information on him in a couple minutes ?  the film , which runs about 80 or so minutes , just needs to work on these things , and become a lot less sloppy .  at such a short running time and with such lame , boring characters as these , it's pretty much obvious that leaving this film leaves a horribly unsatisfied taste in one's mouth , especially mine .

0|"in the interest of being generous , i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black .  sir anthony hopkins , playing a super-rich media mogul , has gathered his family around him for dinner .  his oldest daughter ( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing ) , who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party , presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes , which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake .  the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes .  hopkins , frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair , does what any man in his position would do : he punts .  whichever one you like , dear , he says .  and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do : she cries .  i liked that scene for two reasons .  first , the cakes looked really cool .  second , it was , perhaps , the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act .  meet joe black is chock-full of odd performances , people doing things for no discernible reason at all , and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot .  it's easy to watch meet joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani , but it's even easier to sleep right through it ( two people on my row managed it quite nicely ) .  the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess .  i know my audience had problems with the movie , because they thought it was a comedy .  case in point : everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie .  however , the first we see of him is as a young lawyer in a coffee shop hitting on the glamorous claire forlani .   ( it's not clear from the movie whether you need a law degree to become the angel of death , but it makes a certain kind of sense . )  it shouldn't take long for the observant moviegoer to realize that bad things are about to happen to mr . pitt .  and indeed they do ( after a hideously prolonged sequence where pitt looks over his shoulder at the retreating forlani and forlani looks over her shoulder at the retreating pitt ) , because pitt walks into the road without looking and suddenly gets squished .  well , when that happened , the audience howled with laughter , and continued to laugh at every comment that was remotely humorous .  so , if you think that sudden violent death and sarcastic drawing-room humor are funny , i encourage you to go see meet joe black immediately .  anyway , the deceased lawyer's body , no worse the wear from its massive injuries , is possessed by the angel of death and brad pitt takes over that role .  the idea is that death ( given the pen name of joe black , so as not to disturb others ) wants to take a holiday and experience the world .  if this weren't hollywood , we might get an interesting metaphysical discussion of life and death , but since it is , we get scene after scene of fish-out-of-water humor , just as if death is george of the jungle or crocodile dundee or some other poor schmuck who's wandered in from the jungle or the outback or whatever and doesn't know how to act in our society .  it also doesn't help that the character of death is written so inconsistently .  he claims to be on vacation , but he never does anything except hang around the seriously attractive claire forlani ( just try to get your travel agent to book that one ) .  he speaks very slow and halting english but perfectly fluent jamaican patois .  he knows everything about some characters , nothing about others .  and as played by brad pitt , he's not especially menacing or charming or glamorous or intriguing , he's just there .  it's as if someone told pitt , "" never mind about acting in this picture , son , just stand there and look pretty . ""  it's as if pitt is doing his keanu reeves impression throughout the movie .  i've used the phrase "" angel of death "" in this review very deliberately to contrast pitt's performance with this year's best angel performance , nicolas cage's in city of angels .  where pitt is cold and unfeeling , cage is as warm and empathetic as the situation allows .  where cage is genuinely curious about the nature of man , pitt is aloof and arrogant .  cage struck instant chemical sparks with co-star meg ryan , where the chemistry between pitt and forlani is only understandable if you accept the notion that forlani's character is so shallow that she can't see beyond pitt's good looks .  the movie's other top name is a much better actor , but that doesn't save meet joe black .  sir anthony hopkins isn't given much better material to work with , unfortunately .  he plays one of these good-hearted multimillionaire media moguls that only exist in hollywood .   ( one wonders what might have happened if they had made hopkins's character more realistically evil . )  hopkins is marked for death due to a bad ticker , but death steps in and grants him some extra time in exchange for being his guide in the world .  of course , no one can be sure of how they will act when death taps on their shoulder .  but i have to wonder ( and in this movie , you have a very long time to wonder ) how you or i would act in a similar situation , especially if you or i were a multimillionaire .  hopkins pretty much goes to the office -- and the major subplot revolves around who will control the corporation .  fans of corporate intrigue will be fascinated , i'm sure .  i stayed awake all the way through meet joe black , and i'm asking myself why .  movies about death should encourage you to live life to the fullest , which is what i'm going to do now .  go spend time with your family , go volunteer for a local charity , heck , go take a nap .  don't go see meet joe black , because all it will do is move you three long hours closer to death .  -- curtis edmonds   "" no children have ever meddled with the republican party and lived to tell about it .

"" while they're still getting to point b , or getting up with the rest of the audience after the big explosion which signals that nothing else of any consequence is going to happen .

0|can a horror movie truly be called a horror movie if it has no scares , suspense , or even eerie elements ?  i think not , but that's what children of the corn 666 : issac's return wants us to believe .  the sixth installment in the horrible , worn out series is by far the worst to date .  unlike the other five chapters , children of the corn 666 is a confusing , brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror , but either way , none of these movies are the least bit scary .  the film follows hannah ( natalie ramsey ) a teen looking for her mother in gatlin , nebraska , on the eve of her 21st birthday .  what starts out as a daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn , who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder .  that's about all that's understandable in the film , as after we learn this much , issac ( john franklin ) who led the children of the corn in a previous chapter , now an older , strange man , is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy .  and this is supposed to make sense .  really .  from the start the film is unclear of where its going , not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table , constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality , and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film .  the film runs at a short 78 minutes , but it seems to be more in the vicinity of two hours , as the bleak , slow pacing makes children of the corn 666 : issac's return excruciatingly boring .  plot holes are everywhere in tim sulka and john franklin's unbelievably horrible script , as nothing is accomplished or clear when the film reaches its conclusion .  everyone and everything involved with children of the corn 666 : issac's return , namely writers john franklin and tim sulka , along with director kari skogland , should crawl under a rock , and hope no one sees their horrible work of trash .  the bottom line : horrible , horrible , horrible .  another attempt to revive this worn out genre falls flat .  and what's with that title ?  the devil has nothing to do whatsoever with this film .  let's pray that this is the finale in one of the worst current film series .  one of the worst horror films in years .  |-0.9|0.9|0.9|"The explanations consistently express a highly negative sentiment towards the horror movie ""Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return,"" criticizing its lack of scares, suspense, eerie elements, confusing plot, slow pacing, lack of character development, numerous plot holes, script, and misleading title."
0|arnold schwarzenegger has been an icon for action enthusiasts , since the late 80's , but lately his films have been very sloppy and the one-liners are getting worse .  it's hard seeing arnold as mr . freeze in batman and robin , especially when he says tons of ice jokes , but hey he got 15 million , what's it matter to him ?  once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster , that can't compare with the likes of the terminator series , true lies and even eraser .  in this so called dark thriller , the devil ( gabriel byrne ) has come upon earth , to impregnate a woman ( robin tunney ) which happens every 1000 years , and basically destroy the world , but apparently god has chosen one man , and that one man is jericho cane ( arnold himself ) .  with the help of a trusty sidekick ( kevin pollack ) , they will stop at nothing to let the devil take over the world !  parts of this are actually so absurd , that they would fit right in with dogma .  yes , the film is that weak , but it's better than the other blockbuster right now ( sleepy hollow ) , but it makes the world is not enough look like a 4 star film .  anyway , this definitely doesn't seem like an arnold movie .  it just wasn't the type of film you can see him doing .  sure he gave us a few chuckles with his well known one-liners , but he seemed confused as to where his character and the film was going .  it's understandable , especially when the ending had to be changed according to some sources .  aside form that , he still walked through it , much like he has in the past few films .  i'm sorry to say this arnold but maybe these are the end of your action days .  speaking of action , where was it in this film ?  there was hardly any explosions or fights .  the devil made a few places explode , but arnold wasn't kicking some devil butt .  the ending was changed to make it more spiritual , which undoubtedly ruined the film .  i was at least hoping for a cool ending if nothing else occurred , but once again i was let down .  i also don't know why the film took so long and cost so much .  there was really no super affects at all , unless you consider an invisible devil , who was in it for 5 minutes tops , worth the overpriced budget .  the budget should have gone into a better script , where at least audiences could be somewhat entertained instead of facing boredom .  it's pitiful to see how scripts like these get bought and made into a movie .  do they even read these things anymore ?  it sure doesn't seem like it .  thankfully gabriel's performance gave some light to this poor film .  when he walks down the street searching for robin tunney , you can't help but feel that he looked like a devil .  the guy is creepy looking anyway !  when it's all over , you're just glad it's the end of the movie .  don't bother to see this , if you're expecting a solid action flick , because it's neither solid nor does it have action .  it's just another movie that we are suckered in to seeing , due to a strategic marketing campaign .  save your money and see the world is not enough for an entertaining experience .  |-0.8066666666666666|0.9233333333333333|0.85|The explanations reveal a consensus of negative sentiment towards Arnold Schwarzenegger's recent films, citing criticisms such as sloppy filmmaking, weak plot, lack of action, disappointment with the ending, and a decline in quality compared to his earlier successful movies like the Terminator series and True Lies.

0|"i still can't figure out why people went in droves to see this movie .  now before you go assuming i'm some sort of high brow snob , who can't appreciate a little dumb humor , let me say that i love cheap humor .  i thought there's something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998 .  low brow adolescent humor can be a lot of fun , the problem with the waterboy is that it is just low brow and adolescent , there is no humor component .  i wanted to like the waterboy , i really did .  i think i only laughed maybe 2 or 3 times throughout the entire movie .  actually , i smiled a couple of more times on top of that .  not a great record for a 90-minute film .  the problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies .  those responsible for this mess seem to think that the sheer fact that sandler walks around using a goofy voice and playing dumb the entire movie is a substitute for actual funny material .  nothing could be further from the truth , as matter of fact , sandler's idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film .  it's really a shame too , because this film had the potential to be very funny .  i personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian , it's just that so far he hasn't been able to find the right film to showcase his talents .  if his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons , my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live .  most of whom are now happily no longer in the entertainment industry .  sandler plays a 31-year-old , somewhat mentally challenged , waterboy for a college football team .  the team's somewhat mentally disturbed coach ( henry winkler ) realizes that his waterboy has a great deal of pent-up rage , which , if harnessed properly , would make him a force to be reckoned with on the football field .  you can figure out the rest from here .  sandler joins the team and this once lowly waterboy becomes a football star .  as i said , the film had a great deal of potential .  the idea was a decent one , but the main potential of this movie is a result of the cast .  all of whom are very good , just hamstrung by really , really , lousy material .  even sandler , annoying goofy voice and all , has enough charisma and natural comedic ability to overcome some of his bad material .  even as unfunny as his character is , i still found myself rooting for him throughout the film .  but it is the supporting cast that i feel most badly about .  if their material had been just a bit better , this film could have been such a funny movie .  fairuza balk plays sandler's leather-wearing biker-chick love interest and does a great job playing sleazy and sexy at the same time .  winkler is great as the coach who uses a "" coaching for dummies "" -style book to help him get through games .  the real standout though , is kathy bates .  even with some of the worst material of her career to deal with , she is still a treat to watch in her role as sandler's overprotective and overbearing mama .  even with the performances of bates and winkler , there is absolutely no way i would recommend this movie .  although i get the distinct impression that without them , this film would have ranked in negative numbers for me .  which is sad , because i can't really put my finger on a particular element of the movie and single it out as the cause of the disaster that it became .  it's obvious that those involved , specifically the actors , tried very hard to make what they thought was going to be a funny movie .  it's just too bad that 99 percent of all of the jokes fell flat .

0|gordie boggs ( arquette , aptly cast as a moron , as he is one ) and his best friend sean dawkins ( scott caan .  the son of james caan should not be reduced to garbage like this ! ) are two losers from wyoming with no jobs and no girlfriends , who look up to world championship wrestling champion jimmy king ( a terribly casted oliver platt ) , as he is everything they are not .  they finally get to see him live and he is screwed out of his title by the evil , ruthless promoter titus sinclair ( a wasted palitaliano , in a role originally meant for real-life wcw president eric bischoff , whose name was written all over the role ! ) .  gordie and sean track down king in atlanta and discover that he is not really the english king the wcw writers created for him , but a drunken , ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these two lunkheads as bob newhart was by larry , darryl , and darryl .  they sneak him back onto wcw tv , after which sinclair agrees to book him in a steel cage match in las vegas at wcw's next pay-per-view , against his rival , diamond dallas page .  if he wins , king gets his title and his career back , plus one million dollars .  wcw president eric bischoff , knowing his promotion was desperate with bad writing and ratings skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior world wrestling federation , came up with the idea for this movie hoping it would save wcw .  he was then fired and rehired two months ago , but by the time he'd left , they had already been contracted to do the film , and bischoff could not play sinclair ( which , in itself , is for the best , as anybody who has seen him on wcw programming knows that bischoff is no actor ! ) .  the characters of gordie and sean show you exactly what eric bischoff thinks of his fans .  he thinks of them as young , dumb pathetic idiots who will believe anything that will be put out in front of them is real .  that is why he doesn't take the fans into consideration when he books a nitro or a pay-per-view .  i have news for you , eric : no wrestling fan in this day and age is dumb enough to believe that professional wrestling isn't for show , unless they are four years old .  this is 2000 , you know , not 1985 .  bischoff will try to cover up criticism like that by saying it is a comedy , but i have no doubt in my mind that if this had been a dramatic , rocky-style film ( which it probably should have been .  professional wrestling is ridiculed enough as it is , why should the first wrestling movie in ten years be a comedy ? ) , gordie and sean would have been portrayed in the same light .  anybody who has seen the documentary wrestling with shadows , documenting wwf owner vince mcmahon's double-crossing of bret hart , will probably realize via the reviews and previews of ready to rumble , that it is basically a rip-off of that film's storyline with the poor man's wayne and garth thrown in for comedic affect .  you can tell titus sinclair is supposed to poke fun at vince , but any self-respecting wrestling fan knows that sinclair is more inspired by bischoff than vince , and that vince did what he had to do to bret hart .  all of these aspects of the film , needless to say , seriously offended me as a wrestling fan .  another thing i found disturbing about the film was the romance between gordie and nitro girl sasha ( the lovely rose mcgowan ) .  wouldn't it have been easier to bring something new into the relationship rather than revealing she was only working on gordie at sinclair's insistance ?  i hate that cliche !  the world wrestling federation would have made a better film .  they are the promotion everyone cares about , they are winning the ratings , they have better wrestlers , and they take their fans into consideration and don't treat fans like morons .  so , vince , how about a movie ?  |-0.4403333333333334|0.7833333333333333|0.6|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is negative, with criticism of the characters, storyline, and portrayal of wrestling in the movie ""Ready to Rumble"" compared unfavorably to the World Wrestling Federation."

0|"capsule : this super-light situation comedy from sweden tells the story of two close friends with romantic problems .  the script involves formerly taboo subjects like erotic toys and sexual enhancers but otherwise the writing is not a lot different from what is shown free on television .  the characters are paper-thin and the interesting ideas purely non-existent .  this is a decrement-life-by-90-minutes card .   , 0 ( -4 to +4 )  jalla ! jalla !  is basically an exuberant tv situation comedy written instead for the wide screen .  it tells the story of two park custodians and the problems they are finding on the path to true love .  the film is set in sweden where roro and mans ( fares fares and torkel petersson ) are custodians at a public park . roro is from a tightly knit lebanese family who control him very closely , mans is a swede from a much more liberal background .  they spend most of the day in the bushes at their park , cleaning up after dogs .  roro and mans each have girlfriends , but each has a problem .  roro ( nicknamed "" jalla "" ) is having family problems .  it seems that his family wants to arrange a marriage between him and a nice lebanese woman , yasmin ( laleh pourkarim ) , but he is already in love with lisa ( tuva novotny ) .  yasmin likes roro , but does not want to get married either .  mans on the other hand has been having a problem of sexual impotence .  the two friends worry about their problems and discuss the problems with each other .  mans thinks the answer to his problem is to purchase sexual enhancers .  the one catch is that he is too shy to go in and buy them .  roro and yasmin decide to give themselves some time by telling the families that they want to marry each other , but then plan to break up before the wedding .  not too surprisingly neither finds that his idea works out the way he quite expected .  the plot turns in several places are contrived .  one knows fairly quickly that if things are going to work our happily for everybody certain plot contrivances have to happen .  lebanese-born josef fares who wrote and directed is perhaps a better director than he is a writer .  when things start to get slow , he just adds throws in another story .  for example halfway into the film mans innocently antagonizes some local toughs and a long chase is added to the film .  characterization is a little better with roro than it is with mans who does not seem to have a whole lot more personality beyond fear for losing a biological function .  we do see some of roro's family life and his concerns .  that may be because roro's background is a lot like that of the director .  while the story was entertaining , i did not feel that i got anything worthwhile from the film .  it was just a way to pass about an hour and a half in my life .  one does not have to go to the movies to see entertainment like this .  i rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .

0|"confucius once said , "" governing a nation is like cooking a small fish -- don't overdo it . ""  his maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script , for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make .  granted , mike judge , writer-director of the workplace satire office space isn't exactly an amateur ( his most infamous work , the mtv series "" beavis and butt-head "" was pure gold for its network ) .  but unfailingly , judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground .  the iffiness in judge's plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal .  in fact , based on the popularity of scott adams' cartoon "" dilbert , "" which will soon have its own television series , a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood .  unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit-length sequences which would be more at home on the set of "" saturday night live "" rather than a full-length feature .  the most convincing evidence of this are the trailers for office space , which feature almost all of the movie's top content ; this leaves the actual picture appearing very deflated .  other evidence of office space's failure to work are its lack of good jokes .  the comedy is marginally funny at best , but not enough to get a packed house of theater-goers to laugh out loud .  the material in the movie is on-key for an older demographic than judge is used to targeting , and this could partially explain his work here .  however , the movie is loaded with too many misfires -- including the token plot -- to allow for any excuse .  the plot centers around three or four cubicled engineers , headed up by peter gibbons ( ron livingston ) , at a company named initech .  after the movie elaborately establishes the miserable working conditions at initech , the movie introduces us to two consultants ( john c . mcginley and paul willson ) which are in charge of "" downsizing "" the company's payroll .  when peter and his gang learns of this , as well as the reason behind it -- so their smooth talking boss bill lumbergh ( gary cole ) 's stock will go up -- they set about creating a plan to see his downfall .  the circumstances that follow were obviously intended to be hilarious but they come out as anything but .  a sympathetic cast and a muddled jennifer aniston-as-love-interest subplot are all that keep this one together , but it's definitely missable in lieu of something more intelligent .

0|"it seemed like the perfect concept .  what better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ?  it's exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh .  jim carrey's signed on too ?  even better .  the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as "" schizophrenia , "" and so forth .  such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers' fire , proving that some people just couldn't take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy .  yes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn't funny .  it's not for lack of trying .  the farrellys utilize in "" me , myself & irene "" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them .  this , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult .  soon enough , charlie's repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster .  this guy isn't above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he's been insulted , or holding a little girl's head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street .  then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks .  some have suggested that this isn't a problem , because the farrelly brothers' brand of humor doesn't require plot to work .  they're wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys' last effort , 1996's "" there's something about mary . ""   ( 1999's "" outside providence "" was technically an earlier project . )  the brothers' earlier film wasn't funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected .  in "" mary , "" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they'd have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion .   "" me , myself & irene , "" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at "" mary "" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work .  having been produced by the same guys who made "" mary , "" "" irene "" seems like an even bigger disappointment .  the brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes .  but they haven't come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of "" me , myself & irene "" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy .  the plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who's in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that's entirely predictable from the get-go .   ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ?  yeah , me too . )  the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven't already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be .  compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it's no longer funny , merely gross .  the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry .  take , for example , the subplot involving charlie's three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) .  the incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face .  but by the end of the film , they're still doing the same schitck ; it hasn't been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn't been dropped either .  that's too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through .   "" me , myself & irene "" reeks of wasted opportunities .  there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie's new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank's actions .  this doesn't really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie's condition early on , so they don't have any opportunity to be surprised by it .  the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , "" whitey "" ) , but the script doesn't go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax .  jim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he's left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in "" all of me . ""  it's a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny .  carrey doesn't pull any stunts we don't expect him to pull , and the farrellys' script doesn't give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren't set up in any meaningful way .  perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better .  zellweger's irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in "" mary "" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed .  irene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she's ditzy , clever , or neither .  as such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only "" sane "" person in the film .  chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this .  he , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected .  after viewing the shapeless mess that "" me , myself & irene "" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves .  maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked .  but i don't believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style .  if the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they'll rebound just fine .  even after that happens , though , i'll still consider "" me , myself & irene "" to be a high-caliber misfire .

0|it's been hours since i returned from the much anticipated sci-fi opus `mission to mars' , and i can still detect the reek of moldy cheddar .  why ?  the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy , stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera , instead shooting for the angle of a feel-good science fiction drama more akin to `2001 : a space odyssey' .  i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie-going patrons were expecting another `armageddon' .  but no , `mission to mars' certainly isn't one large action sequence about colossal disaster .  this is a supposedly thoughtful , family-friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel .  you have been warned .  of course , crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible ( see `apollo 13' for an excellent example ) , but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation .  brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off .  when he gets his hands on an intelligent , systematically practical script like `the untouchables' or `mission : impossible' , the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement ( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally ) .  of course , there's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name ( including `snake eyes' and the notorious bomb `the bonfire of the vanities' ) . . . .  all of which makes me want to call de palma the most talented hack in hollywood .  that term may be too harsh , but if i were judging him solely on the perpetual waste of talent that is `mission to mars' , my choice of words would have been slightly less lenient .  if i were gary sinise , i wouldn't touch de palma with a 10-foot pole .  sinise is a wonderful , wonderful actor , but after appearing in `snake eyes' and this vomit-inducing sham , i'm sure he wouldn't want to risk the embarrassment of a third collaboration .  the academy award-winner plays nasa astronaut jim mcconnell , a man who recently lost his wife ( kim delaney ) and is apparently psychologically unfit for an upcoming space shuttle mission to mars ( oops , forgot to mention the year - 2020 ) .  after a barbecue get-together for the astronauts , we cut to luc goddard ( don cheadle ) and his team , who are already taking measurements and calculations on the red planet .  suddenly , a towering formation of rocks and soil - probably best dubbed a `sand tornado' - appears and creates a whirlwind of suction .  for some reason , the astronauts just stand there calmly to admire this , as if it were a lovely piece of art .  the team is killed within seconds , expect for luc , who was able to send one final transmission and may still be alive .  immediately , a second mission - consisting of astronauts mcconnell , husband and wife woody and terri blake ( tim robbins and connie nielsen ) and phil ohlmyer ( jerry o'connell ) - are dispatched to rescue luc and discover the mysterious secret of planet mars .  let's put the `secret' on hold for now , and discuss the trip there .  it is explained , whether scientifically accurate or not ( probably not ) , that a trip to mars takes roughly six months .  i'm not sure why the quartet of screenwriters behind `m2m' didn't capitalize on this juicy opportunity of creating tension and claustrophobia .  instead , we join the team during their final days aboard the ship .  what happened during the five months prior to this ?  did they just play cards and tell dirty jokes ?  still , there are few nicely tense moments ( maybe the only in the movie ) during the time-frame involving a fuel leak .  depalma's direction is quite good in these scenes , although the score by ennio morricone is largely inconsistent ( organ music in space ?  c'mon ) .  there's a few good , imaginative ideas in the landslide of cheese , a sad realization that causes me to sigh out loud .  it's a colossal bummer that `mission to mars' is poorly assembled and laughably written , with a dubious and supremely silly finale that will only satisfy dedicated optimists .  as mentioned before , anyone looking for some disaster-movie carnage is going to feel savagely disappointed . . .  maybe even cheated .  after the unbelievably hokey final shot ( with the words ? the end' somehow adding insult to injury ) , a few audience members made the effort to boo and hiss at the screen .  others muttered obscenities , shaking their heads in disbelief while mumbling `jeez , that sucked . '  okay , it did suck .  but you have to show the actors some sympathetic mercy . . .  after all , they do pretty well .  sinise is sincere and effective in many of his scenes , robbins and nielsen wholeheartedly convince as a loving nasa couple , and funnyman o'connell - well , he has a couple lines are actually amusing ( and intentionally so ) .  the digital effects accompanying the sand tornado sequence are quite impressive .  so , by golly , where did this `mission' go wrong ?  looking back on the appalling experience , i would say in practically every conduit and crevasse it could have .  while watching `mission to mars' , my suggestion would be to immediately abort , or better yet , don't even strap yourself in for lift-off .  |-0.8000000000000002|0.9|0.8666666666666667|"The overall sentiment towards the movie ""Mission to Mars"" is highly negative, with criticisms of its shoddy screenplay, lack of excitement, and laughably written finale, leading to disappointment and dissatisfaction among viewers."
0|"despite its exceedingly well-done visual effects , 1995's original species was one big hunk of sci-fi cheese , from the writing to the feeble performances .  so , coming from such b-grade roots , its sequel's stunning ineptitude is not terribly surprising , yet at the same time it is .  it would not have been difficult at all for the people behind species ii to top the hokey original , yet they have somehow managed to fabricate something just as bad , if not even worse .  something is clearly amiss when the back door left open for a sequel in species--a sewer rat becomes not quite of this earth after eating a body part from the exploded alien/human hybrid sil--is never entered into ( perhaps that was left for species iii--though i'm not giving away anything when i say that this installment has an open back door of its own ) .  the alien fun and games begin this time when a three-person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain , patrick ross ( justin lazard , late of cbs's short-lived soap of a few years back , central park west/cpw ) .  this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film's sil , but it's close enough , and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy , engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find .  meanwhile , scientist dr . laura baker ( the returning marg helgenberger ) has created a clone of sil named eve ( natasha henstridge again ) for research purposes .  it doesn't take long for eve to sense another alien presence , which send her libido into hyperdrive .  it's up to laura and her former partner , bounty hunter press lennox ( michael madsen , another returnee ) ; and patrick's uninfected shipmate dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) to find patrick before the in-heat eve does .   "" this isn't the x-files , goddammit ! ""  exclaims one character in the early going .  in terms of quality , he's absolutely right , but he's also wrong .  the new alien first appears as an otherworldly oozing sludge that causes patrick's pupils to dilate once he's infected .  looks and sounds an awful lot like the x-files's "" black cancer "" to me .  but that's not the only source director peter medak and writer chris brancato steal from .  species was already a ripoff of alien , but medak makes the cribbing much more blatant than the original's director , roger donaldson , did .  human patrick is given a tongue that also has a tongue within itself , and his alien form more closely resembles the alien than eve's alien body ( which ironically was designed by alien designer h . r . giger ) .  a large alien hive that our heros douse with a substance fired from large guns ?  aliens sans flamethrowers .  the visual effects were by far the best thing about species , and the sequel's effects crew at steve johnson's xfx inc . keeps that high-quality tradition alive ; no cheap-looking lost in space cgi here .  after the effects , the original's best asset was the fresh presence of henstridge .  however , medak and brancato have no idea what exactly to do with her for this installment .  at one point she's called on to play alien "" empath "" ? la forest whitaker in the original , but for most of the duration she's holed up in a glass cell .  by the time the big breakout so prominently featured in the trailer actually takes place , the film is well into its home stretch .  so the rest of the time we are treated to patrick , played with little zest by lazard .  one problem with the first film was that the deadly , horny , but innocent-at-heart sil was too sympathetic ; no such problem with patrick , who comes off as a cocky pretty boy before the alien takes control .  the rest of the cast also fails to add much , but the writing can be faulted for that .  helgenberger and madsen go through the motions , but they are already hampered by the clich ? d development that somewhere between the two films , the once-linked laura and press stopped getting along .  williamson suffers the worst indignity .  he tries his best to enliven the token african-american role , but how can anyone recite insulting , derivative lines such as "" i'm gonna get african on someone's ass "" and not appear ridiculous ?  but species ii's worst crime is being a thoroughly uninteresting piece of work .  at least the original featured plenty to laugh at--unaccountably awful performances by the otherwise fine actors ben kingsley and whitaker , and the sight of helgenberger's character performing fellatio on madsen's , for a start .  but the filmmakers do not display any discernable effort at all , let alone the misguided effort that is required for something to reach the camp level .  for all the blood and gore , nudity , and sex thrown in , species ii is , quite simply , a vapid bore .

0|"the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury's love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon .  as always , jacobi's acting is impeccable , but the movie tries hard and succeeds at being unentertaining and opaque .  the movie convincingly argues that francis , played by jacobi , was a completely despicable and vain individual , but it never provides any insight into his work or any motivation for his attitude .  when interviewed by a fawning talk show host , francis calls his style "" chance brushstrokes . ""  starting with a burglary of francis's flat , the film uses loud sound effects that sound like they were lifted from a cheap horror movie .  the camera shots are heavy on the avant-garde angles -- lots of wide-angle close-ups and distorted shots filmed through colored-glass reflections .  the director is much more interested in filmmaking style than in the substance of the story with the result being a sterile examination of a lonely and vain man .  daniel craig , in a lifeless performance , plays the burglar and boxer , george dyer .  when francis lays eyes on him after the break-in , francis promises not to call the police if he'll stay for sex .  he stays for the entire movie but never respects the man with whom he shares a bed .  he thinks that francis's paintings have "" no bloody use , "" and the movie presents no counterargument .  writer maybury barely outlines francis's character , and george and the rest of the supporting cast remain a complete enigma .  we learn little of george other than francis's reason for liking him -- george's "" amorality and innocence . ""  francis's love of sadomasochism is shown early and often .   "" boxing is such a marvelous aperitif for sex , "" he reflects to george on the way to watch a boxing match .  as the fighter's head is sliced open with a heavy blow , the camera cuts to a gleeful francis whose own head is soaked by the flying blood .  francis appears to be in complete ecstasy .  another of francis's favorite activities is viewing old movies of atrocities .  as the carnage mounts , we witness an orgasmically happy francis in the audience .  in a film that tries obsessively to shock , one dream sequence portrays a family in a car accident .  francis's mind slowly examines every bloody limb of the mother , the father , and the boy .  sometimes the script throws us tidbits of francis's wisdom which illuminate little while merely sounding insightful .   ( "" i'm optimistic by nature .  i'm optimistic about nothing . ""   "" loneliness is my only true companion . "" )  we learn more details about francis's makeup techniques than about the man himself .  he prefers shoe polish for his hair and sink cleaning powder for his teeth .  full of metaphorical interpretations , the film's best scene occurs late one night when george has to get up to go to the bathroom .  mistaking francis's picture of a toilet for the genuine article , he urinates on it and then crawls back into bed contentedly .  like a parody of a bad art house movie , love is the devil has horrid characters filmed bizarrely and confusingly by a director who is much more interested in technique than storytelling .  by the end , the audience hasn't learned any more than it could have in a three-minute sketch .  love is the devil runs 1 : 30 .  the film is not rated but should be considered nc-17 for violence , profanity , graphic sex , nudity and sadomasochism and is unacceptable for most teenagers .

0|" "" payback , "" brian helgeland's inauspicious directing debut ( coincidentally , he previously penned the award-winning screenplay for 1997's "" l . a . confidential "" ) , is a wildly uneven and thoroughly unpleasant revenge thriller that takes one idea---a movie with non-stop violence , death , and villains---and runs with it , or should i say , barely manages to crawl away with it .  mel gibson , in yet another disappointing picture ( "" conspiracy theory "" and "" lethal weapon 4 , "" anyone ? ) , stars as the reprehensible villain/hero , porter , a man who becomes determined to get his 50% share of $140 , 000 , which he stole in a robbery , back when his partner-in-crime ( gregg henry ) and drug-addicted wife ( deborah kara unger ) double-cross him , shoot him , and leave him for dead .  porter is not dead , however---not by a long shot---as he quickly rehabilitates and , along with his loyal prositute girlfriend , rosie ( maria bello ) , sets out to make everyone involved in the scam pay .  the tagline for "" payback "" is , "" get ready to root for the bad guy , "" and sure enough , this is true , as pretty much every significant character who appears is crooked in some way .  i wouldn't have a problem with this offbeat detail if the painfully thin story had been of any interest , but it wasn't , and therefore , i found myself having an especially laborious time investing myself into a wide array of character that have absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever .  no attempt is made to flesh the roles into three-dimensional characters , and there are no vacant signs that anyone has any sort of humanity in them .  just because the protagonist , a "" bad guy , "" is played by mel gibson doesn't mean i will "" root for him , "" and i didn't .  quite the contrary , every person in the movie deserved to die a gory death ( although some of them did , anyway , just to spice up the dull proceedings ) .  since none of the respectable actors in "" payback "" actually have human beings to play , only one performance managed to stand out .  lucy alexis liu ( of t . v . 's "" ally mcbeal "" ) , who plays a spicy s&m dominatrix , brightens up every scene she is in , and has a definite flair for comedy , something i would have liked to have seen more of , since most of the humor fell with a resounding splat .  meanwhile , gibson , who is perfectly fine here , sleepwalks through a role that is not the least bit challenging .  unger , who made an impression in 1997's "" the game , "" is surprisingly wasted and it is difficult to see why she took such a part since she disappears ten minutes in , and only has two purproses : ( 1 ) to get high on heroin , and ( 2 ) because she plays a key part in an early flashback .  finally , kris kristofferson appears in a throwaway role during the climax , and this unnecessary plot development sticks out like a sore thumb ( tellingly , he didn't appear in the original cut of the film , but was cast when extensive reshoots took place months later ) .  like most action movies , the star often takes a licking but keeps on ticking .  in the course of the 102-minute running time of "" payback , "" porter is shot three times in the back , hit by a van , beaten up , and has his feet smashed with a sledgehammer .  and guess what ?  not only does he survive the whole ordeal , but he is happy-go-lucky in the penultimate sequence ( and can still walk ! ) ,  even though he looks like he had recently substituted for a punching bag .   "" payback "" is not , in any way , an entertaining film , even though i am sure the makers hoped it would be with all the graphic carnage that goes on , but take away that violence and what you are basically left with is a blank screen .  perhaps director helgeland would have been smart to consider this , so he could have at least added a few worthwhile elements , like a fresh storyline and characters whom you could even remotely stand to be around for a few hours .

""  the canines' lack of personality would be easier to take if the human beings had a little .  joely richardson and jeff daniels are stunningly bland in their lead roles .  in previous films , daniels successfully played off his white bread persona .  in "" something wild "" , he revealed the rebellious thrill-seeker beneath his neutral demeanor .  in "" terms of endearment "" , his hapless appearance masked a cold , manipulative womanizer .  here , he and richardson are so consistently bland that it's a wonder their images even stick to the film .  glenn close , however , has no problems establishing a distinct personality .  as the villainous icon cruella devil , she tears up the screen in a deliciously over-the-top performance .  close matches the intensity of the animated cruella by becoming a cartoon herself .  with a two-tone fright wig , red gloves with long nails attached to the fingertips , garish animal skin outfits and stiletto heels , close bursts through her scenes like a force of nature .  she's clearly having a ball playing this monstrous icon , and her wicked glee is infectious .  when she spits out lines like "" you've won the battle , but i'm about to win the wardrobe ! , ""  the film comes briefly to life .   "" 101 dalmatians "" is crammed with john hughes' typical heavy-handed approach to comedy .  after an ingenuous opening showing pongo's morning routine as he gets daniels prepared for the day , the film quickly tumbles into lame slapstick as the pooch drags daniels on a careening trek through a city park . a little slapstick goes a long way , but hughes just keeps laying it on .  the second half of the film , where local animals team up to rescue 99 nondescript dalmatian puppies from devil and her henchmen , is a tedious home alone clone , with the bad guys enduring a variety of sadistic assaults worthy of an itchy & scratchy cartoon , including a thug getting his testicles fried on an electric fence .   "" 101 dalmatians "" has cute puppies and a hoot of a performance from glenn close , but not enough to warrant enduring third rate slapstick , bland characters , and unconvincing animatronic raccoons high-fiving one another .  rent the cartoon !

0|" "" spawn "" may be somewhat of an older film .  in fact it will probably be on video before anyone who hasn't seen it will finally get to see it ( that is , if they see it ) .  but i managed to catch it before it made it's way out of theaters and into the world of rentals and , god forbid , video cassette purchasing .  it wasn't the worst film of year by any means .  it isn't even on the top 5 of the worst films of the year .  but it did manage to top the bottom five of the bottom ten , which , in simpler terms , means it comes in at number 6 on my "" worst of 1997 "" list .  the only reason it doesn't come in lower is thanks to the special effects , which might actually have been some of the best of the year .  performances , however , were either wooden or , for the most part , unforgivingly campy .  in fact , this film shows no signs of attempting to avoid campiness !  even the editing seemed to boast a campy quality .  i don't know how to explain that one ; it wasn't exactly choppy , but something about it seemed .   .   .  well , annoyingly unprofessional .  john leguizamo almost makes it as clown , but not quite .  he is the only character who provides the audience with any laughs that can honestly be called intentional .  but the main problem i found with "" spawn "" , as with most films that wind up on my "" worst of "" lists , is that it was just plain boring .  i wouldn't even say there was a climax to the film .  sure , it had the big battle scene at the end , but the only excitement felt was that the movie might be nearing a conclusion .  never too soon , the movie did conclude in a very simple , disappointing way .  even though it's one of the shorter movies i've seen this year , it's one that i would definitely not want to subject myself to sitting thru again .  like i said , the special effects are the only reason that this film should have any sense of pride , no matter how small .  i was impressed with the opening sequence , so long as i didn't allow the melodramatic voice-over and lobotomizing editing to get to me .  and batman has nothing on the spectacular visuals spawn's outfit created .  but even the effects got tiresome during the final scenes , which looked quite a bit like a modern video game .  who knows if "" spawn : the video game "" wasn't part of the plan from the beginning ?  keeping in mind that the film was based on a comic book makes it somewhat more approachable , and in a very small amount , makes up for the cheeziness of it all .  but none of this movie's saving graces can it make it something i'd recommend seeing , no matter what the price of admission .  this movie is definitely not for young children , which shouldn't really be a problem seeing as how only teenagers , if anyone , would likely find it appealing .  if you really want to catch a movie , there are many better ones out there , no matter what your tastes might be !  trust me !   "" spawn "" has very little to offer even the most avid moviegoers !

0|"from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play-by- play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli .  hc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we're joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who's here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors .  nice to see you , jim .  as a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ?  jb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago .  one entry was definitely enough , and i'm surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 . this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video .  it's worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature .  i should also mention that this movie likely won't play all that well in cleveland .  now that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks .  actually , most of the action involves the twins' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise .  hc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field .  leading off this inning is john warren .  he steps into the batter's box and takes kent's pitch low for ball one .  wh : so , the story's strictly minor league , right ?  what's it about ?  jb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell .  when twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to "" the show . ""  with the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track .  in fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley ) .  soon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus' overachieving group against huff's overpaid , last-place bunch .  wh : can we guess who wins ?  jb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you've already seen the box score .  on top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair .  they're not just boring ; they're lackluster .  but the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they've been about using baseball situations to generate laughs .  hc : warren fouls off a fastball .  1 and 1 .  wh : are there lots of yuks in this one ?  jb : not one , from start to finish .  i enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny .  okay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh .  the two sequels haven't just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low .  even bob uecker's once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they're the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing .  hc : here's the 1-1 pitch .  looooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball !  the count goes to 1 and 2 .  wh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ?  jb : yes .  there aren't any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural .  but i'd gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor .  heck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors .  wh : it's nice to see old friends one more time , isn't it ?  like cerrano , tanaka , and dorn .  jb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back .  there aren't any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs .  yeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can't throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ?  they have no depth .  notable absences include tom berenger's veteran and charlie sheen's "" wild thing . ""  we don't really miss them , though .  hc : breaking ball , low and outside .  2 and 2 .  wh : so you're saying that we should give this one a miss ?  jb : that's right .  to use baseball terminology , it's a three-pitch strikeout .  if you're looking for a good movie that involves baseball , try popping the natural , field of dreams , bull durham , or even the first major league into the vcr .  actually , this is an oddly-timed release , since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters .  even the minor league seasons are already underway .  don't bother with major league : back to the minors .  it's a wretched time- waster .  wh : thanks for the advice .  jb : you're welcome .  hc : and here's the 2-2 pitch .  fouled back , right into this booth .  hey , jim , heads up !  oops .  somebody better get him some ice for that .  he may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies , but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls .  odd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him , almost as if he has a grudge to settle .  anyway , back to the action on the field ?

0|"it's time to take cover .  after a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest .  in early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar .  of the two , i had heard that dante's peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video .  the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town .  the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption .  flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people .  we see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing .  it is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road .  symbolism doesn't get much more blatant than that .  we learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u . s . geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred .  harry survived , but his wife did not .  a few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante's peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine ) .  there harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop .  although the mayor doesn't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are .  they are afraid that harry's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante's peak .  they would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug .  however , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath .  thus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption .  this film contains a number of cliches .  the amorous couple is one .  as soon as they doff their clothes , you know they're going to die .  the town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog .  countless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable .  watching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well .  unfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible .  for example , harry's boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u . s . geological survey join harry to assess the situation .  paul basically tells the townsfolk that harry's eruption predictions aren't cause for alarm .  this causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work .  when paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , "" cause this town's in trouble and i'm the best man you've got . ""  even better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving .  he likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water .  if the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won't move and will allow itself to be cooked .   "" is that your recipe for frog soup ? ""  asks one of the team members .   "" it's my recipe for disaster , "" responds harry .  dante's peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious .  our heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid .  mayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , "" acid eats metal . ""  thanks for the tip .  when we first see the u . s . geological survey building , there's a caption labeling it as such .  this wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , "" u . s . geological survey . ""  i suppose the caption is for people who can't read signs .  although harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why .  there is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this .  when they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , "" why do they want to kiss ?  were they even attracted to each other ? ""  if i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn't even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act .  who does he think he is ?  james bond ?  the eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed .  there are several "" warning signs "" prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don't feel as if they are leading up to anything .  for example , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot .  a tremor occurs .  does he plunge headlong to his death ?  is he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below ?  no , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg .  the sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well .  it wasn't .  one plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante's peak .  in a disaster movie , there's usually one guy who's greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite , and usually gets killed by the disaster .  it's okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved .  if you're going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way .  in dante's peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they don't really try hard enough .  maybe the mayor's abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one .  for no apparent reason , she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt .  perhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate .  there are a couple of good things about this movie .  the first is the scenery .  there are panoramic shots of forests , lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful .  the second is the special effects .  they are the closest i've ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption .  but when elements which don't speak are going to be the best parts of your movie , you'd probably better rewrite the script .
