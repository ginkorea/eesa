""  alicia plays , well , the babysitter , who is taking care of some kids one night while the parents ( j . t .  walsh and lee garlington ) go out to a party .  the film , trying to be like one of those introspective erotic thrillers , shows every characters' thoughts , except alicia's .  the thing is alicia's in most of them in most cases , and the thoughts aren't too kosher .  first off , there's her boyfriend ( jeremy london , who gave one of the all-time lousy performances in "" mallrats , "" and is only a notch better here ) , who's a dorky kid who hangs out with a kind of bully , played by nicky katt from "" suburbia "" ( who shows he's got that quiet creepiness down pat once again ) .  they decide they want to crash her babysitting job , looking for the typical babysitting hanky-panky .  somethine like that .  the film intercuts between the subplots ( alicia babysitting , nicky and jeremy , the party ) and each characters' thoughts .  we get to see jeremy and nicky's dreams of doing a little threeway with alicia , j . t .  thinking of coming home to find alicia naked in the bathtub ( she has it all covered up , the little tease ) , and , worst of all , lee garlington dreaming of that hunk , george segal .  it even shows them in bed together .  yea .  i so wanted to see george and lee garlington in bed , though i guess i'm used to george after seeing her and mary tyler moore fooling around in "" flirting with disaster .

0|"star wars : ? episode i -- the phantom menace ( 1999 )  director : george lucas cast : liam neeson , ewan mcgregor , natalie portman , jake lloyd , ian mcdiarmid , samuel l . jackson , oliver ford davies , terence stamp , pernilla august , frank oz , ahmed best , kenny baker , anthony daniels screenplay : george lucas producers : rick mccallum runtime : 131 min .  us distribution : 20th century fox rated pg : mild violence , thematic elements  copyright 1999 nathaniel r . atcheson  a fellow critic once stated his belief that a reviewer should not speak of himself in his own review .  i've attempted to obey this rule in recent months , but to do so would be impossible in this case .  the fact is , nearly every person who goes to see the phantom menace brings baggage in with them .  the original star wars trilogy means so much to so many people .  for me , they calibrated my creativity as a child ; they are masterful , original works of art that mix moving stories with what were astonishing special effects at the time ( and they still hold up pretty darn well ) .  i am too young to have seen star wars in the theater during its original release , but that doesn't make me any less dedicated to it .  on the contrary , the star wars trilogy -- and the empire strikes back in particular -- are three items on a very short list of why i love movies .  when i heard that george lucas would be making the first trilogy in the nine-film series , i got exited .  when i first saw screenshots from the film , well over a year ago , i embarked on a year-long drool of anticipation .  and when the first previews were released last thanksgiving , i was ready to see the film .  but then there was the hype , the insane marketing campaign , and lucasfilm's secretive snobbery over the picture .  in the last weeks before the picture opened , while multitudes of fans waited outside of theaters and stood in the boiling sun days in advance just to be the first ones in the theater , i was tired of hearing about it .  i was tired of seeing cardboard cut-outs of the characters whenever i went to kfc or taco bell .  i just wanted to see the movie .  reader , do not misunderstand .  i did not have an anti-hype reaction .  the hype was unavoidable .  i understand and accept the hype -- it's just what happens when the prequel to the most widely beloved films of all time get released .  five minutes into the phantom menace , i knew there was a problem .   "" who are these jedi knights ? ""  i asked .   "" why are they churning out stale dialogue with machine-gun rapidity ? ""   "" why aren't these characters being developed before their adventures ? ""   "" why is there a special effects shot in nearly every frame of the entire film ? ""  these were just some of my questions early on .  later , i asked , "" where's the magic of the first three films ? ""  and "" why am i looking at my watch every fifteen minutes ? '  by the end of the film , i was tired , maddened , and depressed .  george lucas has funneled his own wonderful movies into a pointless , mindless , summer blockbuster .  the phantom menace is no star wars film .  take away the title and the jedi talk and the force , and you're left with what is easily one of the most vacuous special effects movies of all time .  it's an embarrassment .  i looked desperately for a scene in which a character is explored , or a new theme is examined , or a special effects shot isn't used .  there are a few of each , but they're all token attempts .  the fact is , george lucas has created what is simultaneously an abysmally bad excuse for a movie and a pretty good showcase for digital effects .  this is not what i wanted to see .  i didn't want to leave the phantom menace with a headache and a bitter taste in my mouth , but i did .  the story centers mostly around qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson , looking lost and confused ) and his apprentice , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor , who scarcely has a line in the film ) and their attempts to liberate the people of the planet naboo .  naboo is the victim of a bureaucratic war with the trade federation ; their contact on naboo is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , the teenage ruler who truly cares for her people .  after picking up jar jar binks ( a completely cgi character , voiced by ahmed best ) , they head to tatooine , where they meet young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his mother ( pernilla august ) .  qui-gon knows that the force is strong with young anakin , and so the jedi knights take the boy with them on their journeys .  the bad guys are darth maul and darth sidious , neither of whom have enough lines to register as characters .  there isn't anything particularly wrong with this story when looking at it in synopsis form .  the way lucas has handled it , however , it unsatisfactory .  first of all , we don't learn one single thing about qui-gon jinn .  not one thing .  what was his life like before this film ?  well , i imagine he didn't have one .  that's why he feels like a plot device .  this probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he's recently retired from film ( i don't blame him , honestly ) .  obi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting .  mcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere .  since these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie .  things start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role .  i was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting .  and when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving .  also fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written .  jar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i've ever had to endure , but he's more interesting than most of the humans .  as soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over , it's back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes .  i've seen many movies that qualify as "" special effects extravaganzas , "" but the phantom menace is the first one i've seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie .  the reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint .  i can't say that i didn't find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film .  but i also found the effects deadening and tiresome .  my breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away .  can't we have one stinking scene that isn't bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ?  i got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours .  and then there's the question of magic .  what was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ?  i have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel .  john williams' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas' direction .  i think it comes right down to characters : there are none here .  i longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing .  and what about the ridiculous expectations ?  mine weren't that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects .  instead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show .  i don't hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i'd like to forget that it exists , and yet i can't .  it's here to stay .  i can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they don't , then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series .

0|"the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic .  finding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius .  combining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of "" kramer vs .  kramer "" ) and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment .  in yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past few years ?  -- the atmosphere is moody , the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere .  over-70 harry ross ( paul newman ) is a washed up cop-turned-private eye-turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life .  he's screwed up things pretty well ( "" i had a wife and daughter .  now , i'm a drunk ) and is at a crossroads .  a couple of years ago , he traveled to mexico to bring back mel ( reese witherspoon ) , the under-age daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherine ( susan sarandon ) ames and now lives with them .  the ames are former movie stars , past their prime and the three have become fast friends .  one gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up .  to fill his time , he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine .  jack is in even worse shape than harry .  he's dying of cancer with only a year to live .  things do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him .  instead of the routine errand that ross expects , he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex-cop who is , himself , full of bloody holes .  this unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine's first husband 20 years before .  through a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel's mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross's former cop buddies , ex-lover and would-be sidekick , the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to .  it's a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale , but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about .  the only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario .  by the time they show you , it doesn't matter .  the storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross's relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) , a partner wannabe .  these scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief , however they are neither .  rubin and ross have some past relationship but either it's not explained or i didn't care enough at that point to remember .  a running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform .  it's also not funny , doesn't connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course .  on the positive side , it's often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen .  the three leads all have well-deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished , if not extraordinary jobs .  newman is a grand actor , but doesn't seem quite suited to the dark film style .  he is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out .  hackman , also low-key , is believable but lacks sparkle .  sarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one-dimensional .  the actors do what they can with lame dialog , but they can't pull the film out of the hole it's dug for itself .  james garner who plays ross's old buddy ex-cop raymond hope is always a treat , but even he half-heartedly struggles through lines like "" i'm glad they didn't shoot your pecker off . ""  the best part of the film is the look at old friends , how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make .  the genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen  the film doesn't run very long before the audience realizes that it's hopeless .  the only reason for watching is the actors .  it reminds me of disaster movies such as "" towering inferno "" where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film's problems .  in a better world , there would have been second-rate actors in this second-rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better .  of course , we don't live in that better world , but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie .

0|"martial arts master steven seagal ( not to mention director ! ) has built a career out of playing an allegedly fictitious martial arts superman who never gets hurt in fights , talks in a hushed tone , and squints at any sign of danger .  he's also the most consistent individual in hollywood today , since all his movies suck .  they basically represent his egotisitical tendencies about his art ( that is , martial art ) .  i'm sure the guy's good , and he seems like a nice guy on talk shows , although a tad haughty , but these movies he makes are all the same : a guy who is basically indestructable , is maybe wounded supposedly mortally , then comes back with a vengeance and goes buddha on all the baddies asses ( although i kinda liked "" under siege "" ) .  of course , this one , as a change , has a "" message "" that is drilled into our mind . . . of  course , after he blows up a lot of stuff and kills a bunch of people .  so why do i watch his crap ?  i usually don't .  i will never , and you can hold me to this , i will never pay to see this man's movies , unless , and only unless , he's in a supporting role ( i . e .   "" executive decision "" ) and i'd definitely pay if he dies ( i . e .   "" executive decision "" ) .  but this one has a special place in my heart .  this doesn't mean it's good or that i even liked it .  this was the last movie i watched with my deceased uncle , and we had one hell of a time ripping it apart a la "" mystery science theatre 3000 , "" and this was a couple years before i had heard of "" mystery science theatre 3000 . ""  in this one , seagal plays a worker for a mining factory set in alaska and run by the greased-up typical shallow villain , this time played by an oscar-winner to give the movie some more clout - michael caine .  it seems that caine wants to do something with his oil factory that includes him dumping oil all over inuit land .  around the 20-30 minute point , seagal speaks up to him in what seems to be the typical speech to all the vain entrepeneurs ( what with his new "" fire down below , "" another "" message film "" ) , and caine has him bumped off . . . or  does he ?  seagal is rescued by some inuits , and falls in love with one of them , played by joan chen , who can act , hypothetically , but , for some reason , not here .  one of caine's cliched henchmen ( played here with a lot of overacting by john c . mcginley ) shoots the cheif of the inuit clan , and chen and seagal go on a voyage to take down the oil factory . . . literally ,  of course .  at one point , seagal gives a wonderfully hysterical speech about how he doesn't have any options but blow stuff up .  he even goes as far as to say , "" i don't want to kill someone , "" and in the same breath , he asks some guy where the arsenal is .  i have no problem with violence .  i'm a huge john woo fan , but he paints his films with suspense , skill , style , depth , characterization , and just plain cool violence .  in the films of seagal , the suspense mainly consists of the baddie attacking him stupidly , and him either wounding or killing them .  at some points , they use the cliche of the talking villain , where the villain has the advantage , can shoot seagal , but begins talking by either telling him his big secret plan , or saying a corny line , to which seagal says something hokey back , and has had enough time to devise of a way to do away with them , and does .  this would be okay if there were any suspense or if it didn't take itself seriously at all , like in the case of this summer's "" con air . ""  but seagal is serious about his skill , and of course , his message .  i wouldn't mind if this was a message film in the way that they present it to you with evidence .  but seagal has no idea how to present a film where the message is subtle , not pounded into the viewer's mind .  the villain is totally shallow and cartoonish , thus we can't take him and his motives seriously , and while seagal talks about being kind to the environment , he also goes ahead and blows up a square mile of rig , and kills some workers who were just doing his job .  then at the end , he spends a good 10 minutes giving a speech , just in case you didn't get the message from the trailers .  what seagal doesn't realize is that no one takes his films seriously ( although maybe a couple do ) and any message he has is no only redundant , but doesn't comfortably fit in his film , which is filled to the brim with hokey violence , crap suspense , stupid melodrama , and characters who have about as much emotional depth as a petri dish .  as far as seagal and his acting , he's rather boring .  he squints , he kills .  period .  nothing else .  oh , yeah , there's corny one-liners ( "" i'm gonna reach out and touch someone ! "" ) .  of course , he's the star , and we're supposed to root for him and all , so he makes all the villains unbelievably stupid and a bunch of jerks .  michael caine , who's a great actor , is just supposed to yell and look cold .  he does it well , i guess , but this is no "" alfie . ""  of coure , no one was expecting that caliber of performance from him .  his big henchman , john c . mcginley is kinda boring as well , but is not horrible .  and we even get a small performance from that god of drill sergeants on celluloid , r . lee ermey ( from "" full metal jacket "" ) as a hired assasin squad leader who gets to say the obligatory speech about how dangerous seagal is , just for the movie trailers and for seagal's ego .  and also , look for billy bob thornton as one of ermey's assasins .  anyway , to conclude this all , to judge one of seagal's movies is to judge all of them ( except for "" under siege "" and "" executive decision , "" though the latter is not really a "" seagal movie "" ) .  they all have this same formula , they all have the same action , same villain , same plot , but this one has that message , which makes it more excrucitating to watch .  i mean , if you do rent it , and i don't reccomend you do , make sure you just skip the last 10 minutes .  but i have to put it to seagal for creating a film so bad , that the last film i viewed with my uncle was a pleasurable one .  my ( extra star for the fun it is to watch and mock )  "|-0.8000000000000002|0.8333333333333334|0.9|The overall sentiment expressed in all the explanations is predominantly negative, with the user expressing a strong dislike for Steven Seagal's movies due to their repetitive nature, predictable plotlines, hokey violence, and criticism towards Seagal's acting and delivery.

0|_soldier_ is hands down one of the worst movies a person could ever have to sit through that doesn't have jean claude van damme in it .  i could liken it to the sci-fi cheese that was the hollywood product-of-choice back in the early 80s , but that would be too much of a compliment .  if there is a movie theater in hell , this film is playing there 24 hours a day .  the story , such that there is , revolves around todd ( kurt russell ) , an automaton of a man who has been raised from birth to be a merciless soldier in a not-too-distant ultra-conservative future ( is there any other kind ? )  after years of desensitization at a military academy full of other boys just like him , todd becomes a ground fighter in a series of wars all over the galaxy .  who the enemies in these wars are is never revealed , but the few glimpses of todd in battle show that it doesn't matter , because innocent hostages are wiped out as indifferently as the bad guys .  after ten minutes of this nihilistic trash -- yes folks , there's more -- we see todd as a buff , scarred adult , now so accustomed to the carnage that no confrontation at all causes him to break a sweat .  there's a new wrinkle , though .  todd and his brethren are declared obsolete , and a new batch of soldiers takes their place .  after losing a sanctioned battle with _dragon_'s jason scott lee , the seemingly dead todd is dumped by a flying ice-cube tray ( well , that's what is looked like ) on a remote garbage planet .  if you predict that todd meets a bunch of outcast settlers on this planet , and that they band together to fight a bunch of bad guys coming to destroy them , you're way ahead of the game .  the renegade society on this trash heap is so clich you half-expect tina turner and master blaster to come strolling into frame any minute .  it's surprising that _soldier_ is the brain-child of _blade runner_ co-writer david webb peoples .  unlike that mind-twisting classic , this film contains just barely enough dialogue to fill about three double-spaced pages .  add into the mix the _mortal kombat_'s paul anderson inept direction , and it's easy to see how _soldier_ turned out so bad .  and the special effects !  remember the flying steam irons in hardware wars ?  gary busey is in this movie .  'nuff said .  _soldier_ is proof that hollywood still has plenty of bad ideas sitting in its script vaults .  that this sad film made it to the silver screen should encourage plenty of aspiring screenwriters out there that there is hope after all .  now if you'll excuse me , i have to go weep for the future .  |-0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|"The overall consensus is that the movie ""Soldier"" is highly disliked, with criticism directed towards various aspects such as the story, dialogue, direction, and special effects.

0|"it's a sad state of affairs when the back box blurb is more exciting than the movie contained within it .  such is the case for the 1990 paul mayersberg film _the last samurai_ .  though the blurb alludes to "" a jungle filled with political intrigue , uneasy alliances , and murderous enemies at every turn , "" the story of the movie is actually quite simple ( and prosaic ) : a middle-aged japanese businessman named endo ( played by john fujioka ) and his assistant , both of whom have samurai aspirations , travel to africa in search of his ancestor , who went to bring buddhism to africa .  he hires the services of down-at-the-heels vietnam veteran pilot johnny congo ( the redoubtable lance henriksen ) and his girlfriend ( arabella holzbog ) , and travels to the camp of an arms-merchant-cum-safari-host- cum-islamic-missionary ( john saxon ) and his wife ( lisa eilbacher ) .  they are all kidnapped by an african revolutionary guerilla with witch-doctor aspirations to conceal a pre-arranged arms deal , which subsequently falls through .  congo escapes , finds endo's ancestor's sword , and comes back , guns blazing , to free the rest of them , and endo kills the revolutionary with the sword .  the end .  _the last samurai_ is one of those movies that is neither bad enough nor good enough to be enjoyable .  it is merely _there_ .  the murky plot is filled with subtexts that are never elaborated , subplots that are never explained , and many scenes that make very little sense at all .  the film is shot through with all the tired old "" inscrutable japanese samurai "" and zen stereotypes that are to be expected from an american movie .  it is quite slow-paced , with only a bit of action near the end , and the final duel between endo and the terrorist is quite anticlimactic .  most of the acting is fair , with the possible exception of congo's girlfriend .  lance henriksen is his usual scene-chewing self , and is one of few possible reasons anyone might conceivably have for seeing this movie .  the only other bright spot is the sweeping african scenery .  i paid $3 for this film , from the discount rack at best buy , and halfway suspect i overpaid for it .  if you are in the mood for samurai , read a clavell novel or watch a kurusawa movie .  skip _the last samurai_ unless you are a die-hard henriksen fan .

0|"m : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value .  it tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it's an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses .  it is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human .  the coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols .  the film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence .  except for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed .  as for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen .  m : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue .  the film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point .  the only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film's supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way .  it's a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series .  but its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance .  john woo ( "" broken arrow "" / "" face/off "" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can't seem to handle dialogue and suspense .  the star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast .  cruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one .  their romance didn't work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn't convincing .  the film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success .  we will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville .  first , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it .  he also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain .  which explains the film's mythic theme . . . as  we enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil .  the one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role .  at least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense .  soon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains .  before they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone .  he steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust .  sean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices .  we already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel .  woo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain .  it makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense .  next we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses .  hunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team .  he is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped .  hopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds .  actually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point .  in seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road .  he also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her .  the imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) .  robert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first "" mission , "" who is noted for doing "" chinatown "" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way .  the terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock .  ethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first .  ethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean's getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle .  ethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick's everyone's ass .  if i was only entertained by this . . . i  could have lived with it .  but this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast .  in any case , this is a critic-proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into .

0|"ex-universal soldier luc has to battle a group of newer-model engineered fighters gone bad .  the review  jean-claude van damme has a one-liner early on in universal soldier : the return , his latest attempt to remain relevant , that sums up this entire movie ; he says "" been there , done that . ""  no film critic could possibly sum up van damme's recent film choices any better .  while other ageing action stars have wisely moved into other film genres ( schwarzenegger makes as many family comedies as he does action films ) , van damme stubbornly persists in sticking with what used to work for him : martial arts and guns .  this unwillingness or perhaps inability to move into new genres has caused van damme to enter the straight to video world , with legionnaire never seeing the inside of a multiplex .  he joins fellow martial artist/action star steven seagal as they watch their film careers rapidly fizzle away .  universal soldier : the return is truly poor .  the plot is a complete copy of several action films from this decade , specifically terminator 2 : judgement day and the similarly named soldier .  soldier's kurt russell was an older model super-soldier sent off to retirement when circumstances forced him to battle his successors , for the good of a planet ; schwarzenegger's terminator in t2 tried to save john connor from a newer model killing machine , the t-1000 ; and jean-claude , a former universal soldier , has to save the planet from the rampage of a group of , you guessed it , newer model soldiers .  considering the poor box office performance of soldier , it's amazing that this project was ever given the go-ahead .  luc devereaux ( van damme ) was the sole remaining universal soldier ( or unisol for short ) , until he was returned to a normal , if muscular , human form .  in this sequel ( technically the fourth film in the series , following two straight-to-video duds that were ignored here plot-wise ) , luc is now a human trainer/consultant of sorts for the unisol program .  working with dylan cotner ( xander berkeley , who interestingly also appeared in t2 ) , the unisol program has engineered a tougher , fiercer fighting force with the help of super-computer seth .  unfortunately , upon hearing that the program has been axed by the government , seth takes control of his soldiers , killing everyone in the building except for luc , his partner maggie , his daughter hillary and erin , a reporter trapped inside .  the rest of the film involves luc trying to keep them all alive , while beating up a group of near-indestructible soldiers , most notably romeo ( popular wrestler goldberg ) .  there are lots of fights , gun battles , lame plot developments and a noticeable lack of plausibility .  there are so many clich ? s in this film that it is almost painful to watch .  luc gets saddled with the task of saving erin the reporter early on , and in the course of a single night , they go from bickering to falling for each other , to kissing .  erin is a pathetically-written character ; people are getting brutally gunned down all around her , and yet , not only does this not seem to frighten her , but she finds time to remind luc that she "" isn't leaving without her story "" .  whatever .  other laughable moments include a ) luc going to a strip club to get internet access ( what ? ) and b ) a group of rangers , who after having been given good advice ( luc tells them that their weapons are useless , and shows them a specific gun which should work better ) , choose to go into battle with their useless weapons anyway ( guess who wins the battle ? ) .  not one single scene in universal soldier : the return has any originality to it .  when fuelled by don davis' loud , driving music score , the film's many fights become almost passable , but mostly are full of the same ol' jean-claude moves .  director mic rodgers ( a former stunt co-ordinator ) keeps the action coming at a rapid pace , with only a few token serious moments to be found .  his past work is evident in the many moments when characters are thrown through windows , tossed off of buildings or sent flying through the air thanks to an explosion .  if only jean-claude weren't getting so old and slow compared to younger martial arts film actors like jet li , rodgers could probably have made a decent action film .  to place the blame squarely at van damme's feet , however , is an injustice .  i'm not sure that anyone , not even robert deniro or edward norton , could make writers william malone and john fasano's script sound good .  one particularly painful scene is when erin asks luc how he is so sure that the aforementioned strip club will have internet access .  he cringes , looks down and mutters "" uh . . . uhm . . .  they all do , i saw it on 60 minutes .  eh he he he "" the script's and indeed the entire film's only saving grace is goldberg .  he chews up every scene he is in , obviously enjoying his role immensely .  he even gives the film a few laughs , as he mutters things like "" i really don't like that guy "" every time he fails to kill luc .  sadly , his presence is not enough to turn universal soldier : the return into anything better than a below-average action film that truly deserves to have joined its fellow sequels by going straight-to-video .

0|the plot of big momma's house is martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress .  that's not just the high-concept premise ; it's the fully-realized , all-encompassing plot .  such an emphasis is not unheard-of in the world of hollywood summer entertainment .  one need merely look back to last summer , when the plot of big daddy was adam sandler being an incompetent surrogate parent .  the trap inherent in such an approach is that the high-concept plot idea better be pretty well-realized , or rest on the shoulders of an extremely talented performer , because you can bet there will be nothing else worth a second of your time -- not a developed character , not a provocative theme , not a witty twist .  you will get 90-plus minutes of martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress -- nothing more , nothing less .  those who find martin lawrence more than an occasionally amusing screen presence may have a shot at enjoying the one-note dud that is big momma's house .  others will simply stare , mouth agape , at its sheer unapologetic laziness .  lawrence plays fbi agent malcolm turner , an undercover expert on a stakeout assignment with his partner john ( paul giamatti ) .  dangerous convicted bank robber and murderer lester vesco ( terrence howard ) has escaped from prison , and the feds think he's headed for his former girlfriend and presumed-but-never-proved accomplice sherry ( nia long ) .  sherry , however , has fled with her son trent ( jascha washington ) , possibly to visit her grandmother hattie mae ( ella mitchell ) , better known as big momma .  indeed , sherry appears to be on her way , but big momma is headed out of town without knowing sherry is coming .  that leaves master of disguise malcolm to go under very heavy cover as big momma and find out what sherry knows .  big momma's house's bloodlines are certainly traceable to mrs .  doubtfire -- director raja gosnell edited that film , and the makeup effects were similarly created by greg cannom -- but there's just as strong a whiff of tootsie in the main character's attempt to use his alternate identity to get closer to a woman .  unfortunately , big momma's house makes a ridiculous decision neither of those other films made : instead of having the protagonist pose as a completely manufactured character unfamiliar to anyone elses , it places malcolm in the position of playing a friend and family member to several other characters .  suspension of disbelief in big momma's house requires you to believe every other person in the film is blind and/or stupid , since no one notices that one big momma looks or sounds absolutely nothing like the other .  of course , laughs trumps logic every time , and big momma's house probably still would have worked in spite of its utter disdain for common sense if it had just managed to be funny .  and it misses its best possible opportunity for some great farce by ignoring the simple fact that the real big momma is set up as a foul-tempered beast , while malcolm has to be nurturing in order to get the information he wants out of sherry .  unfortunately , no one involved appears to have the faintest idea how to deal with the comic gold mine involved in one real person pretending to be another , very different real person , so they fall back on an endless parade of sight gags : malcolm reacting violently to big momma's explosive diarrhea attack ; malcolm-as-momma schooling a pair of cocky teens in basketball ; malcolm trying to avoid detection as various prostheses give way at inopportune moments ; malcolm delivering a baby because big momma is the town midwife ( one of the few sequences that works ) .  martin lawrence can be likeable enough at times , but there's no reason to care a whit about his budding romance with sherry because malcolm is never an independently significant character .  he's just big momma without the makeup on .  i won't waste time commenting on how ineptly the set-up of the escaped convict is employed , since it was clearly a waste of time to the film-makers .  there are a few token scenes of lester looming as a threatening figure , but he's ultimately a distraction in a film that's really about its central visual incongruity ( and the accompanying lascivious glances at nia long's posterior ) .  i'm never prepared to underestimate how appealing that idea may be to other people -- several million of them apparently found adam sandler as an incompetent surrogate parent appealing -- but i know that when a film-maker tries to throw a concept at me and pretend that it's an entire film , i duck out of the way .  the gross implausibility of big momma's house might have been tolerable if it was seasoned with more big , cleverly-constructed laughs .  its lack of big laughs might have been tolerable if its characters were at all relevant .  big momma's house is ridiculous _and_ not funny .  it's just a sad exercise in the jaded presumption that any scene should be considered wacky and hilarious if it involves martin lawrence in a fat suit and a dress .  |-0.8833333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is that the reviewer has a highly negative opinion of ""Big Momma's House,"" criticizing its plot as lazy and lacking depth, developed characters, humor, and meaningful themes, while relying heavily on Martin Lawrence in a fat suit and dress for cheap laughs."
0|starring william baldwin ; cindy crawford & steven berkoff all right , the first problem that fair game has is the casting of supermodel cindy crawford in the lead role .  not that cindy does that bad , it's just that anyone who watches this film knows from moment one that that little bit of casting was not done because of cindy's extraordinary acting skills , but for her extraordinary ability to look drop dead gorgeous in any situation .  and in fair game most situations tend to find cindy either soaking wet or very hot and sweaty , but i'm sure that that is just a coincidence , no doubt that these situations were essential to the plot and the fact that cindy looks great wet , well , that's just a happy coincidence .  sure .  william baldwin isn't a bad actor .  unfortunately , he just doesn't demonstrate it at all in this movie .  i'm not sure if that's because most of his lines were just so hokey , or if he was trying to make cindy's acting look good .  if it was the latter , it worked .  cindy does a surprisingly good job here in her first movie .  which is not to say that she doesn't have room for improvement .  although to be fair to cindy , her lines were kinda cheesy in places .  so right about now you are no doubt asking yourself what sort of movie does cindy crawford , arguably the most beautiful woman on the planet , chose for her foray into the world of cinema ?  well , i'm glad you asked that question .  cindy plays a lawyer who by some convoluted plot twists becomes a target for former elite kgb agents .  why woud they target someone as likable as cindy , you ask ?  by the end of the movie you won't care .  the story is so contrived it isn't funny .  anyway after cindy gets blown out of the window of her house , without getting so much as a scratch i might add , she is placed into protective police custody under the watchful eve of william baldwin .  who's character , max kilpatric , a police detective , seems to possess the skills of some sort of fighting machine ( my guess is that the writers have seen way too many of steven seagal's early films ) .  the point is that the idea of the crawford and baldwin's characters of the run from these killer russians isn't all that bad of an idea , it's just everything around that basic idea which kinda stinks out loud .  the supporting cast members are nothing more that over acted stereotypes .  if i was baldwin , i'd hope this film disappears .  as for crawford , she may indeed have some acting ability .  unfortunately , any she does have is obscured by writing that goes beyond bad .  this movie was obviously written with cindy in mind , since the writers spend most of their time finding ways to capitalize off of her looks .  it's too bad they hadn't spent more time on a half decent plot , since ms . crawford is more than capable of looking just fine all by herself thank you very much .  unless you are a huge fan of either baldwin or crawford this is a movie that will only disappoint you .  |-0.7833333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|"The movie ""Fair Game"" receives a negative sentiment in multiple reviews, with criticism aimed at the casting choice of supermodel Cindy Crawford, the poor acting of William Baldwin, and the contrived and uninteresting plot.

""  over and over until he's booted off stage .  there are also a few obviously improvised lines that are fresher than anything that's on the page .  kissing a fool is never as clever as the thursday night joke-machine friends that spawned schwimmer's movie career , so save yourself eight dollars and watch three episodes of that series back to back .

0|"at first glance , i thought that the sword and the sorceror had promise .  its plotline goes like this : the evil king cromwell , desiring to take over the world , resurrects an evil , ancient sorceror , xusia for power .  he attacks the kingdom of eh-dan and kills young prince talon's parents .  given a triple-bladed sword ( which can shoot bad guys , like a gun ) by his dying father , talon vows for revenge .  eleven years later , when he's established his own army , the mercaneries , he vows to take back his kingdom .  along the way , he meets up with alana , whose village is attacked by drunken guards and her brother is kidnapped by cromwell .  talon vows to help , and , after a series of minor escapades , eventually ends up rescuing alana's brother ( and several other prisoners ) , only to be captured himself ( in other words , put on a cross to be crucified ! ) .  fortunately he frees himself , rescues alana from marrying cromwell , defeats xusia , and then cromwell , all with his triple bladed sword ( during the final battle , the blade breaks , but talon finishes cromwell off by using a hidden dagger in the blade ) .  then , everything ends happily .  unfortunately , the sword and the sorcerer is not even half as good as it sounds .  what would have been a great film is completely destroyed by uneven plot jumping , bad acting , and gruesomely gory , bloody scenes .  never once does the story seem to connect together , it just jumps around repeatedly .  this problem is extremely noticeable in the opening scene where cromwell resurrects xusia .  after telling him that he needs his help , he leads the warlock out into daylight , but then stabs him and sends him careening off a cliff afterwards .  wait a minute , didn't the plotline say that he needs the help of xusia in order to invade eh-dan , which he cannot do by military force ?  if that is the case , why does he dispose of xusia after resurrecting him ?  and why does he manage to take over eh-dan anyway ?  these questions are just never - no , never - answered in the film .  another example is that one moment we see talon fighting for his life , another moment we see him just about to be crucified during alana's wedding to cromwell ( ! ) , and finally at the end , instead of settling down with alana , he just tells her to "" wait "" , and then he just rides off !  in addition to the extremely bloody scenes , this uneven plot jumping completely destroys what would have been a great fantasy adventure .  even some attempts to make it exciting , a few fire scenes , battle scenes , don't work .  it just completely fails altogether miserably .  the only good thing about this film is its musical score , contributed by david whittaker , who had an ( extremely ) short music composing career .  the score is boomy and adventurous , powerful , and a billion times better than this film is .  my suggestion : steer the hell away from this bloody mess and buy the soundtrack album instead ( if you can find it ) .  ironically , though , before the film's credits roll , there is a message indicating that a sequel , tales of the ancient empire , would follow .  to my relief ( and delight ) , it never got into production , because the sword and the sorcerer laid an egg at the box office , grossing only $39 million .  critics were right on in slamming the sword and the sorcerer , all right .  leonard maltin rightfully called it "" second rate in scripting , and acting "" and at-a-glance film reviews called it "" a confusing , stupid , unimaginative , unengaging , bloodfilled bore "" .  i totally agree with these reviews , all right , and i hope that this piece of #$% !  will be forgotten about .  there are far better fantasy movies than the sword and the sorcerer .  i hope you get a good laugh out of this review , but i am not laughing .  in fact , my insults don't even come close to the gruesome sickness that this film gave me throughout its 100 minute running time .

0|this movie stinks !  although it is professionally crafted and there are some decent performances , the plot is so bad it drags the film into the abyss .  i knew i was in for trouble when , during the opening establishment shots , we see a detailed close-up of warrant officer paul brenner's ( john travolta ) military identification card and it is the wrong color .  this might seem like a minor detail , but anyone who has spent anytime with the military knows that active duty identification cards are green and dependant cards are yellow .  and what about the senior military officer whose uniform shirt is so wrinkled he looks like he is a recruit on his first day of training .  or what about when brenner tells a suspect that , because he is in the military , he doesn't have the right not to answer his questions even though these rights were central to military law well before the miranda decision .  how hard is it to get someone familiar with the military to check these facts ?  now details like this could be overlooked if the underlying story held up , but this story is so full of holes it is painful to sit through .  for example , at the beginning of the film , paul brenner , an undercover army investigator , gets into a gun and knife battle at his off-post houseboat and winds-up killing an arms dealer he had been investigating .  the local police investigating the death are openly hostile to the military and they discover that brenner has been lying to them about the killing .  but instead of arresting him , or at least take him into custody for further questioning , they release him .  duh !  ultimately , brenner gets assigned to investigate the murder and possible rape of the commanding general's daughter , a young captain also assigned to the post .  when brenner finds graphic sex tapes featuring the general's daughter , does he use them to generate a suspect list and begin grilling suspects .  no , his instinct is to suppress them because they might be potentially embarrassing .  eventually , brenner discovers that this murder is related to a violent gang rape at west point eight years earlier .  i won't even go into the totally unbelievable rationale for the army's suppression of this horrendous crime .  i will just mention one final flaw .  brenner is investigating a crime that occurred in georgia .  the rape occurred in west point , which is in new york .  he is under a very tight ( and totally implausible ) 36-hour deadline to solve this case .  he needs to discuss the rape with a psychiatrist at west point .  does he phone the doctor ?  no , he travels ( via some unexplained very fast transport ) to new york to question the psychiatrist in person , and then he returns to georgia ( again by the miracle transport ) , without once worrying about the impact any of this will have on his deadline .  you have been warned , stay away from this one .  |-0.8833333333333333|0.8833333333333334|0.9|The movie receives overwhelmingly negative feedback due to multiple criticisms including incorrect military details, plot holes, unrealistic actions of the main character, bad plot, inconsistencies in details, unbelievable story elements, and it being painful to sit through.

0|" "" it was not scary . ""  these are the first words that came to mind after it was over .  when a movie is called _vampires_ , "" not scary "" aren't words that should be associated with it .  but that wasn't my only gripe .  john carpenter is a name associated with cutting-edge cinema , as in the intense scares of _halloween_ , _the thing_ and _the prince of darkness_ , or the offbeat action of _they live_ and _escape from new york_ .  unfortunately , the only thing that is cutting edge about _vampires_ is the level of boredom the movie is able to reach .  with an anemic plot and not-quite-kosher special effects , _john carpenter's vampires_ has barely enough substance to slake the thirst of even the least discerning genre fan .  the film is at first concerned with a group of roaming vampire slayers , led by james woods , of all people .  like some sort of holy a-team ( they even have their own souped-up van ) , the bunch invade and wipe out a nest of vampires in a new mexico shack .  their method is amusingly innovative : the blood-suckers are reeled out with harpoons so they can flare up in the sun like matchsticks .  to commemorate their victory , the loutish band decorates a motel room with hookers and parties the night away .  their celebration is short-lived , however , as a master vampire named valek ambushes and single-handedly destroys most of the team .  woods' jack crow and buddy montoya ( daniel baldwin ) escape with their lives , along with a woman named katrina ( sheryl lee ) .  although the woman has been bitten , montoya and crow decide to keep katrina for her psychic link to the master vampire .  the rest of the movie is concerned with the boys' hunt for valek ( thomas ian griffith ) , a freaky marilyn manson-type who's on a mission that dates back 600 years .  along the way they pick up a priest named guiteau ( tim guinee ) , a character who serves pretty much the same purpose as the jittery cpl .  upham in _saving private ryan_ .  some stuff happens in the middle of the movie , but i can't remember most of it , because i often found a twitching hair in the corner of the frame more interesting than what was happening on screen .  _vampires_ finally starts to pick up about 90 minutes into the mix , as crow , guiteau , and montoya assault an abandoned prison-turned vampire nest .  only then does the film begin to even resemble a carpenter flick .  but it's too little too late .  we get the inevitable final confrontation , but it seems tacked on and rather anti-climactic ( come on , we're dealing with _the_ master vampire here ! )  interestingly , last summer's vampire actioner _blade_ was derived from a comic book , and _vampires_ from a novel , yet the latter seems more steeped in campy cheesiness than the former , a more deliberate superhero flick .  woods' jack crow spouts glib off-the-cuff one-liners and strolls away from exploding buildings with that oh-so-cool stride .  and his motive for killing vampires ?  take a wild guess .   ( hint : a ______ killed his _____ when he was just a _____ . )  at least _blade_ had decent action and slick stylishness .  _vampires_ lacks even cheap thrills to mask its gossamer-thin plot .  to make up for this , the movie resorts to other "" shocks , "" such as its generally condescending attitude towards women ( crow slaps them around for the fun of it ) and an overplayed contempt for religion ( crow teases guiteau incessantly about whether his vow of celibacy has made him prone to "" getting woodies . "" )  it can be argued that maybe i wanted too much from this movie .  if not scary and gory , i wanted tense , relentless , and exhausting .  _john carpenter's vampires_ is none of these .  i can only recommended it for the hardcore carpenter fan .  for the rest of you looking for a good scare , beware : _vampires_ is a film with no teeth .

0|"perhaps best remembered as the recently departed news anchor on saturday night live who always started the segment with "" . . . this is the fake news , "" norm macdonald , at times , could elicit some laughter by blurting out semi-offensive phrases in his raspy voice , coated with a condescending attitude .  his shtick was marked by crassness .  in this movie , for example , when his girlfriend says that she's kicking him out because he's been fired from 14 different jobs over the last 3 months , he tries to calm the situation by saying , "" maybe you'll feel better after we have some dirty sex . ""  this kind of humor can only go so far , but certainly can't go the distance in a full-length feature .   "" dirty work "" , is nothing more than a sophomoric comedy about two best friends who grow up only physically .  emotionally , they've never outgrown their pubescent years , which is somewhat amusingly explored in a beginning flashback .  although having no apparent real world skills , the one thing that these two have always been adept at is getting back at people .  if the meter maid was unjust in giving you a ticket , then dump a bunch of unpopped kernels of corn onto the engine block and watch the car burst apart .  mitch ( norm macdonald ) and sam ( artie lange ) need to come up with $50 , 000 in a period of two weeks so that sam's dad ( jack warden ) can have a heart operation .  their idea is to start a revenge-for-hire business where they'll do your dirty work .  in the funniest scene ( and possibly the only funny scene ) of the movie , they take advantage of a live television shoot at a nearby used car lot .  their presence is established , but when a less-than-honorable real estate developer hires them and then reneges on the payment , the two go to work to exact their sordid brand of revenge .  by default , dirty work should treat us to some outrageous revenge plots , but it delivers jerky boys level material .  except for the bit at the used car lot ( and possibly another episode that involves frat brothers ) , the dirty work is uninspired and becomes about as funny as a prank phone call .  already weak on material , it further spirals itself towards the video store by having jack warden constantly blurt out that he has an unsatisfied libido and needs 'broads' and also includes a very unfunny chevy chase as a bumbling doctor with a gambling addiction .  but what's really painfully evident is that norm macdonald has no versatility as an actor .  relying on his trademark of speaking into his personal recorder and saying "" note to self "" ( "" note to self : learn to fight , "" he says after getting beat up ; "" note to self : there's always beer , "" he says after hitting rock bottom ; etc . ) , we feel like we're just watching an elongated rehash of his not-so-glorious days on saturday night live .  much like the television show , for 90 minutes we get one or two funny bits .  the rest of the story is just dead space .

0|summer movies are , by nature , dumb affairs that are usually made for some quick enjoyment and to make money .  wild wild west , the latest will smith affair , follows much the same formula , except that it is dumber and less enjoying than most summer movies .  will smith plays jim west , a black sheriff with a nice line in sunglasses .  he is called by president grant ( kline ) to go on a mission to find out why top government scientists are disappearing .  west is paired up with scientist artemus gordon ( kline again ) and the two track the missing scientists to a legless mastermind , named dr . loveless ( branagh , with a zany moustache . )  before i pile on with the many negatives in this sorry affair , i'll give it a chance with the positives .  there's a nice credit sequence , the production design by bo welch is pleasing to the eye , and the special effects are decent enough .  there's also a pleasant soundtrack .  buried deep in the dross are one or two amusing jokes .  and salma hayek pops up as the female interest , which is always nice to see .  apart from these factors , though , nothing else in wild wild west works .  firstly , there's little chemistry between smith and kline , who appears to be in it purely for the money .  one would expect zingers passing between the two : none arise .  both of them plod through the below standard plot , knowing that there is a pay cheque waiting at the end .  not even kenneth branagh provides much entertainment : although he is over the top , the material doesn't present much opportunity for branagh to be truly crazy .  therefore , he just comes across as loud as obnoxious .  the only enjoyable performance comes from the sexy salma hayek , who is given so little screen time it's embarrassing .  she appears to be in the film to merely show off her body , and be ogled at by kline and smith .  her character also changes at a whim to fit the mechanics of the script , and there is no sense of realism about the character .  the 'humour' in the film is also very off .  will smith put a little spin to his daft lines in men in black , here , not even smith could save the humour on display .  the script largely boils down to insults that aren't very funny , and one-liners that barely raise a smirk .  it's also somewhat racist , although it doesn't intend to be , with one scene with jim west trying to wisecrack his way out of a lynching , and actually says slavery is good to save himself .  it's not a funny scene , and the whole thing comes off rather uncomfortably .  the film also makes the tragic mistake that a man ( in this case kline ) in a dress is automatically unfunny , it isn't , but the wild wild west makes this joke even more painful to watch through pure ineptness .  there's also problems with the plot .  jim west and artemus gordon get caught up in all kinds of sticky situations , but the way they get out of them are always unsatisfying , and rely purely on luck , rather than audience pleasing skill .  plot elements are introduced into the film , and then thrown away just as quickly .  the main piece of the story , a 80 foot mechanical , steam driven spider devised by loveless looks rather impressive , but there's no particular reason why it should be built .  why not loveless build a great big tank , instead of an ungainly , fragile piece of machinery that's just begging to be blown up ?  director barry sonnenfeld always has a breezy look to them , with some nice camera tricks , but even this is missing from this stilted affair .  wild wild west could have benefited from sonnenfelds whacked out style of directing , but not much of it is evident , making this film drag out even more .  it's a sad thing when _four_ ( credited ) screenwriters , a talented director and a willing star can't make a film work , and eventually wild wild west collapses under it's sexist , mildly racist , unfunny weight .  |-0.8000000000000002|0.9|0.8666666666666667|"The summary explanation for these explanations is that the movie ""Wild Wild West"" is rated as negative due to its lack of chemistry between the actors, unfunny humor, problematic racial and sexist elements, weak plot, and its deviation from the director's usual style.

0|`bats' is an insulting slap across the face for any dedicated horror movie fan .  to pull something like this off , you need to have a sense of wit and style , with a heavy dosage of humor to back up the process if the fright factor ever declines .  something like the underground worm thriller `tremors' had just the perfect mixture of these elements , and in return , the film was tremendous fun .  with the notable exception of a wisecracking supporting player , `bats' mainly plays it's premise for straight-arrow horror .  judging by the ridiculous premise , this was not exactly a wise move .  the movie attempts to capture the essence of alfred hitchcock's `the birds' , but fails miserably .  done right , it could have been adequately amusing halloween cinema .  unfortunately , `bats' is a prime example of a formula movie done terribly , terribly wrong .  the only thing amusing about this festering pile of guano is in how intelligible the filmmakers anticipate their core audience to be .  i will recite the following paragraph in a manner that will reach the audience of individuals to whom `bats' is aimed toward .  those guys in hollywood have made a movie about bats .  these bats are not very nice , because they eat a lot of people .  boy , are these bats ugly .  they are infected with this bogus virus that makes them super-duper smart .  they've got big claws and red eyes and they are not very friendly at all .  a whole bunch of people in texas get killed , so a sheriff guy and a scientist lady are brought in to kill the bats .  they have big guns and other cool things to fight them with , but the bats are pretty smart , so it's sorta hard to do .  the bats swoop down and they shoot at them to make they go away for good .  but no , `bats' is probably too violent for pre-schoolers .  the film , directed by louis morneau , should have ventured straight into video stores .  on the small screen , perhaps more fun could have been derived with lower expectations .  but sitting through this crapper on the big screen is almost awkward ; although at a few moments it becomes a guilty pleasure , the film is poorly written , poorly acted and executed with glaring ineptitude .  even the bats themselves are cheesy , and the attack sequences too rushed and jittery to be properly enjoyed .  the sheriff in the story is emmett kimsey ( lou diamond phillips ) , who embodies every pathetic stereotype a small-town authority figure usually portrays ( he chomps on a cigar , struts contentedly in his boots , etc . . . ) .  the scientist is dr . sheila casper ( dina meyer ) , who specializes in flying mammals and is classified as `the best in her field' .  meyer uses a lot of technical terms designed to make the movie seem more intellectually capable , but everything about dr . casper is recycled beyond recognition .  her memories of how she became hooked on the topic of bats sounds suspiciously like oceanographic student matt hooper's tale of how he became infatuated with sharks in `jaws' .  everything revolving around `bats' is tired drivel , which desperately requires some directorial style or acting capabilities to spruce it up .  the supporting cast could have been constructed out of straw , with voices dubbed in later .  in fact , that may have worked out better in the end .  take one glance at casper's bat-loathing sidekick jimmy ( leon ) , and you'll have immediate deja vu - he's the exact same humorous buddy caricature from every other movie , constructed specifically for timed comic relief .  unfortunately , none of his comic interludes are funny .  in the role of deranged mad scientist dr . mccabe , the reliable bob gunton gets cornered with the most hideously idiotic character in the bunch .  mccabe `accidentally' released two experimental test subjects , and the virus spread to other bats .  the entire town of gallup , texas is under attack from an enormous swarm of the creatures , but gunton appears to be inconspicuously contemplating something else .  something like : `when is the damn movie going to be over ? ?  i just want my money . '  the bats are ugly , i must say .  there's the occasional moment where they look moderately convincing , but mainly , the swarm is represented in cheesy digital imagery .  only bits of the bloody action even hint at the campy fun the film could have been , but by the absurdly stupid climax , it's way too late in the game for a decent recovery .  characters experiment in slaughtering the bats with gunfire .  let's explore the logic there : is this really a very efficient way to decrease the bat population ? ?  you could empty an entire clip at the flying winged serpents and not even wound one , and after that there are only 18 , 000 more of them .  this kind of behavior represents the regular level of intelligence behind `bats' .  |-0.7833333333333333|0.9|0.8333333333333334|"The movie ""Bats"" is heavily criticized for its insulting and poorly executed horror elements, predictable plot, poor acting, and cheesy special effects, resulting in a deeply negative sentiment towards the film.
