0|have you ever been in an automobile accident where you've miraculously walked away with only a few scratches , yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable , mangled wreck ?  well , that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation .  but after watching this inane exercise of a movie , i certainly feel that i've miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond .  oddly , `eye of the beholder , ' which is a psychological-romance-thriller , starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent , called the eye ( ewan mcgregor ) , working in washington dc .  in the humorous opening scene , he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down .  using an array of high-tech surveillance and communications equipment , he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office .  the law firm's employees get a good chuckle .  the audience gets a good chuckle .  the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) .  there is something compelling about this mysterious woman .  despite her glamorous looks , however , we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her .  after the murders , she sobs while singing the christmas tune `little bluebirds' and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago .  after each killing , she puts on a different wig , assumes a new name , and then makes her way to another state .  the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions .  but he does not alert the authorities .  he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss .  the eye , it turns out , also is haunted by his past .  his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life .  his tormented psyche creates a ghost-like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation .  she becomes a sort of spectral adviser , and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman .  he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation .  it doesn't matter that he has witnessed all of her murders .  and it doesn't matter that the eye is abnormally reticent , hiding his entire life behind computer screens .  he follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble .  when a crazed druggie ( jason priestley ) attacks her , he shows up for some quick butt kicking .  when the police are closing in to arrest her , he provides a distraction so that she can escape .  all the while , the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight .  peculiar .  how bad is this movie ?  i refer you to my `review quote source' litmus test .  just take a look at the full-page ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes .  for this movie , they are from magazines called `flaunt' and `mirabella . '  no doubt , they were impressed with judd's series of catwalks and disguise changes .  the major problem with `eye of the beholder' is that the film jerks forward , always unsure of its ultimate destination .  if it was a thriller , there was little to keep us entranced .  if it was a love story , there was absolutely no emotional pull .  completely disjointed in structure , it's only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial ( the one where the `6' on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a child's train set ) .  i am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents .  beyond that , the film is hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling .  |-0.3666666666666667|0.7999999999999999|0.8833333333333333|"The overall sentiment towards the movie ""Eye of the Beholder"" is negative, as multiple explanations express disappointment and criticism of the disjointed structure, lack of emotional engagement, inane elements, and questionable endorsements, while also hoping for better roles for Ashley Judd."
0|"bad . bad .  bad .  that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls .  if that summary isn't enough for you , how about t&a , t&a , t&a ?  still haven't got the point ?  other than director russ meyer's predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas , there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie .  that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay .  after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face .  this movie stinks out loud .  quite frankly , this movie deserves a .  but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny .  so i'm giving it a .  and maybe that is too generous .  right from the opening credits , i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands .  not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting , but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform .  i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene .  to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film .  with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained .  so what is this movie about ?  you ask .  like it really matters .  ok , here goes .  this all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry .  once there , they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasn't for their brutally bad singing voices ) , and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them .  everything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral .  there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure , but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing .  >from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here .  other than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have .  the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts .  mr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of "" hey man "" , "" dig "" and my all time favorite -- "" this is my happening , and it freaks me out "" .  now i ask you , with lines like that how can you go wrong ?  ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue .  maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter .  i don't know , but all the big words in the world wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting .  but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie .  i've seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey .  in fact , there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries .  add to the directing and writing the music in this movie .  i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers .  then we have the cast .  first lets start david gurian who played harris , the manager of the band .  this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera .  sadly , his acting doesn't come close to making up for his looks .  if you have been following along up to this point , this shouldn't surprise you .  meyer's stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets .  dolly reed plays kelly , the leader of the band .  and no surprise here , she was cast for her cup size , not her talents .  and yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents .  sadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest .  hey , it a sexist movie , so i'm writing a sexist review .  then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members .  this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie .  meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all .  sure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows .  on the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene .  i sound like i'm writing a review in a porn magazine .  but hey , i'll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked .  and since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey .  the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it .  unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too .  and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d's -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet .  this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs .  an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls -- beware : this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense .  proceed with extreme caution .

0|" "" pokemon 3 : the movie "" has a lot of bad things in it .  first of all it's a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents , badly written script and fantastic animation .  the first film came out the end of 1999 and was a huge hit grossing almost $90 million domestically .  a sequel soon followed and even made $45 million .  warner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its a waste of time and celluloid .  this time ash ketchum and his friends are on their way to the johto battles ( which my little brother told me the new spinoff is "" pokemon : the johto journeys "" so go figure ) anyway he comes in contact with a young girl who's father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown .  they are small pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities .  the unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly's house and creates every wish she wants .  now it's up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one .  too bad really that this is a bad movie , surprisingly the first movie was entertaining and somewhat absorbing , the second was a piece of trash and this one is almost in between .  it has some good qualities ( animation , message in the end ) but the flaws seem to overpower the goods .  i'm still not sure what the big thing is about pokemon , they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language ( besides meowth , my personal favorite ) and you don't understand what they are saying .  my little brother just thought the movie was amazing , and i kept leaning over and asking him happened , or what pokemon that was .  his response was a big lecture of how this is that , and that is this . . . he  sure did put me in my place .  with the second and third movie being bad , i have a feeling pokemon 4 : the movie might be a total bust as well .

0|1 . he doesn't have a hard-to-decipher accent , 2 . he doesn't always speak in a monotone , and 3 .  his face doesn't always wear the same impassive expression .  in short , the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad , but too bad to be good .  unfortunately , the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle , firestorm , which is just plain awful .  one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woo's broken arrow ) is that he's so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery .  as ace firefighter jesse graves , long is supposed to be playing a bigger-than-life action hero -- the kind of he- man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers .  unfortunately , despite the best efforts of first-time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costner's work in the postman look stark , jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy .  to put it kindly , this is not a well-written motion picture .  firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich ? s which , taken together , form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot .  the only reason this film is getting one star ( instead of something lower ) is that most of the fire sequences are realistic , and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively .  we're introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people .  during this sequence , our big burly hero proves that he's also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog ( yes , the dog lives ) from being broiled alive .  flash-forward a year .  now , our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association , replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins ( real actor scott glenn ) .  but this day , our big burly hero's first in charge , isn't going to be business-as-usual .  a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom .  led by randy earl shaye ( william forsythe ) , the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border .  along the way , they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress ( suzy amis ) .  eventually , our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire , rescue the damsel in distress , defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , and restore order to the galaxy .  firestorm's director , dean semler , is a former cinematographer ( he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves ) , so it's no surprise that the film looks good .  unfortunately , that's firestorm's lone asset , and it falters near the end , when computer-generated special effects fill up the screen .  these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game .  the action sequences , which include a variety of chases , are occasionally interesting , but never invigorating .  everyone , including long , appears to be going through the motions .  there isn't a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end , unless you count the forest fire , which generates some heat .  as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die , william forsythe lacks panache .  he's worse than a generic bad guy ; he's a boring generic bad guy who doesn't have any snappy one-liners to hurl at our big burly hero .  my advice to scott glenn ( absolute power ) and suzy amis ( titanic ) is to accidentally forget this film the next time they're making out a resume .  there's some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list .   ( at least i hope there aren't 10 worse films than this . )  and i know i wasn't the only one who really disliked this movie .  as the audience was filing out of the screening , i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments .  the general consensus seemed to be that , although the movie sucked , the promotional key ring was cool .  the problem is that fox won't be giving out key rings to regular movie-goers , so that nixes any reason to see firestorm .  |-0.8166666666666668|0.8666666666666667|0.9|"The general consensus among the explanations is that the movie ""Firestorm"" has a negative sentiment due to its poor quality, lack of memorable performances, and presence of clichés and bad lines."
0|"seen at : amc old pasadena 8 , pasadena , ca ( in sdds )  paul verhoeven's last movie , showgirls , had a bad script , bad acting , and a "" plot "" ( i use the word in its loosest possible sense ) that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity .  it stank .  starship troopers has a bad script , bad acting , and a "" plot "" that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore .  it stinks .  nobody will watch this movie for the plot , but here's a brief synopsis anyway .  some friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve ( armed forces ) at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy .  after one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires ( the home city of the main characters ) , war is declared .  this involves sending the grunts , who include johnny rico ( van dien ) and dizzy ( meyer ) , down to the surface of the bugs' planet .  much carnage ensues .  the troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer a distress call .  more carnage ensues .  after being rescued , their plans are changed to capture a "" brain bug "" which is believed to be controlling the aliens' battle plans ( look , i didn't write this , ok ? ) .  yet more carnage ensues .  get the picture ?  interspersed throughout all this are brief "" ads "" from the federal network , which present the picture of a neo-fascist state , much like in verhoeven's robocop .  there are many problems with starship troopers .  the plot , where one exists to drive the movie onwards , is silly .  harris ( star of tv's doogie howser , md ) is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie , apparently so we will accept his ability to mind-meld with a "" brain bug "" later on .  in addition , the first thirty minutes of the movie ( until the characters sign up for service ) drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills , 90210 .  the characters are one-dimensional , so much so , that when dizzy is killed , she says it's ok because she got to sleep with rico .  i had hoped that verhoeven's use of a no-name cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience , but such an idea appears to have escaped him .  the dialogue is embarassing and isn't helped by the frequently terrible delivery ( i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice a few hundred people for the good of the species ) .  finally , the fake "" ads "" become a nuisance .  although they evoke the propaganda of the wwii-era movietone reels ( as presumably they are meant to ) , their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect .  some people will say all of that's irrelevant -- the movie hinges on the battle scenes .  so what about those battle scenes ?  well , i admit the effects are good -- the bugs move about quite convincingly , especially when they have been deprived of a few of their limbs .  and people have their brains blown out , their limbs cut off , and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways .  but this is my problem .  the entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore , and its continous attempt to gross us out ( starting early on when richards' character vomits on-screen ) .  verhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success , but fails spectacularly .  while robocop had a message about the importance of being human , and gave the bad guys some motivation , starship troopers lacks even these simple features .  when the brain bug sucks out a character's brain near the end of the film , it's merely an analogy for what the film has done to us .  this film is full of graphic violence and is not suitable for children under 16 .

0|"often similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into , the call of the oboe ( o toque do oboe ) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray .  many elements of the film are solid , and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know , but they simply don't convert into a solid work .  although a setting is never established , it becomes apparent .  the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day .  the community is a dull one , where every day is a downhill slide from the last .  over time , the people have taken to themselves .  the town cinema is closed , no tourist has passed through in years , and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger .  so what happens when a "" tourist "" ( paolo betti ) does arrive one day ?  he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock .  it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby .  when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance , the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years .  it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers , and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film , thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages .  the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner ( leticia vota ) who also happens to be engaged to the town's police inspector , a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiance's involvement with this musician .  the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray .  it features a character who literally rises from his grave , a woman who has a phone conversation with god , and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character , to an almost humorous drunk .  technically , this film is a nightmare .  the music score is poorly edited into the film , so it is often choppy , rough , and abrupt .  the lighting is poor at best , which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes , and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words , and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases .  this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue , but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words .  in addition , the pace of the film seems uneven .  it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test one's patience .  the film then moves into a faster pace , that again slows towards the end , as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark .  there was , however , potential for this film .  it is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music , and the re-unification of people .  these are all topics that could easily fill a movie .  perhaps , if there were no freak show , and the technical aspects were to improve , there might just be a thing of beauty at the end .  most importantly , though , the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours aren't such a bore .  until then , there seems to be little more hope for this piece , than that boy has by simply crying out "" mommy "" while he wanders astray in a park .

0|"a friend invites you to a movie .  this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare , and be grounded in reality .  the plot is as follows : after a terrifying incident , a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city .  they need fresh air to get some perspective , maybe to start over .  romance begins to brew , however , as one of the locals , played by an international superstar in rugged clothing , sparks things up , ( especially at a country-western slow dance ) .  it stars a rising young starlet , helms a good cast , and is directed by one of the better actor-turned-directors in hollywood .  you accept .  you jump at the opportunity to see , what you believe to be , _the horse whisperer_ .  but , poor moviegoer , you have been conned .  alas , you find yourself watching , incredulously , _hope floats_ .  oh , woe .  your hope has sunk .  why was this movie made ?  why was it released ?  it is a travesty on nearly every level , and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved .  at the hands of a better script , the film could have been a gem .  but it is clueless as to what it is about , and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers .  _hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy , who , after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend ( on national television no less ) , takes her daughter and drives back to her home , helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands , ( she decorates with stuffed wildlife ) .  birdy's nephew , travis ( played by _leave it to beaver_'s cameron finley ) , is under her custody , and in one of the film's many failed in-jokes , is always seen wearing a different halloween costume .  what is the point of this ?  does it make any sense ?  is it supposed to be funny ?  the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric , but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child .  all of this undercuts the plot , of which there is none .  there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion .  there's the scene where birdy , who used to be the prom queen , is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked , for a job .  there's the scene where birdy dances with her father , in the hospital for alzheimer's .  and then there's the sentimental scenes with justin , played by harry connick jr . , who is taking a liking to her again , showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch .  and during each of these scenes , i was sidetracked by my earlier question .  what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume , a kermit costume , a cowboy costume ( with whip ) , and a full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner ?  what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life ?  outside of this , there are other sure signs of screenwriters block .  when the daughter stands up to the bully at school .  when birdy almost loses her job .  when the family pulls in a goofy lip-synch to cheer someone up .  when someone dies .  when the daughter cries , ( no , wails ) in exasperation that her father is not coming back .  in a movie like this , you notice the strings being pushed , and you sit there , comatose , hoping it will end .  who can survive such a debacle ?  i worry for bullock's career , which has been running on auto-pilot for the last few years .  she has an attitude , a solid perkiness , and can drive a bus--but she can't handle the emotional scenes , much less hold a southern accent .  harry connick , jr . is worse--stick with singing , or get some acting lessons , please !  gena rowlands is the best part of the film .  but she's such a good actress , that it staggers the mind that she's weighed down by such lukewarm material here .  it would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes' great films is known for this film .  two notes to forest whittaker : ( 1 ) cut the slow-motion sequences .  there are twelve times where you undercut your own direction by such a failed trick .  have you done so , you could have shaved off ten-minutes of this almost unbearable debacle .   ( 2 ) you've had to know something was wrong if your cinematographer's filter makes the candlelight appear like little "" x "" s .  you're not a bad director , but you can't change a terrible script .  there's a recurring scene where birdy , working at the neighborhood fotomat , finds the machine go wrong , and image after destroyed , warped , dark image appear .  think about it .  a succession of destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie .

0|"any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates .  frankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director's greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement .  unfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be '90s thriller .  almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities .  the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what's going on so that these flaws in logic don't become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled .  unfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they're happening .  this is a very bad sign .  not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder .  of course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters .  a perfect murder isn't a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott's play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock's version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling ) .  emily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas ) .  their marriage isn't going well -- emily resents steven's controlling instincts , and , as a form of rebellion , she is having an affair with a penniless painter , david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) .  when steven learns of the relationship , he decides to confront david , but his approach isn't that of a typical cuckolded husband .  instead of yelling or threatening , steven offers david a proposal that's too good to resist : for $500 , 000 in cash ( $100 , 000 before , the rest after ) , he is to break into steven's new york apartment and kill emily .   ( of course , after getting the first payment , david never bothers to ask how he's supposed to get the rest . )  ultimately , i'm not sure which of the three main characters we're supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband , who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover , who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman , who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair .  not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they're not interesting .   ( it's possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn't . )  steven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes .  the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks .  michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep -- he's gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife .  gwyneth paltrow , who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors , is simply awful here .  she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998's worst thrillers ( the other being hush ) .  at least viggo mortensen ( g . i .  jane ) has a little fun with his part , but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies .  the thin supporting cast includes david suchet , the star of "" poirot , "" as a police inspector , and sarita choudhury ( kama sutra ) as emily's best friend .  a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end .  there aren't many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script , which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start .  it's surprising to see director andrew davis , the man behind the fugitive , involved in this mess , but , like his stars , he too needs to earn a living .  it's just that remaking hitchcock , and doing it so badly , hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough .

0|steve martin shines but sgt . bilko  fails to impress  based on the popular 50's sitcom , sgt .  bilko follows the string of old-sitcoms-to-movie conversion fever .  remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back ?   ( brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped ) .  i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy , but the tv-conversion-movies are hitting our screens like wildfire , sad to say , with mixed success .  such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following , the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie .  sgt .  bilko ( frankly , i have not seen any its original tv version ) , even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd ; failed to entertain .  sgt . ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool ( place of vehicle storage and repair ) of fort baxter .  though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of , he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money-making opportunities ; from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4-d pools .  though materialistic in mind , bilko's methods has thoughtfully `enriched' the lives of the men of fort baxter , providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that .  colonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn `blissfully-confused' state , bilko has managed to hide his operation , though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it .  bilko's state of ascent is suddenly under-fire when the pentagon sends major thorn , a tough cookie on army regulations , to check on the progress on the $70 million hovertank project , a new weapon under development within the fort's grounds .  to add to his problems , thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major `sabo' done on him by bilko during their younger army days .  director jonathan lynn , who directed my cousin vinny ( in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best-supporting actress ) managed to pull sgt .  bilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter , but that is about it .  there are really not enough laughter-packed-moments in sgt .  bilko to fully entertain the average movie-goer .  still , steve martin's sgt .  bilko is played with finesse and full-force by the renowned comedian .  without him , sgt .  bilko would have just fell flat on its face .  sgt .  bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world .  the current trend in mixed successes in such tv-conversions may be a blessing in disguise , really ; at least it will force hollywood to re-think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv-idea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity .  unless you are a fan of the tv-series or love to watch steve martin in action , you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres .  i'm sure there are better ones around .  |-0.5333333333333333|0.8166666666666668|0.8500000000000001|"The overall sentiment expressed in the explanations is negative towards the movie ""Sgt.

0|an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england .  the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects .  more specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character .  even twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive .  although , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive .  the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure .  if it weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 .  and with good reason -- the acting isn't great and neither is the writing .  well ok , we don't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film .  but one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary .  with no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens .  you don't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint .  i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen .  but john , it just wasn't scary .  i didn't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn't work for me .  actually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films .  but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me .  it's never a good sign that you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material .  call me crazy , but you shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it .  i'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up .  werewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) .  boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy .  including , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital .  the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse .  i know it sounds strange , but it actually works .  the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie .  as i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects .  while they are still impressive today , they aren't impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film .  and since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch .  actually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn't take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way .  |-0.39999999999999997|0.9|0.8000000000000002|"The overall sentiment towards the movie ""An American Werewolf in London"" is negative, with criticisms of mediocre acting, writing, lack of scares, and a mix of comedy and melodrama that didn't work well.

""  they of course begin making out and the credits roll .  i'm not going to talk about how stupid the line is or how , if they'd really wanted to go for a bad closing line they would have had baldwin say , "" you think i could settle out of court ?

0|"house on haunted hill ( 1999 ) starring taye diggs , geoffrey rush , ali larter , famke janssen , peter gallagher , bridgette wilson , max perlich , lisa loeb , james marsters , and chris kattan .  directed by william malone , written by dick beebe ,   "" house on haunted hill "" initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie-like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible .  one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck .  a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water .  these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b-horror flicks , with grunting noises and cadaverous movements .  except this time , at the end of the millenium , the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be .  in past horror films , the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims .   "" house on haunted hill "" doesn't want their audience to have an imagination , everything is provided for them to watch and squirm , not think .  this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film .   "" house on haunted hill "" , which is based on the 1958 film of the same title , introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can , following the opening blood fest .  the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot .  the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling , unexpected shots of blood , guts , and mayhem .  however , the film is neither scary nor unpredictable .  the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush ) .  each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money .  since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring , the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them .  the problem is that every character is not likable .  the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter ) .  the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic , that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them .  the worst character in this film , or maybe in any film released this year , is chris kattan's watson pritchett .  he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate , that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself .  waiting for pritchett to die , was a strenuously difficult act to sit through .  the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price ( an homage to victor price who starred in the original ) .  playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party , he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face .  however , rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price , played by famke janssen .  the main problem is that "" house on haunted hill "" is not scary .  to top off that huge disappointment , every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous .  if the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped ( similar to "" deep blue sea "" ) , the goal for creating a creepy , suspenseful action film was completely missed .

( her character is also named ana ? s . )  sitting at the table morosely slurping down a banana split , her presence is grounded and heartbreaking .  it's a pity breillat never finds anything for her to do other than get defensive against her evil storybook sister , 15-year old elena ( roxane mesquida ) , for bringing a transitory boyfriend home to their shared room .  in this summer cottage , ana ? s has no escape from her position as stoic bedside observer to elena's depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance .  the boy in question , a smug italian college kid named fernando ( libero de rienzo ) is a real piece of work , claiming that the experience is a declaration of love while begging for a blowjob .  ana ? s doesn't receive any warmth from her largely absent parents , who join elena in making fun of her hefty girth .  she finds pleasure in wandering the beach alone , singing songs to herself , and swimming in the pool kissing the metal railing and pretending that it's her paramour .  reboux commands the screen , but there's only so much a child actress can do recounting pretentious monologues to herself .  if one is inspired to rescue this young performer and place her in a better movie , at least she fares better than the other young talent asked to perform in intense love scenes that might feel justified if they weren't so dramatically misguided .  this 83-minute vignette is something of a horror show , but breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end .  on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members , gigantic trucks swerve by as the hour grows late .  will mommy fall asleep at the wheel ?  perhaps .  or maybe there's something deadlier around the corner , lying in wait to pounce upon the unsuspecting fat girl .  what's more , she might even like it .  with the intent of being unfair and unpredictable , placing her heroine in the most diabolical of corners in order to face up to impending adulthood , breillat's extreme flourish of sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor of contempt .  fat girl is a bitter pill indeed .  aka ? ma soeur !  screened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) .

"" dad couldn't listen .  and mom couldn't cope , so they got rid of me . ""  paulie , the autobiography of a talking , not merely a mimicking , parrot , has jay mohr in the lead role of the bird - the voice , not the body - and as the minor character of benny , a small-time crook who uses paulie to pull off small scams like stealing twenties from atms .  as the parrot , mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up .  benny , on the other hand , is a character you've seen a thousand times before , and mohr brings nothing new to that role .  roberts's deliberately slow pacing of laurie craig's script lends a subtle sweetness to its humor but creates some definite problems .  when a kids' movie wants to mosey along , watch out .  if the material is not crisp and perfectly composed , beauty can sometimes dissolve into tedium .  so it is with paulie .  when they let their bird do his stand-up comedy routines , the show hums and the audience roars .  too often , however , a sleepy silence ensues among the viewers as they wait for the story to pickup again .  tony shalhoub , the smart-mouthed chef from big night , plays misha , a recent russian immigrant to the u . s . he had been a teacher of literature at home , but now he makes his living as a janitor in the animal research lab to which paulie has been taken for study .  although misha gets a few nice lines ( "" i'm russian .  i like long stories . "" ) ,  his somber part seems designed only to elicit our sympathy .  besides paulie , the only character worth noting - other than 2 cute small parts played by cheech marin and gina rowlands - is the speech-impaired marie , played in a precious performance by cinematic newcomer , 5-year-old hallie kate eisenberg .  naturally enchanting , she gives the picture genuine heart .  the bad news is that her part is confined to the first half .  the best scenes have the bird dancing and strutting to show off his comedic skills .  when marie's family gets a cat , for example , the bird , who hasn't wanted to learn how to fly until then , takes an instant interest in soaring .  tricking the cat while insulting him at the same time , paulie calls him a stupid hairball .  their rapid physical antics add to the humor of the situation .  it's good quality sitcom material but performed by animals .  when one of the humans without much of a voice begins to sing , paulie cringes .   "" i'm a bird , "" he explains with his frequently subtle humor .   "" i have a small brain , and it's about to explode . ""  the movie contains rich doses of john debney's dreamy music .  with heavy use of a solo violin , he keeps reinforcing the film's heart-warming themes .  and when paulie finally takes off in flight , the orchestra comes up loud and strong with cymbals clashing .

"" it's the only kind he knows , "" reflects misha .  and the motion picture , which runs the standard length for a kids' movie , still feels too long .  the best parts are enthralling , but then there are all of those dead spots in-between .  paulie is a movie that never quite lives up to its promise but manages to charm nevertheless .  paulie runs 1 : 32 .  it is raged pg for a few mild profanities and would be fine for all ages .  my son , jeffrey , age 9 , gave the movie * * with his biggest complaint being that there wasn't enough action .  he thought paulie was funny , and the actress that played marie was quite good .  his friend sam , almost 9 , thought the movie was "" awesome , excellent , "" and gave it * * * * .  he thought paulie was good , but he didn't believe the way marie's speech impediment was acted .

"" porky's , "" tells the story ( if you can call it that ) of four clueless high school buddies , pee wee ( dan monahan ) , billy ( mark herrier ) , tommy ( wyatt knight ) , and mickey ( roger wilson ) , whom desperately want to get laid .  women , for the most part , are a mystery to them ( and in this movie , they are to the audience , as well , since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet ) .  their plan is sidetracked , however , when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porky's , which they are able to get into using fake id's .  after they pay the manager one-hundred bucks for three hookers , they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building .  for these four teenage guys , this means war on porky's .   "" porky's , "" ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level .  as a teenage sex-romp , it is not wild or amusing enough .  as a comedy , all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat .  as a look back at the 1950's , it is something , i suspect , most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave .  and as a revenge movie , it is a crushing bore .  one of the most offensive things about , "" porky's , "" is how jaw-droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers .  the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters , and we learn very little about them , except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool .  that sure is revealing information .  the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark .  the women are all treated as objects or comedy props , rather than real people .  for example , the two gym teachers , mrs . balbricker ( nancy parsons ) and honeywell ( kim cattrall ) , only have one purpose , and that is to be made fun of .  mrs . balbricker is a gruff , no-holds-barred , overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness , and , in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved , honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog .  there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses ( even though i have the suspicion they are not ) , but one thing is for sure : they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny , only humiliating .  to prove how out-of-touch this so-called comedy is , compare it to other more serious 80's films about teenagers , and it looks even worse in comaprison .  any of the john hughes pictures , such as 1984's "" sixteen candles , "" or , 1985's "" the breakfast club , "" put , "" porky's , "" at an even greater shame .  those films actually dealt with serious teen matters , but remained a great deal funnier , thanks to their bright and truthful writing .  and heck , if , "" porky's , "" wanted to be a teenage sex movie , i'd take 1982's "" fast times at ridgemont high , "" or 1982's "" the last american virgin , "" over this any day of the week .  director bob clark is not a bad director .  two years after he made , "" porky's , "" he directed the nostalgic holiday classic , "" a christmas story . ""  i would forgive him for this misfire , in fact , if it wasn't for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay .  just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage , and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world , is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in , "" porky's .

0|"okay , i just don't know why , but i seem to be getting this diversion to disney-made real-life actors movies . . . as  well as real-life acting tim allen movies .  i couldn't even make it through "" the santa clause , "" so why did i even see this ?   ( just to make an idle point , i did like "" toy story , "" but that was good ) also , i have this aversion to bad french farces , and if they remake them into american films .  well , this is my excuse : it was prom night , i'm not a prom person , my best friend and i impulsively went to the drive-ins where they were playing "" grosse pointe blank "" - wouldn't mind seeing it again - but i had to suffer through this first .  i agreed to go .  ugh .  in all fairness , i can say that at least this inane plot wasn't dreamed by an american .  it was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of "" little indian , big city "" ( french title - "" un indien dans la ville "" ) .  i stayed away from it like it was limburgher , and according to roger ebert , that was a good idea .  but i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement .  the stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his current marriage .  let me clarify : his wife ( jobeth williams ) left him years ago , and i mean years - around 13 or so - and went to an island in the carribean or something .  he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this . . . thing   ( played with an emphasis on over-done by lolita davidovitch , who is usually good ) .  she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off .  he meets him , he has a weird name ( mimi seku , i think . . . or  as the bad joke goes - "" mitsubishi "" - laugh track cue ) , he knows english , they fish , more bad jokes , pirhanna joke , the kid has a pet spider , he makes a promise to take him to the statue of liberty . . . you  know the drill .  now this is where the plot complicates ( well , complicates for this one , at least ) : the fish-out-of-water joke switches from tim allen on an island to his island son in new york city .  tim is a stock broker and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasn't able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is - martin short .  a russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere ( how come in every hokey french import , there is a mob ? ! )  tim learns a lesson of life from his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries .  the story is crap , the jokes are hokey and not really funny , and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting .  but the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldn't help it .  the whole time , i kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up and several more grown people had to do this .  at the end of filming , did they all scream out , "" we've made a great movie , guys ! ""  i sure hope not .  big question to get from this film : why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if they're just going to do it the exact same way ?  huh ?  my ( for some of the actors' names and a joke or two that made me chuckle , i guess . . . okay ,  so i really feel bad for it , so i only gave it one star )  "|-0.7833333333333332|0.8833333333333333|0.7666666666666666|The overall sentiment of the explanations is negative, as the reviewers express dissatisfaction, disappointment, and dislike towards the movie.
