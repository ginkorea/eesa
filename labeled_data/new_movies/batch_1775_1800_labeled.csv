0|"sometimes a stellar cast can compensate for a lot of things , and "" pushing tin "" certainly features some name stars who are going places : billy bob thornton , cate blanchett , angelina jolie , and oh yes john cusack who might not realize it at first , but he's actually the * veteran * among this quartet of fine-looking people .  sometimes a terrific cast like this can compensate for a lackluster screen treatment of an idea that has "" hip comedy "" written all over it , compensate for workmanlike but uninspired direction , compensate for an obnoxious score that would have anyone but the tone deaf screaming for the exits , compensate for clich ? d characterizations , compensate for embarrassing "" you have to be joking "" situations .  etc .  in "" pushing tin , "" thornton , blanchett , jolie , and cusack don't have an earthly .  from the opening sequence the film is in big trouble : squiggly , "" quirky "" credits , fake-looking passenger planes circling new york , and anne dudley's in-your-ear music making us wonder how she ever got that best original score nomination for "" the full monty , "" let alone won it .  but i , for one , wasn't ready to walk just yet .  so quickly we descend into a tightly-edited air traffic controllers montage which screams to us in large capital letters these people have a difficult job , yes , what with their frantic , mile-a-minute instructional personas , juggling planes and passenger's lives like some huge , real , mid-air video game .  hip , cool , demonic auctioneer nick "" the zone "" falzone ( cusack ) is the best in the biz .  of course .  until some hipper , cooler , leather-clad flyboy assist in the guise of russell bell ( thornton ) shows up to challenge falzone's finite air space .  boys will be boys and some heavy duty testosterone starts exuding , then the macho one-upmanship begins .  it doesn't stop with seeing who can juggle three 747s within a cat's whisker of each other .  oh no .  there are some broken hoop dreams , some wanna-see-how-fast-i-can-drives , and then the ultimate showdown : was that my wife i saw you with last night ?  director mike newell ( "" four weddings and a funeral "" ) must have read a different draft of this script because the one that's being acted out up there between newark , jfk , and la guardia doesn't have an ounce of subtlety , and newell has made some awfully good-and funny-movies before .  the antics of these air traffic controllers will make you cringe .  they'll make you frown in disbelief .  they'll have you constantly looking at your watch .  but wait !  there's still 100 minutes to go ! !  the film's only saving grace is blanchett , whose connie falzone is a spunky , brash , long island housewife who wants to better herself by taking art classes .  this is a wonderful accomplishment for the fine actress who has previously played a red-headed australian gambler ( "" oscar and lucinda "" ) and a tempestuous british monarch ( "" elizabeth "" ) .  but she's not enough to save the picture .  thornton looks terrific and performs solidly but his character is a joke .  jolie ( as russell's knock 'em dead wife ) isn't bad , but the up-and-coming actress disappoints by allowing herself to be displayed like a plaything .  cusack cracks gum , dons shades , and acts hip throughout but , like everything else in the film , his performance is forced .  in the last ten minutes or so , for some inexplicable reason , things start coming together and you begin to get a sense of how this film might have been , like the trailer teases .  but it's too little too late .  a fine cast aside , "" pushing tin "" is nothing more than an embarrassment .

0|"the most depressing thing about the depressingly pedestrian james bond film "" the world is not enough "" is its final frame : white letters on a black background proclaiming "" james bond will return . ""  oh i certainly hope not .  with pierce brosnan in his third and reportedly last go-round as james bond 007 , "" the world is not enough "" is the best example to date that "" 'enough "" is enough .  in this , the 19th chapter in the seemingly-endless franchise featuring ian fleming's debonair british secret agent who likes his martinis--and his nemeses--shaken not stirred , the sub-inspired screenwriters have chosen to rehash all of the setups , stunts , and sexy encounters of the previous 18 bond flicks rather than coming up with anything the slightest bit original .  we've got previously-used speedboat chases , ski chases , and sticky situations aboard nuclear submarines .  we've got a couple of hot-to-trot babes without an ounce of acting ability between them .  we've got a post-cold war megalomaniac bent on world domination slash destruction ( here played by a skinheaded robert carlyle with mean , lean panache ) .  and , as has been the case since 1977's "" the spy who loved me , "" we've got a plot that has nothing whatsoever to do with anything conceived by mr . fleming .  we've also got a main title song by garbage to which , with very little effort , you can fit the lyrics to * both * songs from "" tomorrow never dies . ""  while originality was never the series' strong suit , the films were almost always fun , with at least some thought going into the nonstop stunts .  i can't think of one memorable set-piece in the entire--and very dull-- "" the world is not enough . ""  in addition , michael apted ( yes , the respected director of such films as "" coal miner's daughter , "" "" nell , "" and the "" 28up "" documentary series ) takes embarrassing advantage of the full range of bond clich ? s .  you get the "" talking killer "" plot device--you know the scenario : the bad guy has the good guy at his mercy yet waxes poetic just long enough to die of old age .  and you get a slew of high-priced assassins who can't hit a barn door at 20 paces : in the film's opening minutes ( of an endless 128 ) , bond chases a sultry sniper along the thames and the leather-clad lovely fails to hit bond's souped-up "" fishing boat "" with a bazooka when he pulls within a few feet of her .  later , she takes off in a hot air balloon with bond dangling from a guy rope beneath her but is still unable to take him out .  these reliable absurdities are more frustrating than usual since there are no distractions other than occasional ads for luxury automobiles , vodka , or credit cards .  in and among the rampant product placements , brosnan grapples with carlyle , "" braveheart "" 's sophie marceau ( as former kidnap victim slash heiress elektra king ; she's terrible ) , "" wild things "" ' denise richards ( as a nuclear physicist lord help me ; she's laughable ) , and judi dench as m . dame judi brings the only shred of dignity to a series that has long since jettisoned its self-respect ( about the time roger moore inherited bond's walther ppk ) .  brosnan goes through the motions with the grace and charm you'd expect of the former "" remington steele "" star , but even he has to be thinking there's more to life than an easy paycheck .  he's given plenty of wiseacre asides to deliver , but only one of them-- "" i don't know any doctor jokes "" --made me chuckle ( although "" i thought christmas only comes once a year "" is more in keeping with the series' penchant for grown-worthy puns ) .

0|"when walt disney pictures announced a live-action feature based on the '60s cartoon series of "" mr . magoo , "" special interests groups representing the vision-impaired let out a cry of dismay .  mr .  magoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented .  in fact , they were wrong .  mr .  magoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind , it's an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity .  it's stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas .  look at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you'll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr .  magoo .  the best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining .  the worst , mr .  magoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be .  the first problem with mr .  magoo is the script .  despite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr .  magoo is comically barren .  from beginning to end , there's not a laugh to be found .  every attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud .  you'd think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that's not the case .  i've had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures .  then there's leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus ) .  in the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun .  lately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr .  magoo .  even if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we're reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but "" top form "" is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here .  this is strictly a take-the-money-and- run operation .  the story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber .  the cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often .  the bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts-type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed ) .  matt keeslar portrays one of magoo's sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo .  the bumbling man's other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus .  most of mr .  magoo's humor comes in the form of failed slapstick .  the cartoon violence level in this film doesn't approach that of home alone 3 or flubber , but it's still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices .  there's a non-violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr . bean's recent , similar misadventure , it doesn't hold up well .  then there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo's near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby .  i'm willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack .  tong , a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market , has helmed several jackie chan movies , including first strike , rumble in the bronx , and supercop .  his chief talent , that of choreographing martial arts fights , is wasted here ( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch ) .  like john woo ( hard target ) and ringo lam ( maximum risk ) before him , it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream .  it is worth noting that , unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under-10 crowd while driving parents to distraction , mr .  magoo appears to bore viewers of all ages .  the screening i attended was wall-to-wall kids , and , for the most part , they didn't seem to be enjoying themselves .  when the film was over , i asked one little girl what she thought of it .  her pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words .  mr .  magoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer , sight unseen .

0|david spade has a snide , sarcastic sense of humor that works perfectly on the tv sitcom just shoot me .  it also served as a good showcase for him when he co-starred , opposite the late chris farley , in tommy boy and black sheep .  lost and found marks the comedian's first attempt at going solo in a movie , and it also reveals that when spade doesn't have a reliable back-up system , his brand of humor seems more desperate than one may expect .  david spade is not the problem with lost and found .  he plays dylan ramsey , the sweet main character , to the best of his abilities .  the story revolves around dylan's obsessions with his beautiful new neighbour , lila dubois ( sophie marceau , from braveheart ) , and her terrier named jack .  dylan believes that the best way to a woman's heart is through her dog .  and so he kidnaps jack , planning to stage a fake rescue , in hope to win lila over .  there are three good things about lost and found .  the first is spade .  the second is sophie marceau , a lovely actress who's been planted into the wrong movie .  lastly , there's the dog , who is used here in a similar context to puffy from there's something about mary .  unfortunately , director jeff pollack finds more humor in putting jack through a cycle in the drier than he does with simply making him look cute .  this kind of physical humor is dead .  pollack does everything but beat the poor pooch with a baseball bat to get laughs , and this procedure is cheap , unfunny and resoundingly cruel .  this is where i start to get fuzzy .  also in this unusual blend is ( apparently ) a sweet-natured love story between dylan and lila .  given the mean-spirited comedy that the movie is obviously striving for , i found this hard to swallow .  and , why does dylan even deserve someone like lila , after kidnapping her precious dog and putting it through such pain ?  predictably , lost and found opts for a happy ending , one that feels so sentimental , gooey , and rings so false that it sets off a siren in your head that makes you feel a bit cheated .  david spade ( who also co-wrote the movie ) tries hard , so very hard , to make this project amusing .  there are some choice scenes that are quite funny , but the movie is only sporadically funny .  patrick bruel plays the stock character of rene , the pompous jerk who also wants to win lila over , with his good looks and money .  jon lovitz and martin sheen are welcome additions in two tiny supporting roles .  despite a few positive attributes , lost and found just doesn't work .  if you're searching for an enjoyable romantic-comedy , you could do far better than this obvious , misguided failure that shows a blatant disregard for what it's trying to present .  |-0.2333333333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|The overall sentiment of the explanations is negative, with criticism focused on the mean-spirited comedy, cruel treatment of animals, false happy ending, desperate humor of David Spade, and disbelief in the love story.

""  the film's plot doesn't have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting .  feldman's story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable .  they simply could have called it "" action movie . ""  every character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies .  adding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a "" road runner "" cartoon .  action movies don't have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you're not thinking about the lack of realism .  the only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography .  there are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires .  the film's main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell .  unfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants .  the dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing .  it's a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming "" lethal weaponesque "" adventure .  tango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes .  seeing russell in drag is the movie's funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials .  furthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence .  machine guns and torture generally don't mix well with comedy .  jack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain .  his character , however , is run-of-the-mill , except for his strange obsession with mice .  like many movie villains , palance likes to play games .  in fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room .  you have to wonder why palance doesn't just shoot the detectives in the head !  the story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent .  teri hatcher plays stallone's sister and russell's love-interest , and she is just as pretty as can be .  but regrettably , hatcher's acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty .  every time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination .  there's really very little , if anything , to recommend in the film .  and , more to the point , tango definitely isn't worth a penny of your cash--so don't bother .

""  the story revolving around john , meanwhile , is extemely thin throughout , particularly for its 104-minute running time , and it alternates between uninspired comic relief ( as in when the students see their sex education teacher working as a stripper at the club ) and heavy-handed melodrama .  the romance between john and his girlfriend had the potential to be an adequate subplot , but we also learned very little about her , which is unfortunate since amy smart , whom i don't think i've seen before in past films , is probably the only character written with any sort of intelligence .  smart does not allow her character to become the "" passive girlfriend , "" instead coming off as a young woman with her own ideas and opinions .  it's too bad the camera didn't linger on her long enough so we could hear some of those thoughts .  the adult characters probably fare the worse of any , since they all must play residents of a dim-witted town that cares about nothing but football .  john's relationship with his parents can also be telegraphed far in advance .  his father is set on him becoming a football player at a university , but john doesn't want any part of that .  his mother stands beside her "" big , strong husband "" and is a passive female .  finally , jon voight plays the stock bully coach character and he does nothing to make the thankless role any more than one-dimensional .  saving "" varsity blues "" from being a total washout are a few amusing sequences , including one set in the sex education class , which did get a laugh out of me .  the scenes of playing football were well-shot and thankfully didn't overstay their welcome , as many sports films fall victim to .  but leaving the theater , the question i had in my mind was why did this film need to be made ?  i seem to be asking this question quite a lot lately , since the same old stories seem to be cranking out of hollywood .  do we really need another high-school sports film ?  no , we don't , and certainly not one of this low-caliber , which felt like a cut-and-paste job of spare parts from much better , but similar , films .   "" varsity blues , "" no doubt is the first one , however , to include an earnest scene in which one of the characters is only wearing whipped cream on their private parts .

0|"for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality , trois is surprisingly tame .  despite it's lurid subject matter and it's passing nod to fatal attraction , it moves along with flat , uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film .  freshly moved to atlanta , jermaine ( dourdan ) and his wife , jasmine ( moore ) , have the trappings of a perfect life .  they have a beautiful house in suburbia .  jermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm .  jasmine is his supportive wife , who is finishing up her college degree .  in an opening montage via a home video of the pair , we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs .  this is a couple that has it all .  into this eden slithers the lure of lust .  despite his outward appearance , jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person .  a glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business , oblivious to jasmine's concerns .  we also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage- a-trois , much to jasmine's dismay .  as jermaine puts it , "" don't you want to be sexually free ? ""  jermaine shares his desire with co-worker terrence ( smith ) , who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter .  the woman , jade ( palmer ) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine .  jade , at one point was a college student , too .  unlike jasmine , she found herself pregnant , dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet .  to further reinforce their differences , it's revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son .  inevitably , through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaine's part , the forbidden act is consummated .  the aftermath of the encounter sidesteps into fatal attraction territory as acts of violence are perpetrated upon jermaine's property with the hint that the violence may escalate .  by this point , trois shows itself to be a soap opera without the requisite melodrama : a fatal attraction without the social significance .  the exploration of relationships is strictly superficial and stereotypical .  jermaine comes off as insincere , sexually driven and selfish .  jasmine is bland and subservient .  jade comes off a bit sympathetically , but that is negated by her moral bankruptcy .  yet another tale of a sexually aggressive "" dog "" of a man who imposes his will upon his accommodating , innocent mate .  the last 10 minutes will undoubtly throw you a curve , but by this point , will you even care ?  if the rest of the movie was as dynamic as the ending , perhaps there could have been some freshness to it .  as it stands , trois is pretty standard fare .

"" caligula "" allegedly tells the true story of the evil roman emporer of the same name , a man who was so insanely decadent that his assasination came as a blessing . . . or  so i guess , even though almost every single roman emporer was assasinated as well and for much the same reasons .  the film opens on the wrong note , of course , with a quote from mark appearing before any image graces the screen , using the over-used passage "" what shall it profit a man if he should gain the whole world an dlose his own soul , "" depite the fact that the opening scene of the film is of the emporer before he was an emporer , fucking around with his own sister in a field ( i suppose if one has to lose their soul , one has to have a soul in the first place ) .  the plot is so incomprehensibly done that all i or anyone else can make out of it is that caligula ( disastrously played by the great malcom mcdowell , a performance that does the opposite that his performance in "" a clockwork orange "" did ) is next in line for the throne but can't wait for the current emporer , tiberius ( peter o' toole - ditto , only for his performance in "" lawrence of arabia "" ) , his grandfather , to die . . . so he kills him and ascends to the throne .  then he abuses his position , marries a woman ( helen mirren , who retains her dignity as an actor by not exactly acting ) so he doesn't just have to sleep with his sister ( a dreadful teresa ann savoy , there to be pretty , naked , and willing to hop in the sack with mac or anyone he asks her to hop in with ) , abuses his position a little more , a little more , and a little more , and then , i believe , invades england , then is killed off .  the filler , instead of recounting his life , is supposed to be , as guccione claims , the ultimate portrait of decadent pagan rome , complete with orgies , vicious deaths , and lots of nudity .  but instead of being the historical accurate film it really really wants to be , it instead becomes guccione's twisted masturbatory image of what it could be like .  oh , isn't it great that they just loved having sex ?  and that they killed people so disgustingly ?  and wouldn't it be great if i could make a couple bucks by selling this shit off as accuracy even though it's so blatantly real bad porn that i've completely convinced myself that it's not .  i mean , why not just show a roman orgy when i can spend a good ten minutes examining every single facet that makes it up .  and it's not just that it's disgusting or vile or whatever adjective you want to use to describe this film - it's that in a film where the entire feel it's going for isn't felt , it's also the sloppiest expensive movie of all time .  the sets are lavish , but so blatantly innacurate that i wonder if no historian wanting to have his name on this film explains this .  but that doesn't matter since the cinematography is so dark that you wonder if a light meter was used at all , making this not only dark and ugly , but just plain dark .  the camera operation is also the worst i've ever seen in my entire life .  not only does this film hold the record for the most unnecessary zooms in one single shot ever , but often the camera will lose its subjects and pan around till they find them , then have them out of focus .  the editing is so sloppy that some scenes are absolutely impossible to follow .  there is no writer to speak of ( what the hell does it mean that it's "" adapted from an original screenplay by gore vidal ? "" ) , but nevertheless , the dialogue is shit , so laughably bad that i can't in good faith believe that anyone with an iq over 5 could say them with a straight face ( my favorite being the line when caligula inquires the doctor about the health of the dying tiberius : "" he could go at any moment , but with care , he could last a year or so . "" )  the music in this film is mostly prokofiev and khachaturian ( they use his gorgeous "" adagio of spartacus and phrygia , "" ad nauseum ) , used in an attempt to give the film some emotion , but instead feels as if it was shipped in from elsewhere .  the orgy scenes ( and one infamous lesbo scene between penthouse pets lori wagner and aneeka dilorenzo ) are the result of reshoots by guccione himself , which are so obviously removed from everything else in this film that it only adds to the embrassment ( every five seconds or so , the film cuts to random nudity , as if it was afraid its audience would forget this film is rated "" x "" ) .  john gielgud represents the only voice of sanity , walking around in his brief role as if he was constantly the mantra , "" i'm going to kill my agent , i'm going to kill my agent . . . ""  and so on and so on , for over 2 1/2 hours , making "" caligula "" about as exciting and enriching as a three hour college lecture class and twice as deliriously annoying .  guccione , in his pursuit of historical accuracy has instead made a film that is such a painstaking , arduous task to watch in its entirety that i doubt anyone can sit through an hour of it without irreversible psychological damage .  throughout the entire film , the presence of guccione is easily felt , as if he were standing there at the edge of the screen , pretentiously looking down upon us saying "" look what i can get away with !  and if you don't like this , then you're a prig , and worse than that , you know nothing about history ! ""  uh huh .  there's a clear difference between historical accuracy and doing something that's artistically good .  a film which showed roman decadence as something that was perhaps liberating for some but could not last - that would probably make for a good film .  but using historical accuracy as a licence to get away with any kind of disgusting-for-disgustingness'-sake acts is total , total bullshit , and all i can say is that guccione and the makers of this film have lost any kind of touch with either entertainment or eroticism , and have developed a pathetic and sadistic taste for both , judging from this film .  there's a film that came out in 1989 called "" the cook , the thief , his wife , and her lover , "" a magnifcent film by legendary cult director peter greenaway ( also starring helen mirren ) , which deals with graphic sex , heartstopping violence and gore , and even a little cannibalism for good measure .  that film not only never patronized its viewers , but also handled them in a way that was shocking , yes , but also , in a bizarre way , entertaining and totally involving .  there were real characters there in a real situation , and best of all passion and just the right amount of restraint as not to get off on the fact that it's going to be offensive to many .  that film achieved everything it wanted to do , and has since retained a status as one of those cult films that is not only popular but actualy good .  and it's everything "" caligula "" might have been but , alas , wasn't .

0|"remember back in the mid 1990s when crime and macabre movies were all the rage ?   "" pulp fiction "" and "" fargo "" both managed to get oscar nominations for the best picture , and not surprisingly , a slew of rip-offs followed in the years thereafter .  that fad seems to be over but here comes christopher mcquarrie writing and directing "" the way of the gun "" that at first glance looks like another of those wanna-be's but upon closer inspection doesn't look like anything comprehendable .  it's a crime story so wrapped up in its own little world it has a claustrophobic atmosphere - a film that won't allow the story much room to expand outside its handful of characters and somehow still manages to turn a simple premise into something so complex its ridiculous .  complexity should come as no surprise to anyone who's familiar with mcquarrie , he wrote "" the usual suspects , "" which has become a cult favorite despite little critical acclaim .  that film had a great story and was well directed but had such an elaborate , confusing screenplay it leaves many viewers scratching their heads after repeated viewings .  you have to wonder if mcquarrie really had everything mapped out or if he was going for the hollywood idea that "" if it's really confusing and about criminals and cops that makes it fascinating . ""  with "" the way of the gun "" mcquarrie seems to be capitalizing on the same idea , but this time the story is far less commercial - a shame because maybe that would have helped .  the film tells the story of two drifters with no ambition and barely a reason to live but aren't hell-bent on death either ( played by ryan phillipie and benecio del toro ) .  they get lucky when they hear about a scheme between a big-shot exec guy and his trophy wife who are going to have a baby through in vitro fertilization .  they figure they can kidnap the surrogate mother ( played by juliette lewis ) and get a nice ransom .  along the way we continually learn of the shady dealings between the exec , his wife , their hired goons and the "" bag man "" ( played by james caan - the only actor in the film who looks like he knows what he's doing ) .  the exec is some kind of money launderer so he obviously can't call the authorities for help .  his goons and the bag man are on the kidnappers' trail and each make different offers to get the mother back .  the exec's son is a doctor who also gets pulled into the fray and wants to make sure his patient is all right .  meanwhile each of these characters has something hidden up their collective sleeves and the double-crosses , secret love affairs and torrid pasts come as no surprise even though little of it has any relevance at all .  mcquarrie doesn't know the meaning of the word simple .  he seems to be more interested in showing us how clever he is than making a good movie .  everything has to be complicated and confusing , so much so that it's to the point of surrealism .  nothing is what it seems in this reality , it's one of those movies where you get dropped right into the middle of the criminal world and are expected to know most of the industry's rules and regulations .  every scene with caan's character exemplifies this perfectly - the kidnappers already know who he is and even chat with him , getting into conversations about "" the business "" and how it works and we're hardly given a clue as to what they're talking about .  these characters are probably supposed to be great criminal sketches but they're more like ideas ripped-off from sketches found in david mamet's trash .  no one here really acts like a real person , and the story is even further removed from reality .  it's like a dream without any appeal .  take the opening scene for example ; the phillipe and del toro characters are in a parking lot across the street from a bar or a club counting their money and stuff .  they sit on a brand-new mercedes and the car alarm goes off , the owner is waiting in line and yells at them to get away from his car but they don't move .  the guy and his loud-mouth , potty-mouth girlfriend and about 20 other people cross the street and gang up on them .  you'd think phillipe ? and del toro are ? going to pull out guns and scare them away but they don't , instead phillipe throws one punch and the two get beat down by a mob .  there's a lot of things i didn't understand about this scene : first of all the owner of the mercedes isn't some yuppie or old rich snob , he's like a hippie straight out of the 60s .  secondly , the two main characters seem to believe that they can actually take on the mob unarmed .  lastly , it serves no purpose in the long run because later in the film the two are packing more artillery than a small country's army .  if they were suicidal they wouldn't have gone on the kidnapping job in the first place ( and where they get all those guns is never explained either ) .  there's a lot more i could pick apart about this film but that would be an exercise in futility .  what it all comes down to is that nothing here is what it seems - which would be great if this movie were about pretty much any other story than what it is .  absolutely none of the characters are likable or believable .  and it's all coated with a thin layer of black comedy which is good for a chuckle here and there but this film is definitely not a flat-out black comedy and its use of such seems like a desperate attempt to kill screen time .  with any film you see , whether you like it or not , you can at least understand what the appeal was to it , why someone would want to make it and why someone would want to see it .  i can't say either for "" the way of the gun , "" because it has very little going for it and i can't imagine anyone intelligently defending it .

0|this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time .  a fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyone's favorite goalie-mask-wearing homicidal maniac .  jason , the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area , doesn't start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel .  while he does have a small role in this film , we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count .  the plot , like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this -- crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as he/she/it possibly can in the space of a 90 minute movie .  the reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story .  but for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in a movie such as a plot , here are the basics .  a bunch of unsuspecting teens get a summer job at a long closed summer camp .  they are days away from the arrival of the kids and they are spending their time fixing the place up and making sure it is ready for the kids .  sadly , they start being butchered one by one by the bloodthirsty killer .  at this point i would usually say something about the quality of acting , directing or maybe something about the high quality of the production .  since i'm not going to do that , feel free to assume that if i did , it wouldn't be positive .  i will say that this movie looks as if it was made for about a hundred bucks , and that includes the actors' salaries .  if you are used to recent horror films like scream , you are in for a bit of a surprise .  the only saving grace for friday the 13th is that it was really the first of its kind , with the killer taking real pride in their work .  using as many methods of murder as they could .  none of this single murder weapon stuff life that unimaginative leatherface in chainsaw massacre , or the creatively stifled imagination of halloween's michael myers who just used brute force or a really big kitchen knife .  nope , in the friday the 13th movies , you can always count on the killer taking great pride in his work .  one fun fact about this movie is that the cast includes a very young kevin bacon , although after this movie it is a wonder he ever worked again .  the main reason to see friday the 13th is if you want to watch all of the series from the beginning .  if not , stick with the later films with jason , everyone's favorite hockey fan .  friday the 13th is the sort of movie that is fun to sit down and get a couple of scares from , just don't sit down expecting a whole lot .  |-0.4666666666666666|0.8166666666666668|0.8000000000000002|The sentiment of the text is overall negative, with criticisms of the low production quality, lack of plot importance, and negative tone towards the movie's plot, production, acting, and directing.

0|this is the worst movie i've viewed so far in 98 .  the avengers = silly = man dressed in a bowler hat + woman wearing tight leathers > evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits + greater evil , sir august de wynter wearing kilt .  the question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast ?  the same question was probably asked of last year's stinker batman and robin .  i feel the production got a little too smug , the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie .  my greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed ( thurman and fiennes ) ? something that was a vital element of the 60's tv serial of the same name .  the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks , but does not allow much room for character development and interaction , except to perhaps grate on the viewer's nerves .  one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality .  connery as sir august , does not fair better than thurman or fiennes .  his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather , mostly embarrassing and poor quality .  if there is a movie you would prefer never to see , i believe the avengers would be a good choice .  for one thing , you will not have to witness a product that is far inferior to the three high profile names that is associated with the title .  i cannot understand how something so poorly produced could have been released , but i put it down to one of those freak happenings in nature , like lightning you can't see it coming until it hits you .  |-0.9166666666666666|0.9333333333333332|0.9166666666666666|"Overall, the explanations indicate that ""The Avengers"" movie has received extremely negative reviews due to criticism of various aspects such as poor chemistry between main characters, a weak script, disappointing production quality, and the consensus is that it should be avoided."

0|mr . bean , a bumbling security guard from england is sent to la to help with the grandiose homecoming of a masterpiece american painting .  the first two words should have said enough to let you know what occurs during bean's trip to la , but if they didn't look out because you are in for a rather interesting if not odd ride .  heck depending on your humor you might end up laughing through the whole flick .  either way look out america bean is coming .  well , what can really be said about this movie , there is very little discernible plot .  that much is not hard to grapple with for it is a slapstick comedy .  it achieves that goal rather admirably , but because it is that , the plot is just screaming for help .  the whole premise that the movie is based on is to say the least flawed .  the movie had its funny moments but there was no real story line other than something that could be thought up on a whim and carried through and in many causes ad-libbed as you went .  don't go into this movie expecting and theatrical masterpiece .  but if this form of humor floats your boat then you will truly enjoy this movie , even if you don't like slapstick style humor you will end up laughing because something's are just so stupid .  the movie goes out and accomplishes what it aims , or so it seems .  now when you look at the acting in this movie you have to think about two things , first was there any real acting and how hard is it to act in the slapstick manner .  well , there was no real acting in this movie but some of the slapstick wasn't the easiest i am sure .  i have to concede that mr . atkinson's acting in this movie is well done .  although the role isn't too demanding the slapstick is .  i think that the character could have had a bit more dialogue , it would have added quite a bit to the overall effect of the movie .  now the rest of the actors in the movie , bad acting and poor casting .  i think that the role opposite bean could have been better , just seemed wrong for the movie .  a different actor might have done a better job of it but i wont presume that wasn't what was trying to be achieved .  one thing that i must say , simply to get if off my chest is that i think transferring a sitcom to tv usually produces rather disastrous results .  tv shows should do just that stay on tv , it will probably save some producers from getting ulcers .  i can only think of a couple examples of tv going to the big screen effectively , the best known of those would have to be star trek .  bean seriously fails to accomplish anything close to what that series gone movie achieved .  now another thing that i have to state again is this movie has narrowed its target audience fairly tightly .  the form of humor in this movie will not be liked by most people , these people will think like i did that this movie is stupid and pointless .  but if you like the tv show you might actually like this movie .  but to be on the safe side i am opting to recommend you save your money and not go to see this movie .  there are many movies that are truly worth seeing unlike this one .  |-0.11900000000000001|0.7966666666666667|0.75|The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly negative, with mention of flaws in the plot, bad acting, and poor casting.

0|wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of bricks falling on you .  you can see its plot developing from a mile away . you  are lured into its benign story of a single 29-year-old girl looking for a soul mate in boston , as that city is depicted as a mini-wonderland for singles .  this is a star oriented film , and the star who carries the film is erin ( hope davis ) .  that this is a dating film , about singles who for reasons of fate or luck , or whatnot , have not had a successful match and are now putting most of their energy into fulfilling their careers , is nothing new , this type of film has been done often and better many times in contemporary films .  the fictionalized documentary unmade beds did it more provocatively and with more of a sense of urgency than this film . the  main quirk in the plot here , is that hope's pushy mother ( hollan ) visits her in boston , sees her daughter's live-in relationship with a radical protester ( hoffman ) breakup and decides to put a personal ad in the newspaper for her harvard medical school drop-out daughter , who works as a nurse .  this is done without her knowledge .  it is cornball sitcom stuff , but , at least , it is handled as best it could be by the actors and director .  it is easy to like erin , she is bright , caring , and attractively blonde .  it is equally easy to care for the soul mate she keeps missing contact with , the financially strapped , ruggedly handsome , intelligent 35-year-old alan ( alan ) , who no longer wants to work with his father as a plumber but is doing volunteer work at the aquarium and attending college to be a marine biologist .  of course , he comes across as being so good ( though , he does kill some fish in the aquarium ) , that it is hard to believe he's for real , or just some cardboard shining knight put into the story to give it an ideal to shoot for .  the contrived story revolves around their near misses in meeting each other in such spots as , the subway , at a restaurant , or on the phone .  alan's brother answers erin's ad with a few of his pals , as they each try to respond to her ad in a phony way , making a bet that the first who gets to tongue kiss her , that the others witness , will win the bet .  this sub-plot was as obnoxious to see take place as it is to hear told .  that we have to see erin go through several dates to prove the point how ego sick these guys are , each one more annoying than the other , culminating in the most obnoxious one of all , that brazilian lover ( jose ) , who is about as charming as a snake-oil salesman , who is actually the one she nearly flies away with for a holiday in brazil , was not only incredulous but downright contrary to the rich presentation of her character that was the heart of the story .  anyway , as expected , all's well that ends well , for this watchable piece of fluff , that comes over on screen better than it does when relating its story-line .  the dialogue was actually not bad , those dating erin or trying to flirt with her seemed to be uttering authentic things they would actually say in their situation .  and , oh , by the way , wonderland refers to the stop on the boston metro , it is where greyhound racing takes place .  |-0.6833333333333332|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|The overall sentiment is negative, as the reviewers criticize the film for its lack of subtlety, common plot, contrived subplots, unlikable characters, and compare it unfavorably to other contemporary films.
