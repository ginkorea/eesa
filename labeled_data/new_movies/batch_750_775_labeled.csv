1|"what's shocking about "" carlito's way "" is how good it is .  having gotten a bit of a bad rap for not being a big box office hit like pacino's previous film , "" scent of a woman , "" and not having as strong a performance as he did in that one ( he had just won an oscar ) , "" carlito's way "" was destined for underrated heaven .  that's what it is : an underrated gem of a movie .  and what a shame because pacino and de palma both do amazing jobs with it , and turn it into a great piece of a pulpy character study .   "" carlito's way "" deals with , well , carlito brigante ( pacino ) , a puerto rican ex-drug kingpin , who gets out of a long jailterm when his coke-addicted , curly-haired lawyer ( sean penn ) points out a legal technicality .  of course , carlito was actually awoken in prison , and has decided to go straight , even if he's really a crook at heart .  carlito , like barry lyndon , is a man who is trapped by fate at every turn , and can't escape into something he is not .  carlito's attempts at a clean , legal life are thwarted at nearly every turn .  when he first gets out , a friend of his ends up leading him into a big shoot-out , where he has to kill a couple people to survive .  he's constantly getting bugged by the government to see if he's doing anything illegal , and his lawyer finds himself neck-deep in a pile of shit , needing him to try and help him out , which includes him doing some prison breaking .  carlito , like ratso rizzo , wants to go to miami ( since , according to film logic , that's where it's at ) , but needs some funding .  being a legend , he is quickly able to get a nice job running a big dance club ( this is the 70s , by the way , and since some of this takes place in night clubs , we get to hear all sorts of 70s classics , including several k . c .  and the sunshine band tunes - my personal favorite ) .  he gets a bodyguard ( the great luis guzman , at his best ) , and is soon running a pretty good business , even if he's constantly attracting underworld young thugs , like benny blanco "" from the bronx "" ( john leguiziamo ) , who is more than once pointed out to be a young version of carlito .  on the other side , the symbol of promise and hope , is gail ( penelope ann miller - what happened to her ? ) , his girlfriend from before prison .  she's a goregeous ballerina , and a stripper , and soon carlito is trying to get back with her , and take her with him when he finally leaves for miami .  while this relationship is never fully defined or anything , we get a sense of love between them , and they have some truly interesting scenes between them ( she never gives him addresses or locales - he always has to track her down ) .  all of these elements clash together at the end , in a brilliantly executed , emotional climax , which is inevitable .  when i say inevitable , i mean we see it at the beginning and then backtrack , putting a great spin on it .  sure , it's going to eleveate some of the tension , but it gives the film a lot of depth , as carlito is seen trapped by fate .  what's amazing is the big chase sequence ( amazingly done by de palma ) has a lot of tension and thrills .  like "" apollo 13 , "" we know what's going to happen , but we're still thrilled by what happens in the middle .  it's also very emotional , thanks to a great script by david koepp , and amazing performances by pacino and miller .  de palma is famous ( or infamous ) for lots of violence in his films .  his earlier flim , "" scarface "" ( which starred pacino in the lead ) , has a ton of it , especially at the end ( and a nasty chainsaw scene towards the beginning which i'm still not over ) .  but de palma actually reigns in more quieter scenes .  to me , the best scene in the film is when carlito is on top of a building , looking down into the room where gail is doing ballet .  this is the most brilliantly done , and most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire film , and probably the best in de palma film history .  with a gorgeous soprano duet in the background , and rain pouring down onto a trashcan lid covering carlito's head , and a saddened , remorseful look on pacino's face , it's a tear-jerker ( well , for me , i dunno about you . . . ) .  the acting from all is great , especially from the three leads .  pacino was panned for his performance , chiefly because his accent wasn't puerto rican enough and , well , it wasn't as "" strong "" as his oscar-winning role in "" scent of a woman . ""  well , his "" scent of a woman "" performance was great and all , but it was nothing really but , as comic kevin pollack said , a "" foghorn leghorn impression . ""  in "" carlito's way , "" he's emotional , and strong , despite the fact that he's remorseful over his entire lifestyle , which he cannot change .  i felt more for carlito brigante than i did for the tango-dancing , insult-throwing blind guy in "" scent of a woman . ""  as i said , penelope ann miller is great , and she and pacino actually have very good chemistry .  and they're scenes are well-written , with some good clever dialogue which adds some interest to an otherwise bland relationship .  and sean penn is amazing as the coke-addicted rat attorney .  every scene he's in , he has great energy , and even measures up to the greatness that is pacino .  in smaller roles , john leguiziamo and luis guzman are great .   "" carlito's way "" is one of those films which you heard about briefly , but when you finally watch it , you're absolutely blown away .  it's a wonderful film , a highly underrated little masterpiece which was shelved after it didn't do so hot .  but trust me and check it out .  it's a great little film , and proof that the residential critics and mass populus are not always right .

1|"life is beautiful is a rare treat : a lighthearted comedy that tackles a very serious subject without committing the sins of being disrespectful , or , even worse , humorless .  it combines a charming romance with a dash of farce , stirs in a little poignancy , and ends up a very enjoyable movie .  it's an italian film , but don't let that discourage you .  subtitle-phobes will be missing a wonderful experience .  life is beautiful opens as a sweet romantic comedy , with the clownish , but good natured guido ( roberto benigni ) arriving in a rustic italian town to work as a waiter for his uncle .  the year is 1939 , and guido literally stumbles into the girl of his dreams , dora ( nicoletta braschi ) .  their romance seems to be picture perfect , with only one stumbling block : she's already engaged to another man .  can guido overcome the odds and win his girl ?  what do you think ?  however , five years later , things have taken a turn for the worse in italy .  the fascists have stepped up their race initiatives , which is bad news for the jewish guido and his new son giosue ( giorgio cantarini ) , who are rounded up and shipped off to a concentration camp .  unable to protect his boy in any other way , guido attempts to shield his young son from the horrors of the labor camp .  he pretends that everything is all an elaborate game , with points awarded for such tasks as hiding , being brave and being very very quiet .  as you can tell from the description , life is beautiful has two very different tones , but manages to excel at both of them .  as a romantic comedy , it is sweet and funny .  as a bittersweet tale of hope amid despair , it is touching .  roberto benigni's work here has been compared with some of the best of chaplin's , and it is easy to see why .  he is able to run the gamut of comic expression , from slapstick to farce , with a warm-hearted feeling that celebrates his downtrodden hero's "" triumph of the underdog "" spirit .  life is beautiful treads a thin line when it turns its attentions to the holocaust .  however , it is able to successfully navigate the minefield , without demeaning the gravity of the horrors involved , nor without losing its humorous edge that allows you to smile through the tears .  with life is beautiful , benigni has created a triumphant , but bittersweet comedy .  it's quite simply one of the most enjoyable times i've had at the movies this year .

1|you've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi , but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over `keeping the faith' .  it's a fluffy comedy , thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer , regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head-on .  as youngsters , brian finn , jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio .  while their friendship progressed , anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support , so neither would feel excluded .  but tragedy soon struck , as anna was forced to move away .  now adults , brian ( edward norton ) and jacob ( ben stiller ) hold similar but contrastive jobs .  the likable and kind-hearted father brian is a catholic priest , while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi .  on the basketball court , they refer to themselves as `the god squad' .  in the relationship field , brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy , but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory .  everything changes when anna ( jenna elfman ) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums .  now a workaholic , she devotes endless hours per week to her business , but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob - both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again .  with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail , there's bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters .  predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult , but `keeping the faith' is open , entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a to point b .  edward norton has emerged as one of the finest , most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood - a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller `primal fear' .  after shockingly bitter roles in `american history x' and , most recently , david fincher's vicious `fight club' , a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice .  not in the least .  norton slips into the director's chair for the first time with `keeping the faith' , and here his incisive , resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg .  weighing every aspect , it is unanimously an impressive directorial debut .  in addition , norton pushes all the right buttons with the sheepish sweetheart brian , generating a thoroughly likable screen presence .  stiller ( the zipper guy from `there's something about mary' ) is firm and funny , boasting a fully-ripened comic maturity .  elfman's perky repetition can grow tiresome ( such is occasionally the case on tv's `dharma and greg' ) , but she seems perfectly rambunctious here .  the remaining cast members offer fine support , from anne bancroft as jacob's animated jewish mom to milos forman as an elderly priest quick to contribute intelligent advice .  `keeping the faith' is the perfect date flick . . .  though perfection is not a word to associate with the film in general .  there is turbulence during the process of lift-off , as numerous failed attempts at establishing the situation cloud the projected comedy ahead .  once the film does settle in , it is often funny and always cheerful .  stiller , norton and elfman have created three enormously lovable personalities .  we enjoy their interaction , understand their various dilemmas and feel humbled to realize everything rings perfectly true .  this is excluding the ending , which is acceptable and all , but seems to lack the charm and spontaneity of the preceding romantic entanglements .  nonetheless , a narrowly mishandled finale certainly won't wipe the smile off your face , nor anyone else's in the audience .  `keeping the faith' is a highly enjoyable romantic comedy , although one that is more observant while surveying the questions of love rather than religion .  aww , what the hell .  the quality is not quite heaven-sent , but this little charmer could revive our `faith' in a potentially tired filmmaking genre .  |0.6|0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|"The overall sentiment of the text is positive as it praises the film ""Keeping the Faith"" for its likable characters, enjoyable romantic comedy aspect, and optimistic tone.

1|"naturally , at the core of leon gast's "" when we were kings "" is the fight itself , for what a fight it was .  thanks to the business savvy of don king , an ageing muhammad ali was pitted against the formidable hulk of heavyweight champion george foreman .  fans were treated to an 8 round battle of endurance and strategy , as much as brute strength , that immediately entered boxing lore .  with the benefit of the first-hand recollections of that old ex-pug norman mailer , this classic conflict is brought back to life .  but "" when we were kings "" tackles issues that are harder to pin down than the simple facts of a boxing match .  questions of political power and social justice appear throughout this documentary .  gast could hardly choose otherwise , considering the vocal , uncompromising politics of muhammad ali .  a member of the controversial black separatist movement the nation of islam , ali opens gast's film with a forceful swipe at the united states .  when ali hollers "" damn america' , the audience knows the imprecation is heartfelt ; the brutal yet casual way it is uttered leaves no doubt that ali is speaking his mind .  his decision to buck the draft for vietnam is defended with the same admirable fury : "" no viet cong ever called me nigger "" , ali reasons .  despite showcasing ali's proud unequivocal politics , one of the most impressive features of "" when we were kings "" is the subtle way in which the documentary considers the difficulties inherent in the overarching philosophy of black unity and black symbolism that ali and his supporters champion .  listening to the film's numerous commentators , it is clear that the geographic location for this "" rumble in the jungle "" is etched more in the imagination than anywhere you could place on a map .  spike lee tells us that the event was a pilgrimage , a "" coming home "" to africa .  foreman reminds us that africa is the "" cradle of civilisation "" .  fair enough , but this homeland is a specific nation cursed with a less than inspiring reality .  it is the newly founded zaire and it is ruled by president mobutu , a brutal dictator .  while ali respects mobutu's ability to forge an independent african state , mailer notes that beneath the stadium in which the titans battled lay hidden the presidents well-stocked torture chambers .  mailer's insights are lost on most of the film's commentators .  george plimpton recalls that he always felt he was in the congo , rather than the newly christened zaire .  with admirable restraint , gast quietly suggests that for many the grandeur of myth and history all but obscured the reality of zaire' s squalid ruling elite .  mobutu is not the only dubious character to benefit from the heady symbolism of black power .  don king , resplendent in yellow kaftan and at ease with the "" messiah "" label attributed to him by a loyal disciple , passes himself off as the voice of a new black international solidarity .  understandably , foreman believes he has gotten a raw deal .  he may be , as one sympathiser notes , "" blacker "" than ali , but he is denied the iconic status shared by ali , the thuggish mobutu , and the tacky huckster don king .  africa , zaire , inspirational leader or vicious dictator , all is left undifferentiated , unconsidered , in this optimistic celebration of black unity .  little wonder that the people of zaire were shocked to find that ali's opponent wasn't white .  admittedly , these issues are only hinted at , rather than substantially explored .  the audience must consider the significance of these issues themselves , in their own time .  there is just too much to cover , too much that is truly worthy of celebration , for a protracted political analysis to be justified .  the excitement of james brown and b . b king in concert , for instance .  and of course there's always ali to consider , as he shamelessly , and hilariously , hams it up in front of the camera , shadow boxing and uttering one inspired rhyme after another - "" we gonna get it on coz we don't get along ! "" .  doubtlessly , considering the multi-faceted nature of the extravaganza they chose to cover , the makers of "" when we were kings "" faced numerous difficulties in deciding what issues , and what personalities , best deserved their attention .  fortunately , by refusing to simplify their complex subject matter , they have captured the richness and excitement of this unique event .

1|anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia , wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes , deep , vibrant colors and an epic storyline .  it's true beauty comes from it's subtle ruminations on the politics of power , whether it's between governments , or the interplay between a man and a woman .  anna ( jodie foster ) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband .  with son in tow , she takes the employ of king mongkut ( chow yun-fat ) to tutor his son in the english language .  mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world .  anna function is to help provide that link .  the core of the film , of course , deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate .  foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide-eyed wonder .  she is assertive , yet , respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him .  it is one of foster's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career .  she brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster .  it's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut's monarchy .  when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid-film , she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance .  chow-yun fat's king mongkut is every measure of foster's anna , perhaps even more so .  this is the chow yun-fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years .  he is imposing , yet vulnerable , playful , but stern .  it is an impressively assured and nuanced performance .  precious time is stolen from the movie's 155 minutes running time by an unengaging subplot involving one the king's concubines ( bai ling ) and her love of a commoner .  it strikes with the subtlety of siam's fabled white elephant as it stomps through the leisurely paced story .  some may be put off by the action filled climax of the movie .  although a bit inconsistent in tone from the rest of the film , it fits within the established subplot of a perceived siege by neighboring burma , a country backed by the british .  anna and the king transcends being a predictable , traditional love story by avoiding mawkishness .  it shows a seduction of intelligence .  ever mindful of each other's positions , anna and king mongkut negotiate a maze of social customs , conflicting world views and lost loved ones to connect on a level that ultimately proves deeply satisfying , if not achingly bittersweet .  |0.8135833333333333|0.8666666666666667|0.8833333333333333|The general consensus is that the text has a positive sentiment, praising the movie for its beautiful visuals, epic storyline, and strong performances by Jodie Foster and Chow Yun-fat.

1|"scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well .  during a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals .  a few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one .   .   .  scream 2 !  1996's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america !  a sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment .  in fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film !  sidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater .  meanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled "" stab "" , which has been developed into a major motion picture .  as scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of "" stab "" , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria .  this marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown "" copycat "" sets out to repeat what's been done .   .   .  and finish what hasn't !  of course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies .  this is in large part due to williamson's deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied .  as much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you're not bound to complain .  i will note , however , that the "" whodunit ? ""  did wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie .  all the actors outdo themselves here .  we're not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing .  the characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years .  we can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don't lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place .  the nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn't seem off-kilter from it's predecessor .  it's a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film .  we skip two years , but there doesn't seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks .  it flows so well that you feel more like you're reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? )  than just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces .  while main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2's entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption .  as i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it's precursor .  the only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first .  this doesn't mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it's sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it's own while maintaining it's sought-after qualities .  if ever a film followed it's original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there .  scream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks .  it would top off the series quite well , if it weren't for the fact that two movies don't really make a series .  it's unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won't appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let's hope they can keep up the fantastic work .  like they say , don't mess with perfection .   .   .  but when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who's gonna listen ?

1|"devotees of robert a . heinlein , be forewarned : paul verhoeven's starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein's novel than it is a literary satire .  the author's jingo-all-the-way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless , faceless parade of carnage from the film version .  and i suppose that's exactly what verhoeven delivers , with sometimes hilarious results .  heinlein's basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement , while their strengths become the stuff of high-energy entertainment .  outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor , since it's basically a big bug hunt . . . aliens in broad daylight .  sometime in the future , humanity is threatened by giant , malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty-foot-tall action figures ( arachnids with super-impaling spikes , beetles that spew forth lava , dragonflies with guillotine legs ) .  among those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires : conflicted rich kid johnny rico ( casper van dien ) ; his math whiz girlfriend carmen ( denise richards ) ; dizzy ( dina meyer ) , who secretly carries a torch for johnny ; and carl ( neil patrick "" doogie howser "" harris ) , who not-so-secretly carries a torch for dizzy , and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets .  while carmen heads for flight school and carl joins military intelligence , johnny and dizzy become mobile infantry , their various battles intertwining with romantic sub-plots out of a third season episode from "" beverly hills 90210 . ""  so if starship troopers is another movie where one-dimensional characters wade through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of aliens , what makes it any better than , say , independence day , a movie where one-dimensional characters waded through trite situations on their way to killing a bunch of slightly different aliens ?  for one thing , you sense that the film-makers are aware of the pulp nonsense they have as source material .  the very absence of major stars in the cast feels thematically appropriate , not just fiscally prudent .  if starship troopers had been turned into a tv-movie , aaron spelling would have produced it .  it's a story which requires emoting , not acting ; it's a prime time soap opera with big guns , played for all the dopey melodrama it's worth .  the no-name cast also plays into verhoeven's treatment of heinlein's most controversial conceit .  in this society , we learn , one can only be a full citizen after completing some sort of federal service , military for most .  verhoeven pays the notion plenty of lip service , then proceeds to skewer it with brilliant mock recruitment ads ( named after the world war ii-era "" why we fight "" series ) in which youngsters are indoctrinated into the joys of firearms , or the pleasures of stomping cockroaches .  these characters really are just "" fresh meat for the grinder , "" as one character puts it , which makes their lack of familiarity all the more fitting .  it's not that starship troopers is anti-military , because it never treats the true horror of war as anything but a great big , violent video game .  in fact , the characters are living the propaganda ( particularly johnny , who receives so many field promotions he may not remember his own rank by the time the film ends ) .  verhoeven is actually having it both ways -- he's making fun of gung-ho boosterism even as he fires his fresh-faced recruits into battle on a gung-ho booster rocket of visual effects .  if that makes starship troopers hypocritical , at least it's enthusiastically staged hypocrisy .  there may not be a person worth caring about in the whole film , but it moves like nobody's business .  verhoeven stages some thrilling action sequences , sending swarms of bugs after the anonymous grunts then having various body parts strewn about the screen like landscaping .  it is that rare special effects blockbuster which demonstrates a sense of pacing to match its budget ; i was caught up in the action enough of the time that i wasn't perpetually groaning over the absence of real human beings .  i wish i could find it in myself to work up more outrage over the callous way humans are dispatched in starship troopers , but it didn't work out that way .  that would be punishing verhoeven for getting to the heart of his material .

1|"film adaptation of hunter s . thompson's infamous semi-autobiographical hallucinogen-fueled book of the same title .  director terry gilliam of twelve monkeys ( 8/10 ) and brazil ( 7/10 ) fame , took over the helm of this project after fellow director alex cox ( sid and nancy ( 7 . 5/10 ) )   "" apparently alienated everyone associated with the movie "" , according to gilliam .  plot : writer thompson ( depp ) heads down to las vegas with his attorney dr . gonzo ( del toro ) to cover a motorcycle race .  during their trip , they systematically consume "" two bags of grass , seventy-five pellets of mescaline , five sheets of high powered blotter acid , a salt shaker half-full of cocaine , a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers , downers , screamers , laughers , a quart of tequila , a quart of rum , a case of beer , a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls .  the movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use .  critique : i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer's own mind , whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess .  if you are prepared to get high or intoxicated before watching this film , i would say that this is one picture that you will thoroughly enjoy on a multitude of colorful levels .  if , on the other hand , you decide to stray from the addition of nefarious elements to your system , i could not imagine you truly appreciating much of this drug-induced picture's entire ride ( 5 . 5/10 for all those sober dogs ) .  note : i have not read thompson's book .  having said that , joblo did engage in an alcohol-based consumatory session before ( and during ) the viewing of this film , so his critique of the film should be appreciated on that level .  this movie relies heavily on style and peculiar humour , rather than substance or plot .  it moves admirably from one scene to the next , without much basis of their being , while presenting us with the two days in the life of writer hunter s . thompson during which he seemed to consume more drugs and alcohol than anyone could ever imagine .  it was 1971 , and the times were apparently "" a' changing "" in the states .  johnny depp chews into his role like an overgrown child sucking on a chocolate lollipop .  during the filming , depp apparently become fast friends with real-life writer thompson , and was known to wander off the set from time to time , for the sake of checking out the newest barmaid at the local watering hole .  i thought he did seem to exaggerate his walk a little bit too much , but then again , this movie is supposed to be a wild exaggeration of everything and anything , so who am i to talk .  the one thing that did blow my mind was the actual physical transformation endured by actor benicio del toro for his role as dr . gonzo .  i couldn't believe that this fat , samoan lawyer , was the same guy who played the slick mumbling criminal in the usual suspects ( 7 . 5/10 ) .  word on the street is that gained over 40 pounds for this role , and i must say that his look was deliciously reprehensible .  plenty of cameos also pepper this kaleidoscopic moving picture in the form of ellen barkin , christina ricci , tobey maguire and cameron diaz , along with a bunch of others .  other than that , the soundtrack was expectedly eclectic , the style was not as wild as i thought it would be , and the ending was certainly not much of a barn-burner , but then again , who really noticed .  this movie is about visions of bats floating through your head , johnny depp looking goofy and being bald , and the cornucopia of drug-ravaged scenes filling your own intoxicated system with ideas of anarchy , rebellion and the lost american dream .  and for all those who plan on seeing this movie without the partnership of a mean drink or a mighty doobie , i suggest you move further down the aisle , buy yourself a ticket to godzilla ( 6/10 ) , and enjoy the visual fabrications manufactured for the unstimulated mind .  little known facts : depp and del toro snorted plenty of powdered milk instead of cocaine .  bill murray also portrayed a thompson-based character in the film where the buffalo roam .  johnny depp turned down roles in the three musketeers , speed ( 7 . 5/10 ) , and legends of the fall ( 7 . 5/10 ) , for smaller and quirkier roles in benny and joon ( 6 . 5/10 ) and what's eating gilbert grape ?

1|"what is freedom ?  how does one determine who is free ?  in 1839 , those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now .  yet , the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations .  that is , in essence , what steven spielberg's gripping drama "" amistad "" is about .  through its various dramas , spielberg presents a case about a group of africans , who , after being seized from their home , were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard "" la amistad "" .  on their way there , the slaves , led by cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , rebelled , killing off part of the crew .  however , the ship was still directed towards the united states , where the africans were brought to trial under murder .  in the court , various factions claim ownership of the slaves , and therefore try to seize them away .  the united states government , led by president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , and secretary of state secretary forsyth ( david paymer ) , try to ship the africans to spain , where an 11 year old isabella ii ( anna paquin ) wants them back .  the two spaniards who own "" la amistad "" want the slaves for themselves .  the american ship that found the slaves also wants them .  in the midst of this are two abolitionists ( stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman ) , who want the slaves to be free .  they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey , who tries to free them .  through various legal proceedings , the case appears before the supreme court , where it is argued by ex-president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) .  the film itself is a visual wonder .  spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark , somber mood when appropriate , and a visual setting when appropriate as well .  at times , the film is very slow , and very methodical .  however , spielberg is not at his finest here , because the courtroom scenes have a tendency to lag .  the film is , in essence , a courtroom drama , one whose events are oversimplified .  the characterization is also weak , displaying weaknesses in building up characters such as the lawyer baldwin ( mcconaughey ) , and especially morgan freeman's abolitionist .  but spielberg's finest work in the film , the opening scene , a scene of cinque's family , and the brutal voyage of the slaves to america , is altogether stunning .  it is this emotional force that carries the film .  mcconaughey is superb as the lawyer defending the africans , hopkins is sensational as the old adams , freeman is outstanding when used ( spielberg vastly under uses his supreme talents ) , and the rest of the cast is stellar .  the movie , however , belongs to hounsou .  his emotional intensity is brilliant .  spielberg manages to make even the slowest scenes sparkle with focus on hounsou , and the film's extraordinary power is simply captivating .  the film is flawed , for most of the supporting characters are merely cardboard .  but that doesn't matter .  the story is a gripping one , and one of extreme importance .  kudos to spielberg for finding it , finding the right men for the job , and letting the audience listen to the words of cinque .  a good job all around .

1|"i remember seeing the trailer of the black cauldron on the pinocchio video .  it really scared me , and i didn't want to go see it .  however , after i heard about how wonderful it was , i wanted to see it .  i didn't get a chance to do so , until now .  the film , disney's 25th animated feature , opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale : a long time ago in the land of prydain , there was a king so evil , that his spirit was captured in the cauldron .  it has been hidden for centuries , and whoever possesses it will have the power to conjure up an army of deathless warriors , and with them rule the world ? and destroy it .  then , we meet a farmer-wizard , dallben , and his young apprentice , taran .  taran dreams of being a warrior instead of being a `pig-keeper' ( they have a pig named hen-wen ) .  one day , as he gives hen wen a nice warm bath , the pig goes crazy , and dallben then realizes , after watching hen wen's thoughts through a bucket of water , that taran must hide hen wen in the forest .  an evil ruler known as the horned king is searching for the black cauldron , and only hen wen has the power to show its location .  taran leads hen wen into the forest , but of course , he loses her , and tries to go find her .  along the way , he meets up with a mischievous little creature named gurgi , who desires `munchings and crunchings' , much to his dismay ( besides , he stole an apple that taran was trying to use to bring back hen wen ) .  when he hears hen wen's squeal from far away , though , he races to her rescue ? only to see her get kidnapped by dragonlike gwythants .  taran chases after the gwythants and finds himself staring at the horned king's castle from far away .  taran climbs the castle walls , and brings himself into the castle , where he attempts to rescue hen wen .  he manages to do so , but he is himself captured and thrown into the dungeon .  there , he meets princess eilonwy ( and her magic bauble , another thing which the horned king was hoping to use to find the cauldron ) , and the two escape through the deep castle walls .  along the way , taran finds a sword in a burial chamber , and they rescue a comic bard named fflewdurr flamm , who has a harp whose strings break whenever he tells a lie .  the three manage to escape the horned king's castle , but not before taran realizes that his sword is magic .  as they rest in the forest , gurgi reappears , claiming to have found hen wen's trail .  he leads taran , eilonwy and fflewdurr , by way of `pig tracks' , to a whirlpool .  suddenly , they all get sucked under , and they meet the fairy-like fairfolk .  taran is reunited with hen wen , and informed that the black cauldron is hidden in the land of morva .  he then devises a crazy idea that if they can destroy the cauldron , it would prevent the horned king from destroying their world .  with the help of a grumpy fairy named doli , the four travelers manage to find themselves at a mysterious cottage .  it turns out to be no ordinary cottage ; three comically strange witches inhabit the place .  when taran tells them that they are searching for the black cauldron , they agree to let him have it ? in exchange for his sword .  taran agrees , much to eilonwy's horror , but at least they get the black cauldron .  but ? the cauldron can't be destroyed , only its evil powers can be stopped .  the only way to do so is for a living being to climb into it of his own free will ? never to return alive .  things take a turn for the worse when the horned king's henchmen capture taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr , along with the black cauldron , and lead them back to the castle .  taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr watch in horror as the horned king unleashes the supernatural powers of the cauldron to ressurect his army of deathless warriors ( this is the most horrifying scene in the film , because here , a dead army comes alive ? ) .  just when all seems lost , though , gurgi reappears , and rescues taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr .  taran is about to jump into the black cauldron , but gurgi stops him , not wanting him to throw his life away .  gurgi then jumps into the black cauldron , and the deathless warriors decay .  taran tries to find a way to rescue gurgi , but he is forced to do battle against the horned king .  he kicks the horned king away , who is then magically sucked into the black cauldron , where its powers immediately destroy him completely .  taran , eilonwy , and fflewdurr manage to escape from the horned king's castle just as it self-destructs .  the witches then reappear and attempt to take the now useless black cauldron away , but fflewdurr stops them , saying that they `never give anything away , they bargain' .  in response to this , the witches offer taran his sword back , but taran instead has a new trade : the cauldron for gurgi .  the trade is made ; gurgi's seemingly lifeless body reappears before the heartbroken group .  as taran cradles him in his arms , though , gurgi stirs-he is not dead after all !  the happy group then returns home , where hen wen ( brought home by the fairfolk once the dangers are past ) , dallben , and even doli , await their triumphant return .  as spectacular as it sounds , the black cauldron really suffered a lot in its past times .  before ron miller was fired from his position as chairman of walt disney productions , he had bought a novel by lloyd alexander called the black cauldron , a sword and sorcery tale for the studio .  bringing this book to the screen was the studio's fondest dream .  miller , who entitled himself as the executive producer , promised that they would do so after they had proved themselves on other projects .  when micheal eisner and his executives arrived at the disney animation studio , the animators were struggling to complete the black cauldron .  by this time , things had gone really rocky for the animation department .  many of the studio's old men had retired or died .  therefore , the animators suffered a hard time making this film .  originally budgeted at $25 million , the costs raised to $40 million because of constant changes on everything ? and when it was finally released on june 24 , 1985 , the black cauldron was greeted by praising reviews from some critics , but somehow the film flopped .  the film was rated pg and the film , although `disneyfied' from lloyd alexander's chronicles of prydain ( which is what this film is based on ) , was much more scarier and darker than disney's other previous efforts , such as the rescuers and the fox and the hound , which is probably why so many people considered it too scary and stayed away from it .  in addition , other critics rejected it for having `no heart' and `unmemorable' , compared to other disney animated features .  but whatever the real reason , the black cauldron was a financial disaster , grossing only $21 million .  the failure of the film grounded the studio's animation department , and exiled the animation team to annex buildings in nearby glendale , and it seemed like animated features would no longer become a part of the studio's reputation .  the next two disney animated features , the great mouse detective and oliver and company , although a little more lighthearted than the black cauldron , didn't do much better ( although oliver and company grossed much more than the black cauldron and the great mouse detective ) .  only with the little mermaid did the studio regain its reputation for successful animated features .  as for the black cauldron , it was rereleased in some cities for a temporary time under the title taran and the magic cauldron .  finally , the studio locked the film in the film vault and denied that it ever even was released .  because of all this , you might ask yourself , was the black cauldron really such a bad movie ?  the people who had seen the film didn't think so .  in fact , many people had calls to buena vista home video requesting for the film , but of course , they denied it .  for a while , it seemed like the black cauldron would never be released to video ? until september 1997 , disney released the black cauldron to video in the united kingdom .  few people imported the video from england and converted to ntsc ( including me ) and for those who hadn't seen the film yet ( i am included here ) , they got quite a treat .  but people who had bootleg copies of the black cauldron noticed that in the scene where the horned king raises his army of deathless warriors , about 12 seconds of ghoulish looking skeletons were slightly trimmed so that the film would get a u rating ( in the uk , the u rating means universal : suitable for all ages , kinda like their own version of g ) .  somewhere online , a team of diehard the black cauldron fans signed a petition that said , `bring back the black cauldron ! ' , and because of that , disney finally decided to release the video to the united states .  before that time , rumors online had been made that the video would be trimmed , like the uk video , so that it would get a g rating , and that they would add in songs .  those rumors were put to rest when the walt disney company announced that the black cauldron * would * be released in its pg rated version .  even still , when it was finally released to the us , some reaction was mixed .  some felt that it was indeed cut , but some felt that it wasn't .  but these where only minor criticisms which seemed laughable , since a film that was absent for thirteen years was finally available .  as for myself , when i saw the movie for the first time ( on converted ntsc video ) , i didn't expect much at all .  in fact , i had heard so many mediocre things about it , that i didn't think the film would ever be such a good film .  much to my surprise , when i saw the first few minutes of the film , i was asking myself , "" this is the same film everyone saw ?  the one that flopped at the box office ?  the one that critics and filmgoers alike called "" a bad movie "" ?  this doesn't seem like all of the above .  instead , it's a classic in its own right .  the film has a wonderful cast of characters .  there's taran ( grant bardsley ) , an assistant pig keeper who would rather be a warrior than a pig-keeper , the story's hero .  the critics have said that taran is not likeable at all , but the opposite is true .  he is brave , loyal , and eventually learns a lesson about friendship later on .  there's a likeable character here !  not that he's the only likeable character in the film .  there's gurgi ( john biner ) , a lovable little , uh , thing who remains loyal to taran , even though they don't quite hit it off at first .  but another likeable character is the bad guy comic henchman , a dwarf named creeper ( phil fondacairo ) , who is loyal to the film's imaginative and sinister villain , the horned king ( voiced gruesomely by john hurt ) , yet he also fears his neck .  the other characters , including the sidekicks , a spunky , but sweet princess named eilonwy and the comic bard fflewdurr flamm , and three comically wicked witches who hide a dark secret , although pleasant and likeable , aren't quite as well rounded as they should be .  the story itself is an adventurous one , a quest involving the mystical pig , hen wen , the black cauldron itself , and an army of deathless ones with everything : a hooking opening to a spectacular finale .  elmer bernstein's music also tells the story perfectly , in a dark , yet calming manner .  the animation itself is surprisingly good considering that this film was created in the darkest time of the studios .  even though there are some occasional effects that are not quite good , like the ground opening when the black cauldron rises out of the earth , the animation overall is top notch .  overall ? this film is an entertaining endeavor .  fans unfamiliar to the lloyd alexander chronicles of prydain will get a kick out of this one , except young kids .  there are some extremely scary scenes which are more darker than disney's other films ( although some consider the stampede sequence from the lion king and frollo observing esmeralda in the fires of hell in the hunchback of notre dame are just as scary ) , which is the main reason why this film is rated pg .  fans familiar to the lloyd alexander series will recognize the differences between the novel and the movie .  even though it doesn't have all of the ingredients of a true disney film , this film is a classic in its own right , and deserves a far better chance than what it has been given .  that better chance has finally come .  whatever reason about why the black cauldron was such a big failure seems to have disappeared , and the film has finally achieved its place among disney's most proudest achievements .  i can't help but think though , whatever would have happened if the black cauldron * was * a box office success ?

1|"is jimmy stewart the greatest actor of all-time ?  it's quite possible .  his career spanned over 40 years , and he acted in more movies than most actors ever could .  yet , when he is talked about in the media , he is generally thought of as an actor who played one type of role : the nice guy .  and that's really a shame .

1|every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections .  such is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life .  despite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film .  you probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick .  will hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m . i . t . , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it .  he likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working-class buddies and drink beer .  he ? s good-looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk .  after getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor .  after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once-promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems .  in the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love .  the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film .  even though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character .  alas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it .  the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character .  is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ?  of course .  is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ?  usually , yes .  but , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city-street tough ?  not very likely .  come on , usually these guys are total nerds who can ? t even buy their own shirts , much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med . -school  girls .  will is just a little too perfect , and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition .  the heavy-handed , anti-war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish , overlong , pompous , and completely unnecessary .  all this sounds pretty bad , but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways .  damon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable , his performance is truly extraordinary .  which leads me to the really good part of the review .  the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting .  i can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well-acted from top to bottom .  from minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid-back best friend , and all the small roles in between , the performances are magnificent .  robin williams ? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ? ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line .  the real gem though is stellan skarsg ? rd ? s turn as professor lambeau , an award-winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger , smarter will hunting .  the scenes between williams and skarsg ? rd , as two old college pals who ? ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid , display some of the best acting i ? ve ever seen .  when i say delivering the goods , this is what i ? m talking about .  watching these two work is what going to see movies is all about .  gus van sant ? s ( to die for , drugstore cowboy ) cold , urban direction is right on , as well as danny elfman ? s sauntering musical score .  i highly recommend ? good will hunting ? .  despite its faults , it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year .  |0.7000000000000001|0.8833333333333334|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive, as the reviewer praises the effective delivery and exceptional acting performances in the film ""Good Will Hunting.""

1|"men in black is an explosive mix of science fiction , action , and comedy that hits the target in every possible way .  although another alien movie , men in black succeeds in every way that independence day didn't , and towers above many other movies of its type .  the brilliant acting , especially by tommy lee jones as agent kay , is also as good as it gets .  director barry sonnenfeld , who was behind the camera for the addams family movies and get shorty , has crafted a masterpiece .  the story behind men in black is just as interesting as you would want it to be .  the men in black , or mib , are a top-secret governmental agency that is not known to exist .  the mib are responsible for "" saving the world from the scum of the universe "" .  a though job , indeed .  the film opens with a truckload of illegal aliens ( the human kind ) being transported across the mexico border and into the united states .  presumably , these "" aliens "" are all migrant workers .  that is , until the mib show up and begin interrogating them .  agent kay selects a particular suspicious worker and takes him away from the other local authorities to discover that he is not an illegal human alien , but a real extra-terrestrial alien .  when the alien makes a run for it , agent kay is forced to eliminate the alien with one of the mib's very unique weapons , and after one of the local law enforcement officers witnesses this bizarre occurrence , agent kay is forced to use another very unique device on them .  the device , described as "" out of state "" , eliminates the memory of anyone it is used on .  >from here , we are introduced to james edwards , played very well by will smith .  edwards , a police officer , is chasing a fleeing criminal .  the criminal gives a very good chase , and at one point when edwards confronts him , the criminal pulls out a very different looking weapon that disintegrated when it hit the ground .  edwards continues to chase the very athletic criminal to the top of a building , where the criminal informs edwards that he must let him go , because someone is after him .  edwards doesn't take this seriously , but when the criminal shows very non-human characteristics and leaps off the building , he begins to wonder .  back at the police station , agent kay shows up to ask edwards a few questions .  he informs edwards that is was , in fact , a non-human that he was chasing , and that the gun he pulled out was definitely not man-made .  he has edwards identify the gun , and asks edwards to come to the mib headquarters the following day .  edwards arrives and finds that he is involved in a recruiting process , along with various other men who seem a bit more qualified than he .  after goofing up for half of the time , edwards puts on a show at the firing range , and agent kay notes the reason why he feels edwards should be the man to join the mib : he chased down the "" criminal "" on foot , which is something that no one is supposed to be able to do .  in the meantime , an upstate new york farm has a very close encounter .  edgar ( vincent d'onofrio ) , owner of the farm , investigates a strange crash landing and is attacked by the inhabitant of the flying object , which presumes to jump inside edgar and use his body as a human transport .  the "" bug "" , as he is called , is an intergalactic terrorist who has come to earth to attempt to kill two ambassadors .  and it up to the mib , with newly recruited agent jay ( formerly james edwards ) to exterminate the bug and save the planet from intergalactic war .  men in black delightfully combines fast-paced action with often hilarious comedy , which is usually from will smith , although tommy lee jones opens up his comedic personality in this film .  the special effects are also very well done and are not the entire source of the plot , as in another big alien film from the past summer .  screenwriter ed solomon , writer of super mario bros .  and the upcoming x-men film , has surely struck gold with this story .  all ages will enjoy men in black .  it is an extremely fun film that you will want to see again .  although it runs a very quick and speedy 96 minutes , the entire film from beginning to end is a non-stop adventure .  the ending of the film , which ties up a few loose ends for one of the main characters , is also very well done .  a sequel is already being planned , so there is more to look forward to !

1|"ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances .  for his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women ) .  despite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences .  the film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england .  as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback .  meanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest .  lucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology .  lucinda is rich ; oscar is poor .  lucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself .  yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it's on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin .  and fate has decreed that they will one day meet .  that day doesn't occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help .  another of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory .  at first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn't take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other .  a friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent .  but oscar is uncertain of lucinda's affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her .  oscar and lucinda isn't beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions .  on more than one occasion , it's apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route .  coincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can't go anywhere .  the voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments .   ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . )  yet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda .  storyline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters .  thematically , the film is also strong .  the unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated .  oscar and lucinda don't just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls .  a card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional "" strip poker "" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion .  oscar does not see gambling as a vice .  in fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one's immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith .  ralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar .  the actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen .  as good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett .  the actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford's paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda .  she gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles .  effective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen's persuasion ) as lucinda's close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar's mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer .  there's a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence .   ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . )  with the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package .  the characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett .  so who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ?  oscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer .

1|"in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly-overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us .  president john kennedy ( bruce greenwood ) and his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson's dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in "" thirteen days . ""  one of the highlights to come out of made-for-tv movies was a 1974 entry called "" missiles of october "" that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us , ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown .  that teleplay , starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby , showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962 .  now , a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie , director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again ( the last time was for the taught spy thriller "" no way out "" ) to re-enact the events of that most dangerous time in america's and the world's history .  taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p . o'donnell ( costner ) , donaldson and crew recreate that volatile event , once again , as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war .  as o'donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning , he deals with the usual family crises and problems .  meanwhile , a u2 spy plane photo mission over cuba has produced some startling images - medium range nuclear missiles in the first stage of deployment .  suddenly , ken's routine day switches into crisis mode as the president and his key advisor bobby begin to muster the considerable forces of the us military to face the soviet threat .  where "" thirteen days "" differs most from "" missiles of october "" is , as expected , in the scope of the project .  there is a big difference , budget-wise , between making a television docudrama and one that goes to the big screen .  it shows as the makers of "" thirteen days "" craft a recreation of the cuban missile crisis that encompasses not only the political intrigue within the white house , it also depicts the events that took place as america girds itself for nuclear confrontation .  the cast , a true ensemble , is led , surprisingly , by bruce greenwood as jfk and not by kevin costner .  costner's o'donnell represents the family guy thing as the drama of the crisis has its impact on him and his family .  this puts a personal spin on the film as we see both the crisis and america's preparation for war and the pressure it brings to bear on those in the know .  kenny reassures his wife and kids that all will be okay and they will be safe , but he knows that , if the crisis comes to a head , his family will be no more .  the meat of "" thirteen days "" is in the big picture , not the microcosm of family , though .  this is where the film stands out as we see the workings of our government on the highest levels .  the story does not just cover the face-off between the world's two most powerful countries ; it also depicts the animosity between the president and the military/cia .  the disaster of the bay of pigs invasion the year before left a distrustful taste in the mouths of the generals and admirals who blame the kennedys for not backing the cuban expatriates fighting fidel castro .  the missile crisis becomes a struggle for power as the army/navy/air force want to flex their might and invade cuba , while jfk wants to end the confrontation peaceably but with america's dignity and world leadership intact .  while the internal battle for power rages in the white house , with air force chief curtis lemay ( kevin conway ) advising the president to bomb cuba into the stone age , our armed forces are set into motion to stop the soviets with a blockade of offensive weapons to cuba .  this is where the political intrigues of high office are replaced by exciting action .  when the first confrontation takes place between a us warship and a soviet freighter , the tension is palpable .  the most involving action sequence takes place late in the game as another u2 is sent up to shoot some snaps of the buildup and the fully prepared soviet forces launch an anti-aircraft attack on the hapless pilot of the spy plane .  this is a sweaty palm sequence to say the least , making you squirm in your seat as you try to help the pilot avoid those missiles .  the ensemble cast places greenwood as the first among equals with like weight given to all the principle players .  greenwood does not play act at being a caricature of jfk , foregoing the typical kennedy boston accent .  instead , he plays the man as a powerful figure who has to maintain the dignity of the office , directing his subordinates but giving them the latitude to make clear all of his options .  kennedy used this decision by committee method to good effect as his senior staff uncovers all the options available to the president .  costner , as ken o'donnell , is really a supporting cast member as a kennedy crony brought on board as a personal political favor .  costner plays o'donnell as if he crammed on old jfk speeches with a forced kennedyesque twang to his speech .  the rest of the players are first rate from start to finish with steven culp looking and sounding just like robert kennedy .  the rest of the familiar players in this drama are uniformly well cast , too .  standing out are michael fairman as the beleaguered us ambassador to the un , adlai stevenson , who was forced to become the challenging voice of the united states in the united nations and i remember the confrontation vividly .  the filmmakers capture the accusations laid down by stevenson with accuracy , using old style video footage to good effect .  dylan baker has the look and feel of the intelligentsia as the brainy secretary of defense robert mcnamara .  kevin conway gives his general lemay the right "" bomb them to hell "" attitude .  also notable is christopher lawford as navy pilot william ecker who , with his wingman , takes on the dangerous mission of a low-level photo recon into the heart of cuba , bravely challenging kenny o'donnell's admonition , "" don' get shot . ""  tech credits are superb across the board with an admirable depiction of the us armed forces being placed on a war footing .  it's an impressive production with the careful use of period aircraft and ships that gives the film a veracity fitting the event .  solid costuming by isis mussenden is subtle but has the look of the kennedys .  there is the usual array of vintage cars from the period to make things look right .  the special f/x of the u2 sequences are a nice crafting of computer imaging .  the cuban missile crisis is probably the most intense two weeks that the united states has ever faced in its survival as a world leader .  helmer donaldson and his fine crew and cast have given the depiction of this crucial event with the care and attention to details that make this one of the finest docudramas of the year .  i give "" thirteen days "" an a- .

1|"true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it .  even the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms .  so it's not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get "" the apostle "" onto the big-screen .  as a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money .  he also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss "" sonny "" dewey .  few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it's testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall .  and , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion .  sonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve .  he spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals .  unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film's purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church .  duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses .  one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher .  faced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper .  at his son's baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife's lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal .  not knowing what else to do , sonny disappears .  he throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again .  in the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling .  after befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town's ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple .  re-christening himself as "" the apostle e . f . , "" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other's lives .  but , always , sonny's past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress .  duvall has made his intentions in making "" the apostle "" clear .  in a recent article in "" newsweek , "" he wrote : "" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers . . .  but what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way . ""  the strength of duvall's convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - "" the apostle "" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he's being sincere with the subject matter .  after fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual .  his sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to .   "" i've always called you jesus and you've always called me sonny , "" he says .  when neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny's mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there's no sense trying to interrupt him .  the main theme to emerge from "" the apostle "" is the fact that good can come from any situation .  sonny's act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact .  however , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him .  in his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him .  and , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment .  it is that strength in sonny's character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws .  weak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves .  watching duvall on-screen , it's not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting .  as sonny , he completely inhabits the character , and his performance is certainly the best of the year .  because he spent so much time absorbing the traits , methods , quirks , and personalities of real preachers , duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human .  as a director , duvall feels that less is more .  his camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it , with very little intrusion .  there are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close-ups .  duvall knew that the power of the film's characters ( enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non-professional churchgoers and actual ministers ) didn't need to be artificially enhanced .  in this way , "" the apostle "" almost plays out like a documentary , not only in its technical simplicity , but more importantly , in its sense of reality .

1|"when a someone journeys to the theater to see a comedy , he always risks having to sit through inanity such as what we recently saw in films like edtv and office space .  it really is too bad that comedies are so hit- and-miss , because when a moviegoer goes in a theater expecting to be amused , it really is a shame when the alleged comedy fails to deliver .  but weep not , dear readers , because the latest comedy out of the hollywood movie mill is nothing less than a sure bet .  austin powers : the spy who shagged me is one of the funniest things i've had the pleasure to see in a long time ; a completely looney , delightful parody of the often pretentious james bond flicks .  if all comedies ( or even half ; or - - what am i saying ?  -- even a fifth of them ) could be this consistently hysterical , i would take up residence at my local multiplex .  even more to this movie's credit is the fact that it is a sequel to the 1997 sleeper/cult hit austin powers : international man of mystery .  the original came out of nowhere ; it was a low-budget , eccentric movie that many expected to flop like a leslie nielsen parody .  all of a sudden it was being quoted by teenagers all over america .  ironically , powers' "" yeeeeah baby , yeah ! ""  has almost become an icon of the late 90s .  thus another installment was inevitable , but it's also undoubtedly welcome .  the spy who shagged me is one of the most unrestrained , over- the-top comedies i have ever seen in my entire life .  it brings back most of the characters from its predecessor ( even if only briefly ) and adds new ones .  austin powers ( mike myers ) , a swinging hipster from the 60s transported into the 90s has to go back to his own time to get back his mojo ( oh , you'll figure it out ) , which dr . evil ( meyers again ) has stolen .  he enlists the help of a gorgeous secret agent felicity shagwell ( now that his prior sidekick vanessa has been properly disposed of in a hilarious opening sequence ) , played without much distinguishable gusto by heather graham and together they go back to the 60s to defeat dr . evil yet again .  surprisingly , the real star is dr . evil rather than austin .  he gets most of the screen time because he was so popular in the first movie .  perhaps this is true because he is portrayed and written so affectionately .  instead of being the scheming , villainous mad scientist we might expect from a character like this he is a bumbling , often sweet mad scientist wannabe .  the spy who shagged me has much of the same stuff we saw in the original , but that's okay by me because the original left us wanting more .  by the time that one was over we haven't had nearly our share of shag jokes , crude puns and powers' antics and this sequel satisfies our appetites .  even by its conclusions , i'm still not sure i've had my fill of bits like "" do you smoke after sex ? ""   "" i don't know , baby , i never looked . ""  this may seem awfully immature of me , but understand that the austin powers series , unlike most of the crap hollywood feeds us these days , is genuinely funny .  i don't know if i've ever laughed harder at any movie than i did during the jerry springer send up or the indubitably hilarious "" just the two of us "" rendition by dr . evil and his new miniature clone named "" mini-me "" .  i don't have any pretensions that this is particularly smart social satire or anything of the sort .  indeed there is little beyond the joy a viewer feels when he sees something that is able to entertain him as much as this movie did .  but as far as i'm concerned , that is enough .   ? 1999 eugene novikov &#137 ;  "|0.8563636666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.8833333333333333|"The user's explanations all indicate positive sentiment towards the movie ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"", highlighting its humor, entertainment value, and the author's enjoyment of it as one of the funniest movies they have seen in a long time."
1|"almost a full decade before steven spielberg's saving private ryan asked whether a film could be both "" anti war "" and "" pro-soldier "" , john irvin's hamburger hill proved it could .  lost in the inundation of critical acclaim that greeted oliver stone's platoon , this excellent film was dismissed as "" too militaristic "" .  it's hard to understand exactly why---unless irvin , in assembling his motley collection of young men who for predictable ( and often naive ) reasons "" chose to show up "" for the vietnam debacle , ---has refused to present us with the stone killer , drug-stoked psycho and ruthless opportunist who have become to vietnam war epics what "" the polack , the hillbilly and the kid from brooklyn "" became to wwii movies .  hamburger hill , based on a true story , is not an easy film to watch .  there is a scene that will have graying anti-war activists squirming in their seats , or moved to genuine tears .  and the climactic final assault on the "" hill "" in question is visually confusing .  gristly realities are presented in brief flashes , as if the brain dared not acknowledged what it had encountered .  and in the mud and smoke officer and enlistee , veteran and "" newbie "" , black soldier and white , become almost indistinguishable from each other , as they do in the chaos of actual combat .  the acting throughout is solid with an absolutely stellar performance rendered by courtney b . vance as doc--in a role that will have many flatly disbelieving that this is same actor they cheered as "" seaman jones "" in mctiernan's red october .  if you've seen private ryan , you owe it to yourself to see hamburger hill--if only to determine that the all the valour and horror of spielberg's vision was as present in the ashau valley as it was at omaha beach .
