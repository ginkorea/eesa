1|as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens , i have some idea of how ellie aroway ( jodie foster ) feels .  but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers , i can't say that i do exactly .  her reason is that she needs solid proof : there is no proof that god existed , so therefor she does not believe .  ellie also believes in aliens , and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist .  how can she say she doesn't believe in god because of the lack of proof , and then say she believes in aliens , which are gereally less believed in than god without sounding like a hypocrite ?  that's the catch-22 .  when aliens from the star vega fax her some plans for a device to transport someone to them ( okay , well , they didn't really * fax * them . . . )  ellie wants to be the one to go , but because of her atheism she is denied the position .  how dumb is that ?  she discovers the transmitions , then she isn't allowed to go .  well , because of a bomb and a psychopath ( jake busey ) , she * does * end up going , but not in the way that we would've thought .  contact is based on a novel by carl sagan , who died during the filmmaking .  it is the best alien movie since close encounters of the 3rd kind , and will end up being the best film of the year .  its views of science and religion will no doubt aggrivate some , but will stimulate more .  i'm glad at least one movie of the '90s can portray aliens in a psitive light , rather than a bunch of slimey beasts who will eat your insides and then put on your body .  |0.30000000000000004|0.8333333333333334|0.7666666666666666|The explanations indicate a mixed sentiment towards the text, with both positive and negative aspects highlighted.

1|"by now i figured i'd seen every alfred hitchcock film at least a half-dozen times -- not that i'm complaining .  to call him the "" master of suspense "" is an understatement .  the paradine case ( 1947 ) , admittedly one of hitchcock's lesser movies , turned out to be one i'd missed .  this one , like all hitchcock films , is well worth savoring .  the story opens with the rich mrs . maddalena anna paradine being arrested in her home for poisoning her blind husband .  as mrs . paradine , alida valli plays an aloof but alluring woman of the world .  to franz waxman's stark and moody music , we see the prison guards divesting her of her luxurious garments and jewels .  stripped of her fine raiment , she becomes a commoner again , which , as it turns out , was what she was before she met her husband .   "" a brief skirmish , and you'll be lunching at the savoy again , "" anthony keane , her ultraconfident attorney tells her in their first meeting , predicting a fast and easy trial .  gregory peck plays the successful and debonair barrister .   "" she's no murderess , "" he argues simplistically , smitten by her beauty .   "" she's too fine a woman . ""  his attitude upsets his beautiful and increasing jealous wife , gay ( ann todd ) .  unlike most hitchcock movies , which are centered on the thriller and the mystery , this one is more a romantic melodrama .  typical is the scene in which gay flings her head back and shakes her hair while bathed in light .  she deflects her husband's affections as she fears that he is beginning to fall in love with his client .  the dramatic music then comes up high as the camera dwells on mrs . paradine's portrait nearby .  in the relatively unsatisfying first half , little happens other than domestic squabbles and overtones of intense adulterous desires .  to the sound of sweeping violins gay tells anthony that he must get mrs . paradine acquitted because , if mrs . paradine dies , his heart will go with her .  if she is freed , he will be able to forget her .  as part of the soap opera , a mysterious louis jordan plays mr . paradine's valet , who has had some not to be discussed relationships .  charles coburn plays anthony's legal partner , sir simon flaquer .  and charles laughton , who looks like coburn , is judge lord horfield .  this being proper british society , they will all dine together at the judge's house not long before the case begins .  court tv junkies will probably pick up the many differences , some subtle and others not , between the american and the british judicial systems .  one , for example , of which i was not aware is that the barrister cannot speak to his own client during the recess if she is the process of testifying .  one sometimes wonders what the academy is thinking when they make their oscar nominations .  as the judge's wife , lady sophie horfield , ethel barrymore got a nomination for best supporting actress -- the film's only nomination -- for an inconsequential part with which she did little of merit .   ( so the big question is when does hitchcock make his obligatory walk-on ?  at 37 minutes into the film , he leaves a train station carrying a large musical instrument case .  don't miss it . )  in the second half the story finally comes alive when it gets into the courtroom .  the great master shows his hand there as the tensions build as rapidly in the second part as they lay fallow in the first .  watch how the camera angles are sometimes from the back and other times from way on high to set the exact tone for the trial's action .  as anthony explains it , the simple case has only 3 possibilities : mr . paradine poisoned himself , mrs . paradine did it , or the valet did it .  the end includes many devastating revelations and some nice twists so it is too bad the first half is so languid .  the paradine case runs 1 : 53 .  the picture is in black and white .  it is not rated but would be pg for mature themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up if they are interested .  "|0.41|0.8000000000000002|0.7333333333333333|"The overall sentiment is slightly positive as the reviewers appreciate Alfred Hitchcock's films and praise ""The Paradine Case"" for its tension and performances, but mention that the first half of the movie is unsatisfying and sluggish."
1|it's wednesday , march 27 , and a murder investigation is underway in charlotte , south carolina .  the crime : a young prostitute , elizabeth ( renee zellweger ) , has been brutally slain .  one half of her severed body was found in a bag at the train station .  the other half was discovered in a trunk at the harbor authority , miles away .  the police duo of braxton ( chris penn ) and kennesaw ( michael rooker ) are strapped for leads .  at the moment , they have only one possible suspect : wayland ( tim roth ) , a wealthy , unemployed genius who graduated summa cum laude from princeton and appears to be the least likely character to commit such a heinous act .  that's the premise for deceiver , a new thriller from the pate brothers , jonas and josh , who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave .  deceiver plays out like a mind game between the intellectually superior wayland and the two not- so-bright cops ( captions early in the proceedings let us know that wayland's iq is 151 ; by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 ) .  the setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered .  over three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over .  other plot elements are thrown in for good measure .  wayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent .  braxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate .  and kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful .  the foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners .  deceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense .  the atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting .  deceiver has the power to grab an audience .  unfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing .  for , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers .  it's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications .  of course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic .  police procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner .  but the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details .  deceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute .  the pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours .  the most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened .  moments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks .  the movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere .  there are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models .  cinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look .  some of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks .  as wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting .  roth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be .  the other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective .  both play their characters like familiar types .  penn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety .  some of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors .  renee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature .  rosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition .  one of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience .  plot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters .  the pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers .  occasionally gripping and never uninteresting , deceiver is a fine noir effort .  |-0.2333333333333333|0.7666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|The text provides a slightly negative sentiment towards a murder investigation film, highlighting both positive elements such as engaging plot, atmospheric setting, and strong performances, as well as negative aspects such as an implausible twist, unanswered questions, and criticism towards the ending and portrayal of the criminal investigation process.
1|on april 12th , 1912 , the most astonishing shipwreck in the history of the world occurred .  on that fateful night , the titanic sunk .  now , more than 50 years later , a film has been made .  and what a film that is .  james cameron's newest movie is a landmark in storytelling , emotion , and special effects .  it starts in the present , where bill paxton and his band of scientists explore the depths of the ship's wreckage .  exploring an old chest , paxton comes across a nude drawing of a young woman .  the drawing is televised and the woman ( gloria stuart ) whose portrait the painting is of comes forward and slowly but surely , the ship's story is told .  leonardo dicaprio stars as jack dawson , a young man with a sketch book , a heart of gold , an intelligent mind , and not much else . he wins his ticket aboard titanic in a poker game , and is the perfect match for rose dewitt bukater ( kate winslett ) .  she grows to love jack , but seems unable to escape the slimy clutches of her arranged fiance' , cal hockley ( billy zane ) .  the film takes its time , and by doing so , makes us care about its characters , and shows us the full aspects of human emotion .  the leads shine ; there is no bad performance ; in fact , these do not seems like performances at all , but genuine people , trapped on the doomed vessel , facing certain death .  watching this film , i was amazed at how vivid and real these situations feel : the time rose and jack spend together at a third-class-party ; the naivety that jack feels when he skecthes rose nude ; the terror felt by all onboard , as certain doom turns people into both cowards and heroes .  this , the most expensive movie ever made , $200 million , is destined to make its profit back , and then some .  it also has more emotion and warmth than any other film this year . . even this decade .  it is also yet another first : the first $200 million dollar romance , and every critic in this country will agree that it was indeed , money extremely . . very   . . well  spent .  |0.4666666666666666|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive, as they all highlight the film ""Titanic"" as a landmark in storytelling, emotion, and special effects, with strong performances and vivid situations.

1|synopsis : an attractive mute makeup artist , working on an ultra-cheesy slasher movie in moscow , witnesses the production of a brutal snuff film and is subsequently chased by really bad russians .  meanwhile , the artist's sister and boyfriend clumsily try to save her .  comments : mute witness came as a surprise to me the first time i watched it .  drawn by the clever artwork on the video box , i rented the film expecting a complete turkey .  mute witness , however , was original , offbeat , and well-made .  it's one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about .  i've subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit , and it may be seen , on occasion , on the independent film channel .  the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense , as billy , the quite believable mute heroine , sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film .  the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy's vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures .  to throw a curveball into the fray , billy's sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes .  a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film .  look for alec guinness ( obi-wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy ) in a small role as the evil reaper .  definately check this movie out ; although , as a word of warning , it does contain several scenes of rather grisly violence which certainly aren't for the squeamish .  |0.6666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|0.8000000000000002|The overall sentiment of the explanations is that the movie is generally positive, praised for being original, well-made, and a cool find, with tension and suspense in the first hour.

1|the grandfather of italian horror the late mario bava has credits in nearly 100 films and tv movies produced in italy between 1939 and his death in the early 80's .  more practiced as a cinematographer than a director , bava nonetheless sat in the director's chair for beyond the door ii , the project which turned out to be his last full-length feature film .  alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci , beyond the door ii is simply a revelation .  in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker , yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970's .   ( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist-rip off behind the door , but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia . )  this story focuses on dora , a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco .  the film opens with dora , her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier .  they hope to put the past behind them , but as small accidents start to befall dora - usually while bruno is away on business - she starts to suspect that marco ( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr . ) is somehow involved in the strange goings on .  to reveal any more of the story would be unfair .  suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot , loads of atmosphere and solid acting , though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english .  bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi , wife of famed italian horror director dario argento .  her character is invested with sufficient depth to allow the audience real empathy with dora's troubled soul .  the music by italian ensemble libra is also effective , mixing odd-sounding 70's rock with classic gothic piano sequences .  and there is at least one moment - brilliantly engineered by bava - that is guaranteed to lift you ten feet out of your chair .  yet for italian horror , the bloodletting here is surprisingly minimal .  lamberto bava and francesco barbieri's script is more concerned with deeper , psychological terrors , with themes of guilt and suffering , with the notion that what we sow will shall - somewhere , somehow - eventually reap .  scholars of the genre take note : beyond the door ii is stylish , chilling , and essential .  |0.5833333333333334|0.8333333333333334|0.9|"The text is positive, praising Mario Bava as a talented filmmaker and describing ""Beyond the Door II"" as one of the finest Italian horror movies of the 1970s, highlighting the solid acting, atmosphere, and effective music."
1|"based on the relatively unknown ( in comparison to spider-man ) marvel comic book , blade tells the story of half-vampire half-human ( played by wesley snipes ) who was born of a vampire's latest meal .  now swearing vengeance against all vampires , blade hunts them all .  his latest challenge is his biggest though . . . he  must stop the vampire deacon frost ( played by stephen dorff ) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires .  admitedly , comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums , often viewed as juvenile by most standards , even seen as illiterate by some .  judging by a series of poorly recieved ( financial and critical ) comic book based films ( such as batman and robin , steel , barb wire , the crow : city of angels , and the list goes on ) , one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film .  to some degree , i agree with this sentiment .  having read comic books since the age of nine ( i'm 21 right now ) i can count the number of good comic book based movies ( not including japanese manga ) one hand : 1 : the crow ( 1994 ) , 2 : batman ( 1989 ) , 3 : superman , 4 : the mask , and now , #5 , blade .   ( "" men in black "" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book )  why is this ?  for the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand  the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match .  the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided .  the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect .  superman  is not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this .  blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere .  this is in stark contrast to joel schumacher's contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960's television show .  batman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i'm working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i'm ready ) .  which brings me back to blade .  although he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon .  the film depicts a vicious vampire killer that  uses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends .  the end results are not pretty by any means .  the story elements work very well -- for a comic book story .  screenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films .  this is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n'bushe wright .  this leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires .  add this  to the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an "" anti-theft device "" ) , and one has an interesting premise .  however , the film works best as an action film .  actor wesley snipes has  an extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move .  proving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a  good example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes .  regardless , this film is far from perfect .  the film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god .  the ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on  marked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) .  obvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) .  much of the special effects are not that spectacular either .  while vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film's release date was pushed back multiple times ) .  scenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i'm really hard to impress ) .  the film's r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of  realism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence ,  watch "" saving private ryan "" ) .  the overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi .  still , scenes involving non-cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade's sword without deactivating the "" anti-theft device "" .  wesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess .  while not talking much , he is a grand physical presence , leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust .  a decent ( by comic book film standards ) storyline also helps .

1|"quentin tarantino seems to have a knack for giving his stars big careers .  after his pulp fiction , many actors began receiving many offers for jobs .  john travolta made his come-back and is now one of today's most bankable stars .  bruce willis proved his acting chops and is now considered an actual actor .  jackie brown , on the other hand , boasts quite a well known cast , except for the main lead : pam grier .  most likely you have heard of her and seen her in films , but she's never really had a breakthrough performance ( her first film was in the roger ebert-written beyond the valley of the dolls ) .  that is , until now .  jackie brown is a highly anticipated feature film from quentin tarantino , whose last film was the huge hit pulp fiction .  after mediocre acting jobs , tarantino returns to what made his name a household one : directing and writing .  jackie brown is the result , and it is fantastic entertainment .  despite excellent direction from tarantino , the cast steals the film , giving one good performance after another .  pam grier gives a stunning performance as jackie brown , and she is supported by an incredible mix of talent--samuel l . jackson , bridget fonda , michael keaton , robert de niro , and robert forster .  more than likely , you will see a few of these names in the oscar pool come oscar nominations .  describing a quentin tarantino film is very difficult , as you really can't say much or you spoil it for everyone else .  i will tread lightly .  jackie brown opens with an impressive shot of jackie brown ( grier ) in a blue outfit walking through the airport .  the camera tracks along with her , and ends up revealing her occupation .  we are also introduced to ordell robbie ( jackson ) , who sells illegal guns to interested buyers . . .  for a hefty price .  ms . brown carries the money from buyer to ordell in order to keep the cops away .  however , an fbi agent ( keaton ) and a local l . a . cop ( michael bowen ) are out to find ordell and catch him while taking the money .  they try to reach him through beaumont livingston ( chris tucker ) , one of ordell's buyers , but he mysteriously ends up dead .  they try again through brown , but she is hesitant to admit to any wrong-doing .  but after unknowingly carrying some drugs for one of ordell's friends ( fonda ) , she is caught and sent to jail .  ordell pays her bail through a bail bond agent , max cherry ( forster ) , and then wants to find out what she told the cops .  after she claims to have said nothing , she reveals the fact that she will tell them about ordell in order to stay out of prison .  ordell doesn't like this , but they both come up with a scheme to throw the feds and cops off their track .  this scheme seems to be going as planned , but unexpected occurances may or may not foul up their goal .  revealing more would spoil the fun of jackie brown , and that's the biggest reason to go see a tarantino film .  tarantino seems to have a fascination with hitmen and unusual predicaments ( and slang terms ) , but they are always done very well and believably .  his hitmen are normally cruel , but pleasant , in that nasty sort of way .  they talk like normal people , except for when doing business , and they are rude to their girlfriends .  of course , this is a tarantino film , and you know you can expect some awkward situations to arise .  and perhaps the biggest flaw with jackie brown is the slow middle section in which the pace begins to drop .  of course , tarantino fixes this by moving onto the climax of the film , adding a lot of his reservoir dogs-style storytelling to it .  things are told from one person's perspective , and then from another , and then from another , each time learning more and more .  this all leads up to a very interesting conclusion , which decides who is on whose side .  on the technical side of jackie brown , quentin tarantino directs it with the same style as he did with his 1994 film .  however , this time around it isn't as nearly as impressive or original .  the writing , on the other hand , is quite good , although i do find tarantino's use of slang terms offensive .  the story jumps back and forth in time as in pulp fiction , but it's much more easy to understand .  his previous film needed a second viewing in order to understand the time differentiation , but jackie brown is very simply to follow , especially considering that the time is given during the "" leaps "" in time .  perhaps this is a result of the screenplay being written from the novel "" rum punch "" by elmore leonard .  the dialogue is pretty much intelligent , and all the characters are fully realized .  the cinematography is very well done by guillermo navarro ( who has worked with tarantino on previous films ) and the editing is very good .  and as with pulp fiction , the music is a highlight , bringing back memorable songs from the 70s and 80s .  the acting side of jackie brown is unforgettable .  the performances are incredibly rich , with hidden meaning behind every characters' actions .  nothing is quite as it seems , and you can't really tell which side one person is on .  the real treat , of course , is pam grier who gives an astonishing performance as jackie brown .  her poor living conditions are superceded by her superior wits , which play an important role in the film .  watching grieg , i could tell what was going through her mind , even if i didn't know what she was thinking .  her face portrays a lot of emotion that you can tell when she is sad , happy , or in deep thought .  bridget fonda gives a very good performance as a druggie couch potato .  i didn't even realize it was fonda until i saw her name in the final credits ( her performance actually reminded me of heather graham's in boogie nights ) .  michael keaton comes across very well , as does michael bowen .  chris tucker has a small , but effective performance .  samuel l . jackson is very good , but it seems to me that he was replaying his jules winnfield character from pulp fiction ( although much less cynical ) .  but no matter . . .  jackson is very strong in his role .  robert de niro is actually a little annoying at times , but overall he does a good job as one of ordell's perspective clients and friends .  robert forster gives one of the best performances in the film , as he has one of the most developed characters .  he is present throughout most of the film , and he holds his own against jackson and grier .  jackie brown is rated r for language , sex , violence , drug use , and some offensive remarks .  as a film by itself , jackie brown is a terrific piece of entertainment , with a complex plot to draw viewers in .  however , one can not help but compare it to tarantino's pulp fiction , and expect great results .  when compared , it comes up short , but not that short .  it's a worthy effort , with terrific acting and some impressive writing from elmore leonard and tarantino .  perhaps the best thing about jackie brown is the discovery of pam grier as a major hollywood actress .  i can't remember seeing her in anything ( except for a small role in

1|"the makers of jurassic park & the director of speed conjure up a storm !   ( reviewed at eng wah's new jubilee cineplex at ang mo kio )   "" unlike earthquakes , their fury is precise .  unlike hurricanes , their reach is unlimited .  unlike fires , there is no way to combat them .  unlike floods , their terror is sudden . ""  - excerpt from twister production notes  i'm sure many of us living in this part of the world have never seen tornadoes ( or twisters ) before .  i for one , have only seen the devastating effects and footage of tornadoes from news reports on tv and personally , i feel tornado-caused destruction comes no where near the destruction caused by hurricanes and earthquakes . . . . . . . . that is until i saw twister .  the destruction caused by twisters may be precise ( not widespread but it moves very fast and its path of destruction is unpredictable .  it will suck in cars , houses , livestock , etc . . . . .  basically anything in its path that is not firmly rooted to the ground and in twister , you'll get to see all this - close up !  twister tells a tale about a group of storm chasers .  these people are basically out-of-their-mind and for the sake of obtaining data on twister-occurrences , they risk their lives by literally chasing tornadoes , trying to get as close as they can . . . . . that  is if the tornado does not suddenly decide to change its path towards them !  jo ( helen hunt ) is the leader of this pack of kamikazes .  while they are gearing up for the mother-of-all-storms as predicted by satellite recon , bill ( bill paxton ) , a former co- leader of the team returns to settle some divorce papers with jo .  apparently , bill has left his rogue-ish days for greener and more practical pastures - as a television weatherman .  he catches up with his old-self and follows the pack like the good ole days , bringing his wife-to-be melissa ( jamie gertz ) along , a city-bred woman toting around with a handphone .  jo has finally implemented bills initial idea of a device called dorothy which measurement's of a twister may lead to a better understanding on how tornadoes are formed so that a more reliable early-warning system can be implemented .  the problem is , the device has to be placed very near the twister , and in its path ( which is practically unpredictable ) of destruction in order for it to function .  to add to their current challenge , there is another group of storm chasers that is corporation-funded led by jonas ( cary elwes ) and they too have a similar device .  thus begins the race ; jo's cheap government equipment with beaten-up vehicles against jonas's high-tech computers and satellite link-ups with their sleek , black all-terrain vans .  plot wise , there are not really anything to shout about .  twister is as predictable as any summer box-office hit can get .  there is the danger of the twister , the competition with jonas^os more well-off team and of course , the settling of differences between jo and bill ( this part gives the film its human substance ) .  helen hunt , bill paxton and the rest of the actors/actresses give only average performances and all of them take back seat to the main thespian in this movie - the twister itself !  thanks to the impressive digital effects by ilm ( lucasfilm's industrial light and magic ) , we get to see the terror and destruction caused by tornadoes up close ; from stripping barns and houses to lifting up livestock !  jan de bont once again proves his visual abiility ( thanks to his years of experience as a director of photography for action films ) for action sequences .  like his previous film speed , the tornado sequences ( which are essentially the action sequences ) are well visualised and edited .  audiences will be holding tight to their chairs everytime a tornado comes on screen !  the surround sound effects sure does help a lot in stressing the terror of a twister !   ( the cinema must at the very least support digital sound to fully appreciate this ) twister is definitely an effect-dependent movie .  now that id4 fever has begun to reside , and people are getting bored of watching will smith whoop et's ass for the umpteenth time . . . . . . twister is your sure bet of 7 bucks well spent !  watch it in a good theatre . . . please .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

1|"there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor's effort .  often a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile .  when one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders .  but sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with "" the hurricane . ""  this biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin "" hurricane "" carter would normally be called "" norman jewison's 'the hurricane , ' "" as per the tradition of referring to a film "" belonging "" to a director .  but though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of "" the hurricane , "" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington .  washington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar .  jailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals .  the situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter .  through the efforts of that group and carter's lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted .  the film details carter's childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) .  when he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide .  despite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned .  flash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison .  the book , entitled "" the sixteenth round , "" opens young lesra's eyes to the injustice that was carter's life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer .  lesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal .   "" the hurricane "" leans on denzel washington .  he must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly .  it's probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be .  it would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film .  the actor's work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm's length .  we feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost .  washington's is a performance of weight and emotional depth .  he doesn't merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level .  his work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor .  norman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection .   "" the hurricane "" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely .  jewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing .  his boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from "" raging bull , "" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage .  jewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell .  jewison's best achievement in "" the hurricane "" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again .  sadly , though , the film's chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter .  there is much to interest a viewer in "" the hurricane , "" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does .  take a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil .  carter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ; everyone else is a stereotype .  the canadians are good .  the cops are bad .  the canadians spend most of their time dolefully grinning at each other in their lovey-dovey commune ( and it is a commune , despite the film's failure to make that clear ) , while every racist cop ( especially dan hedaya's ) melts in out of the shadows and glowers at every black person that enters the room .  much of the dialogue comes off as rather hokey ( "" hate put me in prison .  love's gonna bust me out . "" ) , and the big courtroom climax during which everyone gets to make an impassioned speech could have been lifted from a made-for-tv lifetime special .  it's too bad .  the cast is game , the director does his job , and the subject matter is interesting , but the script takes the safer , slightly more boring route far too often .  i wanted a real reason for the cop to hold a grudge against carter other than "" he's a racist pig . ""  i wanted more evidence that these canadians are real people with faults and virtues instead of a bunch of saintly crusaders looking for justice .  in short , i wanted to see the film through a less distorted lens .  criticism has been levied against the liberties "" the hurricane "" takes with the truth of what really happened to carter , and much of it is deserved .  for example , the film gives us a boxing scene showing carter pummeling defending champ joey giardello , only to be screwed by the judges , who ruled giardello the winner .  most accounts of the fight , however , have carter losing fairly .  furthermore , much of carter's criminal past is conveniently left out of the film , and just why he was convicted again in his second trial is never really explained .  of course , "" the hurricane "" works mainly as a fable , so digressions from the truth can be excused at least partially , but even dismissing such issues don't remove one fact : "" the hurricane "" is a highly flawed film .  only one actor could have made a schmaltzy , predictable picture like this work as well as it does , and it's a good thing "" the hurricane "" has that actor .  carter has been quoted as saying , "" denzel washington is making me look good , "" but he's not the only one .  washington makes this film look good .  denzel washington's "" the hurricane . ""  sounds pretty good to me .

1|"contact is a nobly intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying adaptation of carl sagan's only novel .  it details the circumstances surrounding the first clear sign of intelligent life in outer space and their effects on the life of a young and idealistic radio astronomer named ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) .  we first meet ellie at a giant radio telescope in puerto rico , where she is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project .  her research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains "" pure research "" in favor of science with "" commercial applications .  she goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s . r .  hadden ( john hurt ) .  then , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal .  in the movie's most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega .  at first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before .  further decoding , with hadden's help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine .  it appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens' home world .  of course , the big question becomes "" who gets to ride it ? ""   ( right after "" who's gonna pay for this thing ? "" ) .  to boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith .  drumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep "" godless science "" from talking to god , or something like that ) .  then hadden reappears with startling news .  he has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest .  ellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse ) .  when she returns home , no one believes her .  she was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours .  her story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don't even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static .   .   .  eighteen hours worth of static ) .  there is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first .  ellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working .  neither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that's a tough standard to meet .  ellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures .  her real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally .  drumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble .  hadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board .  even palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie's love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses .  the film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine .  the part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain .  the film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion .  this is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved .  the film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith .  religious people are presented as shallow caricatures .  rob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right .  another religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey ) .  the only really fleshed-out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague .  i can't even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian .  all we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex .  the film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith .  in a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist "" religious "" doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send .  in a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism .  what ellie should have said was , "" you shouldn't believe me .  not without evidence , and i don't have the evidence .  i know what happened but you shouldn't take my word alone . ""  that is the voice of science speaking .  the character of david drumlin is another problem with this film .  his attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position .  also , his profession of "" faith "" before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it .  the last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles .  the media figures , such as bernard shaw and jay leno aren't so bad , in as much as their participation was voluntary .  the use of bill clinton , however , should give anyone pause .  first of all , lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line , thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken , is just plain creepy .  also , using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 , forever dating it .  people watching this film in the future will say , "" hey , this never took place during clinton's term . ""  this bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief .  also , the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century .  better to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all .  the film does raise an interesting question , although it never develops it in a satisfying way .  if we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture , would an atheist be automatically disqualified just because ninety percent of the population of the world professes a belief in god , or at least some form of supernatural creator ?  personally , i would hope not , since religion is basically an opinion , a form of ideology .  i would not want any form of ideological test for such an import task .

1|"david cronenberg presents us with another strange tale crawling out of his impressively twisted head .  it is one of many science fiction films , released during the last year of this millenium , that tackles issues that will play an important role in our future .  the story unfolds in a near future , where the line between reality and virtual reality blurs .  the world of the future is an unfriendly place , where the scared inhabitants are "" hiding "" in virtual reality fantasy games to escape the uncertainty of the real world .  allegra geller ( jennifer jason leigh ) , the leading game designer in the world , is testing her new virtual reality game , existenz with a focus group .  as they begin , she is attacked by a fanatic assassin employing a bizarre organic gun .  she flees with a young marketing trainee , ted pikul ( jude law ) , who is suddenly assigned as her bodyguard .  unfortunately , her pod , an organic gaming device that contains the only copy of the existenz game program , is damaged .  to inspect it , she talks ted into accepting a gameport in his own body so he can play the game with her .  the events leading up to this , and the resulting game lead the pair on a strange adventure in a world where individuality doesn't exist , as the "" players "" are forced to perform as characters in an unknown plot .  here the reality and their actions are impossible to determine from either their own or the game's perspective .  i don't intend to reveal more of the film's premise , which is structured as a computer game , with "" tasks "" that the characters must complete to win the game .  released after "" the matrix "" and "" dark city "" , "" existenz "" has some similarities and parallels that connect it to these films .  however , "" existenz "" is moving in a different direction , with a premise of its own .  a combination of dazzling special effects , brilliantly coordinated action sequences and an intelligent and sophisticated plot , made "" the matrix "" a rare and entertaining science fiction experience , with some dark and frightening ideas hidden under its sparkling facade .

1|"after hearing reviews for woody allen's upteenth movie in history , "" celebrity , "" range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of "" manhattan , "" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time .  woody allen's films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( "" manhattan "" really is one of the best-looking films i've ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city's best areas , etc . ) , a fan can't help but feel visibly moved .  the film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word "" help "" being spelled with an airplane .  beethoven's 5th blasts on the soundtrack .  the city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it's all rather lovely to look at .  and then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film's hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something's wrong with her life or whatever .  it's a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year's "" deconstructing harry "" came awfully close ) .  what the hell has happened to him ?  the man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas .   "" bullets over broadway , "" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off .   "" mighty aphrodite "" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story .   "" everyone says i love you "" was more of a great idea than a great film .  even "" deconstructing harry "" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films .  if anything , the reception of "" celebrity "" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it's not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it's him .   "" celebrity "" is , yes , a good film , but it's only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film .  instead of creating the great woody allen world , he's created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about .  and he's fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections .  it's like "" la dolce vita "" without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis .  woody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead .  much has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh's performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation .  branagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character's flaws to be more apparent .  woody's a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he's really funny and really witty and really intelligent .  branagh's allen is a bit more flat-out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we're still not sure if he's really a good person or not .  his character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him . . . sorta .  we then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion .  he has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie "" but with a deep personal crisis "" ) .  as such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film .  after griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is "" polymorphously perverse "" ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of "" la dolce vita . ""  following are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all .  his story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status .  while lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( "" i've become the kind of woman i've always hated . . . and  i'm loving it . "" )  without doing a thing .  the result is a film of highs and mediums .  the mediums are what take up most of the film , with sitations and scenes which don't exactly work but you can't help but pat allen on the back for trying .  but other places are really great scenes .  the opening .  the sequence with theron , which is so good that i wished it hadn't ended .  a banana scene with bebe neuwirth ( droll as ever ) .  and , perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot-as-hell teen idol , brandon darrow , played by none other than leo dicaprio , who is so un-dicaprio-esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film , they'd never look at him the same way .  he ignites the screen with intensity , and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical , and totally heartbreaking for lee , who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read , and finds himself on a wild all-day ride with him .  they go to atlantic city to watch a fight , they gamble , and they wind up in his hotel room , where darrow gets it on with his flame ( gretchen mol ) and he lends him one of the leftover groupies .  allen's writing in these scenes are so good that just for them , i'd almost recommend the film .  almost .  but what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it's a mess , despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself , it's still a smart and insightful film .  though some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities , as it may seem to be ( if it were , it'd be extremely out-of-touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity-hood with happiness .  we never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they're really happy ( they may appear to be on the surface . . . ) , but we do get close enough to lee and davis' character .  lee is obsessed with the phenomenon , while davis takes is at arm's length , and never gets too involved in what it is , and soon becomes one herself .  besides , it's witty , and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen's : that great woody allen feel .  it may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject , and yes , as a part of woody allen's oeuvre , it's merely a blip ( no "" annie hall "" but it's no "" shadows and fog "" either ) , but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him , and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor , like the one in the beginning , and make it work not once but twice .

1|"call me crazy , but i don't see saving private ryan as the film of the summer .  a good movie , yes , with chillingly realistic battle scenes and emotion to spare .  an utterly riviting movie on par with steven spielberg's best work , no .  personally , if i was spielberg , i wouldn't go back to the world war ii era one more time after schindler's list and the indiana jones movies .  i'm guessing steve has a thing for nazis ; i really wouldn't be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika-wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie .  all lofty pretenses aside , saving private ryan is the goriest movie this side of a 1980s slasher flick .  the difference is , it's easy during friday the 13th to laugh off a spear sticking out of kevin bacon's chest while blood spurts like crazy , but it's damn hard to sit and eat reese's pieces while soldiers suffer machine gun bullets to the head and have their intestines spilled out onto the battlefield .  and believe me , there's plenty of it .  a 30-minute sequence at the beginning of the movie has an army captain ( tom hanks ) and his soldiers landing at omaha beach to join countless other americans who are already under fire .  lives are lost in seconds as the purposefully confusing and jarring scene goes on and on , and all the young men in the audience find themselves never , ever wanting to be drafted .  cut to some bureaucratic defense office , where a hundred women pound out sympathy form letters to the families of the casualties .  one woman happens upon an interesting detail -- three brothers in different platoons were killed in combat , and their mother is getting the telegram today .  i guess it's an interesting conversation piece to everyone but the mother , so the army chief ( harve presnell ) sends hanks on what is essentially a public relations mission , to find the fourth ryan brother and send him home .  that way , the army saves the postage on yet another telegram to mrs . ryan .  one good thing about saving private ryan is that the soldiers who are headed to rescue ryan know it's a mission designed to make the army look good .  they question the worth of risking eight soldiers' lives to save one , and hanks' character admits he doesn't give a damn about ryan ; he's just following orders .  if this was a john wayne movie , things would be different .  there'd be a phony , "" let's go get that boy , gosh darn it ! ""  attitude that would sugarcoat the reality of war .  by doing things this way , spielberg admits the instincts of self- preservation and complacency that every normal person has .  it makes saving private ryan a lot more powerful than an testosterone-driven stallone movie mission .  the movie's pattern is to have long battle scenes followed by quiet scenes of semi-introspective conversation among the soldiers .  hanks is painted first as a nails-tough army man careful to hide his true self from the other men .  it's not that way for long .  edward burns , the guy you get for your movie when ben affleck isn't available , is the impulsive one .  jeremy davies plays the translator who is seeing combat for the first time , and so on .  none of the characters are fascinating or natural born heroes , but was spielberg's obvious intention .  i wondered when i heard saving private ryan was three hours long , how were they going to fill three hours' time searching for one person and still make it interesting ?  there are a few false starts ; hanks finds one private ryan in ted danson's company ( apparently , danson joined the army after "" ink "" was canceled . ) and breaks the bad news before learning it's the wrong ryan .  and of course the movie's far from over when hanks does locate ryan ( matt damon , the other guy you get when affleck isn't available ) .  that's when the movie turns into more of a conventional war flick , although body parts and limbs still fly like never before .  saving private ryan is worth your time , but it's definitely no schindler's list .  the battle scenes are intense and realistic , but some of the attempts at sincere emotion aren't .  the movie's bookends are particularly cheesy and out of place , when an old private ryan goes to the cemetary with his family and bawls his eyes out , whining , "" tell me i've led a good life .  tell me i'm a good man . ""  spielberg was apparently following the james cameron line of thought that any three-hour movie about the past should be framed by a self-contained prologue and epilogue that takes place in the present .  much more effective are subtler scenes , like the one where several of hanks' men are rifling thrugh a bag of dogtags from dead soldiers , and they make light of what they're doing by pretending they're playing poker .  this while an airborne division marches by , their eyes full of that mound of dogtags .  by not explicitly pointing out that it symbolizes the random poker game that life and death can be in war , the audience gets the message .  and even if it's not a classic , saving private ryan is definitely one of the better war movies out there .

1|"seen august 8 , 1998 at 6 p . m . at rotterdam square cinemas ( rotterdam , ny ) , theater #6 , by myself for free using my sony/loews critic's pass .  [theater rating : * * * : good seats , sound , and picture]  war is a topic that can't help but be glorified any way it is portrayed by the media .  movies , documentaries , and even history books have a way of making the darker side of humanity exciting since the most general aspects are focused on , such as strategy , politics , and victory .  it's easy to forget war , in its most basic form , is a battle of armies out to slaughter each other .  forgotten more easily is the fact that each soldier , no matter what his rank or importance , is a real flesh-and-blood person and not just a number .   "" saving private ryan "" is one of the few films that dares play up this aspect , especially in its unapologetic , realistic delivery .  it proves there's a huge difference between battling and killing .  the film opens with one of the most graphic , disturbing scenes in recent memory .  it's world war ii , d-day to be exact , and the u . s . military is invading omaha beach where the nazis are more than ready for them .  spielberg uses many techniques to create for a total sense of reality .  instead of positioned cameras , the footage here seems to have been shot by camera operators running alongside soldiers as if they were just as scared .  there is no sense of stability , but of constant , anxious , and confusing motion , giving us the feeling of being in the middle of the battle , and just a vulnerable as the poor troops .   "" poor "" is a proper word to describe how pathetic and yet innocent the men fighting are .  there is little to no dialogue throughout the loud battle and no prologue to define any characters .  we don't get the feeling these are handsome actors playing heroic roles , but that these are men about to kill and be killed for reasons beyond their understanding .  the nazis are not portrayed as enemies to be hated , but as people that must be destroyed because they're there .  in the movies , the good guys can run through a firestorm of bullets and bombs and not get a scratch , but in reality that wouldn't happen .  the men have nothing to shield or protect them besides some metal flanks and dead bodies .  they are sitting ducks and we realize this through the perspective of the well-secured germans who can actually see who , what , and where they're shooting , unlike the americans who must fire in a general direction to avoid getting their heads blown off .  perhaps the film is flawed by not providing any backstory on the war itself and who the men really are , but that seems to be part of the theme .  the film seems to rely on the audience's sense of patriotism , that the american military is "" right "" and good and that the nazis are "" inherently evil . ""  the battle scene eventually focuses on a group of men who have miraculously survived and made their way close to the enemy stronghold ( a whole 50-foot progression ) , and begin to inflict some damage .  i have to admit that once the first glimpse of victory over the nazis sprang up , i couldn't help but feel some sense of joy and relief .  to triumph against all odds is a cliche to be sure , but there's nothing cliche about the graphic , detailed , atmosphere here because it really happened .  one of the most surprising aspects of the film is how little story construction there is , and yet the events that take place make sense and are interesting .  the plot is practically irrelevant since the film is more concerned with the reality of the war and the soldiers we meet .  tom hanks stars as captain miller , a relatively average man who happens to be the leader of a platoon .  he's never obsessive or any such generic , cartoonish characteristic that might dominate a character like this .  he doesn't want to be there any more than his men , but when he is given a mission he intends to carry it out .  the mission the film is concerned with is , as the title states , saving private ryan .  through a series of command started by an ordinary clerical worker , it is brought to a general's attention that three brothers from iowa have been killed in action and their mother will receive notices of each's death simultaneously .  when they learn a fourth brother is stationed somewhere in europe , they make it a top priority to have him returned safely to his mother .  it's easy to sympathize with this situation , after all , no one should have to lose all their children at once .  but finding one man in this war is , as miller puts it , "" like trying to find a needle in a stack of needles . ""  the saving of private ryan isn't just a dramatic device , but a thematic one .  his salvation represents the sense of innocence the country , the world even , was trying to convince itself it still had .  when miller's company hears of the mission , they scoff at the idea assuming he is dead , but miller isn't so quick to shrug it off .  he knows the only thing that can really save soldiers from death is hope , and now he has the opportunity to make someone's sense of hope a reality .  the mission to find ryan gives miller's group a destination , but not direction .  along the way many things happen to them , both good and bad .  a few battles are fought , not to be major accomplishments for the war , but because they encounter german soldiers and have no other choice .  the act of killing itself becomes one of the film's major philosophical metaphors .  the soldiers don't mind killing other soldiers in blind battle , but when they come across a lone survivor who begs them to let him go , they can barely stop themselves from killing him in cold blood as some kind of vengeance for their losses .  unfortunately , death is a fact of war , and most films try to avoid it when it comes to the main characters , but here spielberg doesn't want us to think these men are invincible .  in fact , only a small amount of color and personality is sketched into each man , and the performances are good enough to make this method work .  although the characters are somewhat typical , the actors maintain control over the material at all time .  whether they're arguing with each other , telling stories of back home , or fighting the germans , they never go overboard and always seem believable .  sure , there's a zinger here and there , but war doesn't change the fact boys will be boys .  if and when one dies we too can feel the loss , even though we hardly knew them .  the final act brings the story full circle with another tremendous , violent battle sequence .  private ryan has been found , but facing four to one odds , can the americans defeat the germans and keep ryan alive ?  that's not a premise for thrills , it's symbolic of everything the film has worked for .  it would be wrong to say the film has either a happy or sad ending , it ends the way it must end .  i remember reading a "" calvin & hobbes "" comic strip where calvin asked his dad something like , "" dad , how do armies of men killing each other solve problems ? ""   "" saving private ryan "" is the adult version of that question .

""  then all hell breaks loose in new york .  a bus is destroyed , killing 25 civilians .  a broadway theater is bombed .  hostages are taken at a school .  as the wave of terrorist activity crests , the president must consider if the only way to save the city and break the grip of fear is to declare martial law .  devereaux argues against that eventuality , but is nevertheless ready to lead 10 , 000 men into action on american soil .  another person not in favor of martial law is anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) , the fbi agent in charge of investigating the terrorist activities .  his staff is comprised of smart , energetic , intelligent men and women very much unlike the usual group o !  f moronic feds we're used to seeing in movies .  hubbard develops an uneasy alliance with cia agent elise kraft ( annette bening ) , whose department knows more about the situation than they're willing to reveal .  but the attacks escalate .  the fbi are helpless , chasing an invisible enemy .  the land is under siege .  they have lost control . . a  terror is coming from within . .  what's great about this film is that it is made as if holding up a mirror to life .  it reflects reality .  and that's why it makes such an impact .  edward zwick has created a clever , well written and terrifying thriller that may very well be one of the best films of the season .  the director manages to tell several stories simultaneously .  and so his film plays on several levels , never loosing focus on its main objective .  he is exploring the abuse of power , the distrustful relationships that exist between various segments of the u . s . government ( the army , the fbi , and the cia ) .  he takes a look at the complexities inherent when so many secrets and lies are involved .  the palestinian community in 1998 new york is treated exactly as japanese americans were during world war ii .  there are concentration camps and unlawful interments , all in the name of the "" greater good . ""  in the latter part of the film the land of opportunities looses its heart and soul -- freedom .  was that what the terror !  ists really wanted ?  this film has evoked protests and objections from the arab-american population in the u . s . and n . y . especially .  but to me these protests seem unnecessary .  zwick is careful to not step over the line and make the palestinians typical hollywood bad guys .  the script is therefore wonderfully balanced .  agent hubbard's best friend and loyal colleague frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) is lebanese-american .  and it is quite often you hear lines such as "" my first boyfriend was palestinian .  they seduce you with their suffering "" or "" they love this country as much as we do . ""  but no matter how you twist this matter , you won't get away from the fact that when it comes to world wide terrorism it is arab-speaking population who are in the great majority .  more to the point , the siege demonstrates the injustice of blanket condemnation of any ethnic group by depicting the unfair treatment of all arab-americans by the u . s . military .  and thus this film does not serve as a source for discrimination in any !  way .  denzel washington is dashing as always .  in this role he is much more determined and stronger than usual .  anette bening is enjoyable and believable as a shadowy cia operative who prefers espionage , a network of snitches and seduction to gather information . .  bruce willis is terrifying as the sadist , hungry for power , that never looses his connection with the audience , since his point of view is not too hard to understand .  the film is elegantly shaped .  the scenes are easily floating into each other and the film never seems overlong .  zwick knows exactly how to provoke tension , horror and emotions and does it with a rarely observed professionalism .  he tightens the intensity as the events progress .  and when a plot twist comes , it actually is surprising .  it is not a film drained in patriotism , like the work of roland emerich .  nor is it a film that portrays explosions purely for entertainment values .  it is a daring picture that has courage enough to undertake such a risky story and difficult journey .  it has courage enough to get involved in politics .  it questions our foreign policies , mentality and defense .  i must admit that it ends rather disappointing , as the director turns the patriotism way up and innovation down .  but despite of that , it is certainly an intelligent and thrilling film that provokes emotions and thoughts ; a virtue that few summer films can boast of .

1|" "" desperate measures "" was something i was excited about seeing back when it was originally scheduled to be released : summer '97 .  for some reason , it was delayed until hollywood's traditional dumping ground : january .  now that it's out , i see no real reason for that delay , as it's a simple yet highly entertaining film .  michael keaton stars as a maniacial murderer who's bone marrow can save the life of the dying son of a san francisco police detective ( garcia ) .  keaton agrees to the transplant , only so he can attempt escape .  he succeeds , in a plan that of course could only work in the movies .  the police force is now trying to kill keaton , while garcia is working against them trying to keep keaton alive in order to save his son .  the film definately has it's flaws .  the plot is strictly tv movie of the week fare , but the acting and direction certainly boost it far above that status .  also , after keaton's escape , garcia's captain barks at him "" how many men have to die to save your kid's life ? ""  which the film treats as such an evil and insignificant remark .  the thing is , it's a vaild point .  how many people have to be needlessly crippled , burned , and killed just to save this one child ?  what's the greater good here ?  many lives or one life ?  if movies really had guts nowadays , i would have loved to have seen this movie come down to a final choice for garcia's character .  place him in a situation where he knows that he has to kill keaton because keaton is about to kill someone else .  alas , movies these days generally have no such ambition to pull the audience's strings in ways which might make the uncomfortable .  despite a few silly moments ( and one or two really stupid ones ) , the good things about "" desperate measures "" outnumber the bad .  the main highlight would be keaton's performance .  the character could have easily been an overacting , scene chewing freak , but keaton underplays it nicely .  he's not as menacing as he was in "" pacific heights "" or even as menacing as he was in "" batman "" ( yes kids , batman used to be a dark character ) , but you certainly get the idea that he's evil .  even the final scene of the film , which normally i would just hate , seems strangely appropriate for this film .  so much so that i didn't mind it in the slightest .  and another bonus : the film takes place in san francisco , which usually means a car chase on those hills that you've seen a billion times before .  and for a moment , it looked as though it was about to happen .  but it doesn't , and that's creative .

1|"what is a scary movie anyhow ?  is it a movie where a person gets ripped to shreds ?  is it where a person is being chased by some damned teenager who wants revenge ?  possibly its some guy with a hook who wants to know what you did last summer .  what ever happened to horror movies , where the horror was in the atmosphere , and in the characters .  movies like "" halloween "" and "" psycho "" which revolutionized horror genre forever , but wait in 1973 came a movie based on the bestselling book by william peter blatty , entitled "" the exorcist "" , the movie opened to rave reviews , and scared audiences to death , now in the year 2000 "" the exorcist "" comes back to the big screen in a version you've never seen complete with six channel digital surround sound , and fifteen minutes of new footage never before seen as long as a new ending .  chris mcniell is an actress living in georgetown washington with her twelve year old daughter regan .  while working on a new film , chris still stays close to regan , but starts to wonder why her bed shakes at night , and why regan starts to have convulsions all of a sudden .  when chris finds out that regan is possessed by a demon , she shuns at the fact of it , but considers getting a priest to help her daughter .  father karras ( jason miller ) is the man they bring in , his mother has just died , and still in mourning he decides to help this little girl .  christ , father karras , and their nanny sharon ( kitty winn ) have to sit and wait until a man shows up , that man is the exorcist , and that man will help this little girl .  excrutiatingly scary , the exorcist is a classic horror film , which twenty seven years later still scares audiences half to death .  now we get to the experience "" the exorcist "" the way it was meant to be seen in a director's cut which incorpates fifteen minutes of new footage cut by friedkin at the time of the release for content and time , a new ending has been added as well , and adds more of a lighter feeling to the movie , which i prefer the original darker ending more .  the movie has also been remastered in a wonderful six channel digital sound mix , and is amazing .  the voices are all clear , the music pours out on you and engulfs you in richness .  as a director friedkin has been well known for other films , but his standout film is "" the exorcist "" nominated for several academy awards it one a few , but was somehow doubted best picture , best actress ( ellen burstyn ) and best supporting actress ( linda blair ) who at the age of i believe thirteen does a wonderful job of being a little girl , alone , possessed and unable to stop what is going on .  ellen burstyn i think gives her best performance to date , and can be seen currently in "" requiem for a dream "" to which she is getting rave reviews for .  jason miller ( jason patrik's dad ) is amazing as father karras , and his performance will be forever embedded in my mind , to me he is the character who makes the entire film float along .  i was saddened when i saw this film with an audience of mostly younger people to see them laughing at this movie , i in no way , think that this movie is comical , yes some of the stuff regan says is funny , but they were laughing at her head spinning , and the green pea soup , come on people this is some creepy stuff !  anyway the re-release of the film has managed to make $40 million dollars , and is still going .  hopefully one day they re-release it again in twenty years for more generations to come to enjoy .

1|this is a good year if you want plenty of sci-fi on your multiplex .  >from the comedies mars attacks and men in black , to luc besson's powerful the fifth element , and to this , sci-fi/horror that is event horizon .   ( more is on the way with contact and alien : ressurection being released later this year . )  the story is thus : in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive .  a device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe , instantaneously .  this is achieved by creating a gateway , infact , a black hole , between the craft and it's required destination .  in this case , from near neptune to proxima prime .  however , when the event horizon attempts this , it dissappears , without trace , leaving two searches for it fruitless .  seven years later , it reappears , transmitting a distress signal and this is where the film starts .  a search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate .  the team is led by laurence fishburne , and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive .  as the team search the event horizon , they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around .  not a good sign . . .  to make matters worse , as they search the ship , they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse , some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago .  it soon becomes apparent that , wherever the ship went , it bought something back with it .  something very , very evil . . .  the first thing you'll notice in this film is it's incredible visual effects .  they really are eye popping , with some great models to boot .  the acting is quite good , with some occasional witty moments .  sam neill does a good job as the scientist that increasingly becomes more and more disturbed as the search continues , but a tip of the hat goes to laurence fishburne who leads the team , in a cool , calm , take no nonense manner .  it is his acting skills that help hold this film together .  the idea behind event horizon is certainly a good one .  it starts off incredibly well , but the middle section becomes quite confused and sometimes muddled , leaving the viewer unsure on just what the reasons are behind some of the bloody and bizarre events that occur .  however , the closing 20 minutes of the film more than make up for this , producing one the most nail biting ( or in my case , straw of my drink biting ! )  climaxes i've recently witnessed .  overall , event horizon is a smart film indeed .  it's very enjoyable and has some amazing visuals .  but be warned , the horror scenes , despite being very brief are very , very , gory .  not for the squemish !  |0.4833333333333334|0.8000000000000002|0.8333333333333334|The analysis rates this text as slightly positive overall, as the reviewer praises the visual effects and acting in the film, but mentions that the middle section becomes confused and muddled.
