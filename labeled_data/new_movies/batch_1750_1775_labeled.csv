0|"disney's "" air bud "" tells a boy-and-his-dog story with a twist -- the pooch is quite an accomplished basketball player .  granted , for a family comedy , it's not a very funny or successful idea to begin with , but it doesn't seem to matter -- "" air bud "" is surprisingly solemn .  save for occasional moments of forced slapstick , the movie wags its tale with a straight face -- not a very enjoyable approach .  if "" air bud "" had realized its own absurdity , then it possibly could have been better .  here , we're actually asked to cheer a moment when the dog marches out to save the big game , clad in two pairs of sneakers and even a jersey .  its number ?  k9 .  yeah , whatever .  the movie opens as golden retriever buddy ( as himself ) escapes from his current owner , abusive clown-for-hire norm snively ( michael jeter ) .  he ends up in fernwell , washington , where mopey new-kid-on-the-block josh ( kevin zegers ) is trying to cope with the move and the recent death of his father .  buddy , kevin .  kevin , buddy .  once the dog proves his on-court prowess , kevin's self-esteem rockets .  they both win places in the school's basketball team , with the animal as their mascot .  but before they can make it to the finals , snively surfaces to reclaim buddy .  everything plays out just as one would think : heavy on predictability , light on an actual story .  the movie follows a calculated chain of events -- kevin's gloom fades , snively gets his comeuppance and buddy contracts rabies and must be executed old yeller-style .  okay , that last one's a lie , but at least it would have been a quicker send-off than "" air bud "" 's courtroom climax -- no joke !  there's even a faux-cute musical montage where a reluctant buddy gets cleaned-up to "" splish splash . ""  paint cans are spilled and newspapers are buried , all in the name of formula .  the end credits note that "" no special visual effects were used in the basketball sequences of this motion picture . ""  that very well may be true , and although to see a dog sink shots is quite a sight , a movie cannot exist on feat alone .  but "" air bud "" doesn't seem to be interested in anything else .  a friend of mine insists he saw buddy a while back on a segment of david letterman's "" stupid pet tricks .

0|"a few months before the release of star wars episode 1 , the phantom menace , 20th century fox decides to release another space film , that is a complete rip off of star wars .  what is the point of this ?  i do not know , but i wish it hadn't been done , considering wing commander is definitely the year's worst film so far .  to attract people to this horrible movie , they attached the full trailer for the phantom menace .  wing commander will draw large crowds , because this is the only film where you can find the phantom menace full trailer attached at this time .  the trailer for the phantom menace was certainly the best part of the movie experience i had tonight .  many people do not know that wing commander is based on a star wars computer game .  i found this very interesting , considering this fact almost says that wing commander is a star wars movie .  it is nowhere near the level of the star wars films though .  freddie prinze jr . stars in the film as christopher blair .  wing commander was a huge mistake for freddie .  this was definitely his worst performance to date .  after january's she's all that , i actually saw a good actor in freddie , but now all those visions have been crushed .   ( for now anyway . )  christopher blair is a pilot who is a part of the battle to stop the kilrathi , a group that is trying to destroy the earth .  blair's parents also fought in the space battles , and also died there .  his parents were pilgrims , so many people disrespect him because of this .  blair is under the command of "" angel "" , played by saffron burrows , and he is friends with another pilot , todd "" maniac marshall "" , played by matthew lillard .  matthew lillard seems to play the same role in every movie , and he does in this one too .  his character as stu in 1996's scream ( a+ ) , was a great one , but now , it seems like that same role is being played again , only in a space movie .  the three are just a small part of a large group trying to stop the kilrathi before they take over earth .  this plot is very flimsy , and doesn't give a whole lot to work with at all .  this explains why wing commander drags on , seeming like there is no point to any of the events that are going on .  the acting is horrible in wing commander .  many lines seem out of place , and are completely meaningless .  the acting and dialogue was so terrible , i even found myself laughing at it .  the other things which are very bad about wing commander are the special effects and the music .  the special effects are very unrealistic .  when looking at two ships flying side by side , it is simple to tell they are hanging and a blue screen is behind them .  the explosions look very unrealistic as well .  a ship will be blown up , but there will only be fire present four about one half of a second .  this is very unrealistic .  music pretty much accompanies the film the entire time .  the music also felt like video game music , and it was very corny and annoying sounding .  after we are given the plot , the film repeats itself for another hour , without any plot twists , interesting scenes , or anything important to the film .  blair is forced to make jumps over other planets , and he must also fight against the kilrathi aircraft .  for the entire length of the movie , it takes place in space .  it is truly like you are in a video game , because you are just watching people shoot at each other in ships for a long , extended period of time .  it's not much fun to watch at all .  if i wanted to watch people shoot at each other in ships , i would go watch star wars at home .  at least star wars pays attention to people , myth , feelings , and has some real plot to it .  the bottom line- bring on the phantom menace 20th century fox !

0|"bruce willis needs to stay away from straightforward action pictures .  mercury rising adds to a growing list ( including such stinkers as the jackal , last man standing , striking distance and the last boy scout ) of stale actioners he has headlined .  and though mercury rising tries to spice things up by throwing an autistic kid in the mix , it is every bit as stale .  art jeffries ( bruce willis ) is your typical tormented fbi agent .  you know the type , haunted by his job , yet so good at what he does that even physically assaulting another agent merely gets him a slap on the wrist .  enter simon ( miko hughes ) , an autistic boy , who , like rain man and all other autistic people , is a savant .  he can merely gaze at a super-encrypted message , and , while little computer beeps go off in his head , he can understand what it says .  naturally , this talent has brought him to the attention of the federal government .  lt . col . nicholas kudrow ( alec baldwin ) , an nsa official bubbling over with evil , has spent countless time and money implementing the newest "" unbreakable "" code , mercury .  however , when two of his underlings ( robert stanton and bodhi pine elfman ) publish a mercury-encrypted message in a puzzle magazine as a final test of its effectiveness , simon cracks the code .  naturally , this infuriates kudrow , who sends a terminator-like hitman ( l . l .  ginter ) to eliminate the security hazard .  and that's where art jeffries comes in .  for some reason that's never explained in the film , the fbi is called in to help , and through a series of intricate machinations , art becomes the sole protector of the young autistic boy .  in a few unrealistic sequences , he enlists the aid of a stranger , stacey ( kim dickens ) , to help out , but she is given very little to do overall .  the central concept behind mercury rising is ludicrous .  why bother trying to kill the kid . . . i  mean , who would know ?  it's not like the kid ( or anyone else for that matter ) knew he was cracking a government super-cypher .  and even if he is eliminated , what does that help ?  he's already proven that mercury can be broken .  there's always the chance that someone else would crack it . . . but  i guess without a kid in jeopardy , there's not much of a movie here .  for all its faults , the film actually starts relatively well ( once you pass the painfully familiar teaser ) .  the film flirts with developing real characters , and a semblance of a plot . . . then  mr . terminator the hitman appears and everything begins going downhill . . . quickly .  miko hughes does a decent job , for his age , at creating a touching performance .  however , don't go to this film looking for any new insights into autism ( not that many people will ) .  instead he merely becomes the latest unique partner in a routine buddy-cop movie ( think cop and a half . . . with a twist ! )  willis and baldwin are just overplaying to type .  rather than creating a nuanced character , baldwin simply oozes sliminess .  and for willis' part , he simply recycles the stock role of the loner cop/fbi agent ( which he has honed in the die hard series ) .  as almost an afterthought , about halfway through , the film carelessly gives him a character trait ( an addiction ) , and then drops it in the next scene .  but the biggest problem with mercury rising is the screenplay .  this film wasn't well thought out at all .  the film goes to extraordinary lengths to pad in as many convenient coincidences as possible .  the carbon paper scene alone is unworthy of the most gullible audience member .  at first the bad scenes just trickle in , but by the gruesomely bad finale they're a veritable flood .  the film's few decent moments come in the form of bad jokes ( mainly from the geeks who developed the supercode ) .  but they're not nearly enough to make the film worthwhile .  mercury rising is a thriller that you're more likely to groan at than cheer .

0|"capsule : godawful "" comedy "" that's amazingly shabby and cut-rate , and rather bereft of laughs .  i was having a bad week in my life when i saw austin powers : international man of mystery .  i desperately needed something to cheer me up , or at least distract me so i could get a clear head .  get some perspective .  even dumb movies can do that for me , sometimes .  i tried hard not to let my dejection affect my judgment , but i am certain now that austin powers would have also sucked rocks through bamboo shoots on the day i won the lottery .  michael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five-minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film , padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props-strategically-positioned-between-naked-actors-and-camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago .  the plot , what little there is of it : back in the swinging mod hep sixties ( i don't think i'm doing a disservice to the movie's attempted early look and feel by describing it that way ) , sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr . evil .  evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later , when powers was out of the picture .  powers also had himself frozen , and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with .  the basic gag , that of powers' total inability to cope with the nineties , is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with .  the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics : james bond gags ( of which this movie has no end , right down to the silly character names ) , inept slapstick , toilet humor , and strategically placed props . . .  the movie's amazingly bereft of ideas , come to think of it , with a couple of bright exceptions .  one is dr . evil's son -- there is a sidesplitting scene where father and son go to an encounter group , chaired by carrie fisher -- and the other is a throwaway gag where austin mimics various forms of transportation from behind a couch ( it's a visual gag -- hard to describe , and hard to recommend seeing the movie for ) .  a lot of sixties kitsch has been resurrected and thrown on the screen for this movie , but it's desperate rather than clever .  instead of skewering the whole thing , it's a rather bloodless and unfunny tribute .  myers himself is also desperate : he's given an idea to play , not a character .  plus , the attempts to make the character work by giving him a relationship with another sexy ( albeit "" nineties "" ) agent are a waste of time .  i wanted to have the movie end with him trying yet again to get it on with her , only to have her deck him one .  with a couple of exceptions , the movie misses all of its own best moments .  the movie even looks cheesy , and not in a good way : i kept wondering if it had been transferred down from hi-def video or something , so grainy was the film stock in a good many scenes .  the whole thing has the air of being done on the cheap .  my definition of comedy is simply : did it make me laugh ?  the few times that i laughed in austin powers were completely offset by the time i spent cringing and wanting out .  the most damning thing i could say about the movie is that wayne and garth would most likely have shoved it into mike tyson's shorts and sent it sailing .

0|"battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000 , and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close .  in fact , i'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years .  based on the novel by scientology guru l . ron hubbard , battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information .  it's the year 3000 , and an alien race called the psychlos ( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers ) conquered our planet in nine minutes .  ok , we are all of 10 seconds in and i have a zillion questions racing through my mind .  when were we conquered ?  the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1 , 000 years earlier , and if that is the case then we're going to get into a whole bunch of problems later ( trust me . . .  keep reading ) .  also , why don't we get to see earth get conquered ?  how the hell do you make a popcorn sci-fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film ?  humans now live as cavemen or slave labor , and for the film's first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver , colorado .  they grunt and groan and babble about monsters .  so , when the psychlos conquered earth , were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills ?  none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered ( whenever that was ) .  this is definitely not the way to start an action/sci-fi film .  one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster , and he begins to fight it .  the "" monster "" turns out to be a dinosaur from an old miniature golf course .  he turns around and sees all sorts of other characters from the golf course , with some shrubs growing over them .  so , in 1 , 000 years this stupid little golf course has stood the test of time , with only a few weeds growing over it ?  anyway , some of the humans are captured by the psychlos led by terl ( john travolta ) a smarmy and opportunistic alien planning on stealing a recently discovered gold deposit .  the cavemen ( led by barry pepper ) are forced to do their bidding or whatever , but eventually they gain the upper hand and reclaim the planet , or something .  so these cavemen are able to do what earth failed to do 1 , 000 years earlier ?  and , we're supposed to believe that earth was conquered in nine minutes by a group of buffoonish aliens who can't even handle a few cavemen ?  one of the ways the humans reclaim the planet is by taking control of abandoned air force jets and using them to fight the psychlos .  so jets left unattended for 1 , 000 years are still able to fly ?  please , if i leave my car unattended for two weeks i have to replace every fluid and hose under the hood .  why did the psychlos leave jets around anyway ?  shouldn't they have destroyed military installations during their massive nine minute campaign against us ?  the psychlos refer to humans as "" man animals "" but yet dogs are still "" dogs "" .  why aren't they "" dog animals "" ?  the psychlos are after mining earth's precious resources , but for 1 , 000 years are unaware of fort knox ?  why do i even care at this point ?  i'm a fan of travolta's and i'm glad to see he's back on the a-list in hollywood ( despite the fact that he occasionally puts out crowd pleasing dreck like michael and phenomenon ) .  but how did he possibly think this was a good movie ?  and how did he think he was giving a good performance here ?  he's more than capable of making a menacing villain ( see broken arrow and face/off ) but whenever his character came on screen i couldn't hold back my laughter .  now despite the different facial features members of this alien race seem to have , travolta just looks like travolta .  all of the other aliens have weird foreheads or other pointy bones on their face , but travolta just has a goatee .  also , travolta's acts with a sort of phony upper-class snooty accent and constantly whines about bureaucratic nonsense back on his home world .  ooooo , scary villain .  as a producer he should know better and as an actor he should definitely know better .  you can make a dumb but good sci-fi film ( i love independence day for example ) , but there is absolutely nothing entertaining about battlefield earth .  i did everything i possibly could to stay awake during the screening . . .  i cleaned my glasses , walked around the theater , made a grocery list , chose my lottery numbers for the week , replayed super bowl xxv in my head ( with commercials ) . . .  and still was compelled to scrutinize the insides of my eyelids .  by the time we actually reach the year 3000 , people should still be avoiding this film .  folks , save your cash . .  don't go see it , don't rent it , and don't buy it .  you'd be more entertained by taking the money you'd use for this movie and just throwing it into the wind , watching it sail away ( hell , send it to us here at the jacksonville film journal . . .  we'll entertain you plenty with that kind of money ) .  unless of course you're just captivated by countless slow motion shots of barry pepper running , which is just about all you'll come away with from this movie .  that , and a headache .

""  i despise how he never gets a bruise in any of his fights .  i hate how every single plot twist leads to just a melodramatic fight between he and the chief villain .  i hate his non-satirical messages ( in the beginning of this one , he slaps on a quote from arthur miller , which has nothing to do with the film , except it's about brooklyn where this film takes place ) .  and i hate how he's so narcissistic that he thinks that he can actually fucking sing ( during the end credits , he has a good old hill billy rock tune sung and penned by him ) .  sure , the guy's probably a nice guy in person ( i actually found him very non-threatening when he was on letterman not too long ago ) .  but the guy makes worse films than reagan did .  so what's the plot of this shit-terpiece ?  well . . . something  about him trying to catch a stupid-ass crook ( william forsythe ) who shot and killed his partner in broad daylight .  i couldn't believe how bad this scene was - the guy was conveniently with his family so we get the maximum emotional effect ( ahem ! ) .  and forsythe even said some stupid lines to him before he took off .  i'm sorry , did anyone ever hear of concealing one's self ?  so in comes ex-brooklynite seagal , who dedicates his life to catching this guy .  and i just wished he had caught him in the beginning , then ended the film .  but noooo , this drags on , as he bullies forsythe's family members ( including a stupid bar-owner , and none other than gina gershon as his other bar-owner sister ) .  and forsythe more than once threatens his family .  at one point , he actually comes to their house and stalks them like a non-threatening nicholson in "" the shining "" ( complete with them all hiding in the bathroom , but with an added bonus of one girl conveniently loosing her cool and screaming to give them away ) .  seagal paints himself as a lovable person , with a son , and a fiancee .  he even shows him hanging with his son , checking up on his homework , and then about to take him out for a bit of "" catch , "" when he's conveniently called away on assignment .  i dunno about you , but playing "" catch "" with seagal was one of my childhood nightmares .  he also shows him as that bad-ass he wants to be , with scenes of him bullying crooks around , and taking out people who are stupid enough to attack him even after he's unarmed a chinese guy swinging bats with a pool cue .  serves them right .  this film , as some of his do , has an interesting supporting cast of actors who are actually talented , but don't appear to be in this film .  i already mentioned gina gershon ( who's pretty horrible in this one ) , as well as william forsythe , who over-acts terribly .  i know this guy can act : he was awesome in "" raising arizona "" as goodman's partner in crime .  but he's just awful here .  jerry orbach gives the only credible performance in the film as the police chief who checks up on segal after things have gone down .  why is he the only one who gives a good performance ?  well , because his role is small enough and sporadic enough to not tarnish his credibility .  he seems to be in here just to give it a cool "" law and order "" feeling ( even if it's not a "" cool "" feeling ) .  and in cameos are b-rated erotic-thriller-cinemax-style stars , shannon whirry ( as "" terry malloy , "" which is more of a bad joke than a clever one ) and athena massey .  oh !  and "" er "" 's julliana margiulles has two scenes .   "" out for justice "" just proves once again that american action films just suck .  i know that there's such a good thing as good action - he's called john woo .  but if you're in the mood for some good old no-brainer , fun-yet-dumb action , don't bother watching this .  it's so stupid that it's boring .

0|vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico .  the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow ( james woods ) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out .  while the initial imagery is a little over-dramatic , it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence .  that is enough action to last us a while and we could , director john carpenter would let us , get to a story line .  but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene .  then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that .  the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end .  and that is something of a pity because the film , based on the book vampire$ by john steakley , gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery .  this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film , but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it .  what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires .  there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore .  anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans .  this has not always been carpenter's style .  his 1981 version of the thing has action but also challenges the viewer to do a little thinking about the film's central science fictional question .  jack crow heads a vampire swat team , cleaning up nests of vampires with high-tech spears and crossbows .  in the early part of the film his team is wiped out by a particularly mean vampire valek ( thomas ian griffith ) who has been tipped off to who crow is .  now crow team is gone and he is down to himself and his sidekick tony montoya ( daniel baldwin ) .  to make matters worse , he does not know the people on his own side , tony and his backers , he can trust .  meanwhile jack is sure the vampires are looking for something that must be hidden somewhere here in new mexico .  if this is sounding like a very tired police corruption plot with a few obvious substitutions , that's exactly what it is .  the same story looks just as well with two partner cops looking for a gang of hood who are themselves looking for a packet of heroin .  but carpenter goes against a familiar principle of film : show people , don't tell them .  just about everything in the plot other than the fights we are told about in the dialog and not shown .  fundamental questions in the plot like where does crow get his funding , why are the vampires in new mexico--what do they want and why do they want it , what is the connection of the vampires and the catholic church , how did crow come to be a vampire hunter and why devote his life to it ?  the answers to any of these questions could have been dramatized , but instead are revealed through dialog .  now if all this was not bad enough , carpenter misuses the james wood persona .  woods plays a particular sort of cool lowlife very well .  but carpenter leads off the film by having woods do some sergio-leone- style mythic posturing .  while his crew prepares for an attack he stands staring fixedly through shades at the house that will be his target .  woods does not work as a larger than life mythic hero .  that is not his style and it just does not work very well .  there are some simple things that carpenter should be looking for as director that he misses .  in one scene we are looking at a motel room with dead people on the floor .  one female corpse is on the floor in front of a chair so that there is about an inch of daylight between her and the chair .  as the actress breathes the gap widening and narrowing makes it obvious her arm is moving up and down .  one also wonders how the existence of vampires is kept secret .  these vampires do not maintain a low profile .  there are arguably logical flaws in the film .  there is some question in my mind whether carpenter has a consistent policy on what effect bullets have on vampires .  it would take some rationalization to explain why in some scenes sunlight has a dramatic effect on vampires , yet in a scene toward the end a vampire can walk under a burned roof that lets him be swept by beams of sunlight .  i suspect that the book on which this film was based was better thought out .  while i might recommend this film to an action audience i would say that what i look for in a vampire film vampires rates a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  perhaps i will read the book .  |-0.3833333333333333|0.8333333333333334|0.8333333333333334|"The overall sentiment towards the film ""Vampires"" is slightly positive, with a moderate level of confidence.

0|"when considering david fincher's latest film , "" the game "" , four words come to mind .   "" don't believe the hype . ""  this michael douglas vehicle , from the director of "" seven "" , isn't nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful as it would have us believe .  the film draws us in with an intriguing concept ( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer ) where a jaded millionaire ( douglas ) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy .  this isn't simply virtual reality .  this is real life with a deadly twist .  on his 48th birthday , nicholas van orton ( douglas ) is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother , conrad ( sean penn ) .  conrad has a special birthday present for his brother .  he hands nicholas a gift certificate and tells him to contact a company called consumer recreation services .   "" they make your life fun , "" conrad tells him .  nicholas humors his brother , telling him he'll call , but it's clear he has no time for any foolish , "" fantasy role-playing , "" as he calls it .  then , for reasons that are never really made clear , nicholas decides to go to crs and see what they're all about .  he ends up spending a whole day going through their screening process , which to me made no sense considering the tight schedule he keeps claiming to have .  nevertheless , when it seems nicholas has been rejected as a crs client , the weird things start happening .  of course , when we've only covered about 30 minutes of screen time , what else should we expect .  douglas has built his modern career around playing powerful , violent and unlikable men being manipulated by unseen hands .  one of those films , "" basic instinct "" , came from the creative minds of writer , joe eszterhas and director , paul verhoeven .  the premise of "" the game , "" is not unlike the concept of another verhoeven film , "" total recall . ""  in that case , the premise was implanting someone else's memories as a way to enhance one's own life through a dream vacation .  yet , in both films , the real goal is to create a vicarious bond with the audience .  we live the adventure along with the protagonist , reacting to each twist and turn .  in theory , the key to the suspense is not being to tell what is real and what isn't .  all we can do is hang on until the end of the ride , when the truth is finally revealed .  now , for those of you who forgot , let me say this again .   "" don't believe the hype . ""   "" the game "" is not a thrilling roller coaster ride .  as a suspense-thriller , it doesn't do much but spin in circles .  by the third reel , i was fighting back sleep and checking my watch as i endured the predictable plot .  is it any wonder douglas won't be able to resist the charms of a mysterious , potentially life-threatening blonde ( ever heard of glenn close ?  no ? well , how about sharon stone ?  thought so ) .  if anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven't seen that many films .  there is no suspense here .  trust me , i looked hard to find some .  i had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations .  fincher aim's for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas .  there are those that might say "" the game "" is not intended to be viewed literally .  i would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film .  the film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues .  there is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who's in on the whole thing .  he is charged by his paranoia .  he is looking at the world through new eyes .  it is the last thought-provoking moment in the film .  from there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us .  any significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device .  at the outset , we're told each "" game "" is tailored to the individual .  ultimately , this "" game "" is supposed to work like a crucible , trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire , proving his soul .  yet , as douglas endures his personal gauntlet , we're given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is .  i wanted to like this film more than i did .  i look at it as just anothergreat idea , poorly realized .  i can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn't mean we were seeing what was really happening .  bryan singer's "" the usual suspects "" for one , a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas .  also , there is the underrated "" jacob's ladder , "" with tim robbins , a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism .  here are two examples of films that don't simply manipulate for manipulations' sake .  there are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place .  one major issue that comes up in "" the game "" is whether or not the whole "" illusion "" is just a highly sophisticated con game .  well , i can tell you right now , after you've spent your $7 dollars , you may be asking yourself the same thing .

0|"weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg's reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches .  there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics .  spielberg's greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story .  but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken .  in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films .  _saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a "" pr mission "" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day .  ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers .  the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france .  there's no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie .  the equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done .  the opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat .  another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg's brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops .  the technical side of the film is peerless , as always .  the camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw .  hanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel .  yet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events .  it has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince .  throughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) .  for example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground .  here and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there's an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man .  but the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact .  there are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) .  the relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film .  ultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war .  rather than saying _saving private ryan_ is "" realistic , "" it would be better to describe it as "" having realistic moments . ""  another aspect of the "" hollywoodization "" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing .  anyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell's superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup .   "" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? ""  asks one infantrymen in the group of eight .  rendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as "" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? ""  or some variant thereof .  conversations should have been literally sprinkled with the "" f "" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex .  this is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an "" r "" rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film .  however , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic .  the most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg .  he cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it .  as if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler's list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler's monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller's last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain .  that particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film .  nowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) .  because of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows .   .

0|"if you're going to make a two-hour hollywood in-joke , why bother releasing it to the general public ?  if you're going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big-name actors and people who know woody allen , then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters ?  while watching celebrity , i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people .  what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self-deprecation .  celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself , living in a world that he's familiar with , dealing with people like the ones he actually knows .  allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture , in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more .  branagh plays lee simon , a journalist-turned-screenwriter who divorces his wife , robin ( judy davis ) , shacks up with some hot women ( famke janssen , charlize theron , winona ryder ) , and goes about trying to get big stars ( melanie griffith , leonardo dicaprio ) to read his script about an armored car robbery .  the usual elements of recent allen films are all here , including the sexual insecurity of the main character , lots of self-loathing women , and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another .  unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally , it's not likely that you'll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity .  aside from all the in-jokes , the story falls far short of compelling , and the characters are all empty and lifeless .  branagh proves once again that he's a superb performer , nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly .  the problem is that he's the same character allen always plays , a character who's getting more than a little dull to watch .  i mean , come on , how many times have you seen this guy ?  -- he hates his work , and he can't be satisfied by any one woman , and , at the end of the movie , nothing has been solved .  he brings all of his problems upon himself ( crashing his car because he's receiving fellatio , and other such stunts ) , so it's pretty hard to care about him .  in addition , isn't allen capable of creating characters who aren't just like him ?  i know he is , but he didn't do it in celebrity .  the vacant emotional attachment with the main character is not recaptured in the supporting performances .  davis , playing the same woman with low self-esteem that she played in deconstructing harry , has a few touching moments , but ends up the same despicable celebrity-type that fills the rest of the movie .  some of the actresses are saved because of their beauty -- theron and ryder , especially -- but they're not likable people .  only famke janssen , as a book editor interested in simon's new novel , has any life .  the men in the picture don't do much better -- joe mantegna is pretty dull as the man who remarries robin , while dicaprio , as a christian slater/johnny depp-type spoiled young actor , is funny but disengaging .  what's really insulting about celebrity is how dull and standard its "" themes "" are .  allen seems to think that he's making an insightful movie about the way "" normal "" people look at celebrities .  the main problem with this is that the character with whom we're supposed to identify , simon , is not a "" normal "" guy -- he's just as entrenched in the hollywood image as the rest of the characters .  the other problem is that the image we get of these celebrities is no more enlightening than the view the media gives us -- none of them register as realistic , interesting characters ; they mostly just function as set pieces for boring dialogue .  in addition , allen decides he needs a scene in which the theme is expressed explicitly ( robin , in this scene , says something like , "" it's interesting to see the way we all look at the people we celebrate ! "" ) .  celebrity is arguably allen's biggest misfire to date .  it does have a few good scenes -- theron's super-orgasmic model character is kind of funny , and the last scene might have been moving had the rest of the film shown us a character or two .  but celebrity is a failure at the core , unless allen's point was to make a self-indulgent movie about himself and his friends .  if he wanted to make his audience feel like they were on the outside of a big joke , then he succeeded in that .  i , for one , don't enjoy feeling like an outsider .

0|it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire .  usually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein .  to qualify , you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat .  but today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you .  by the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors .  not in these times .  all you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade .  without sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity .  which brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half .  not only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after-hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower .  with all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims .  you also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry-cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains .  blade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual .  the plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost .  it's all hokum and nonsense , of course .  but the filmmakers play it straight .  unfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings .  you know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter .  another tell-tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero's costume more than the hero .  also it seems it's not enough for today's vampire merely to have fangs .  he must also be proficient in the martial arts .  why a supernatural being , one of the undead , needs such skills is beyond me .   ( of course , this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films-run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires , in which dracula is defeated by seven karate-chopping siblings . )  wesley snipes is buff as blade .  he growls his lines -the few he has - and spends most of the time glowering - as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co-producing this turkey .  blade is just another example of how the vampire film , a once honorable member of the horror family , has gone downhill .  this dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face .  today's vampires lack the panache , the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee .  they are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers' capes .  they are more farcical than frightful .  this whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening .  |-0.8000000000000002|0.9333333333333332|0.8333333333333334|The explanations agree that the text has a negative sentiment because it criticizes the modern portrayal of vampires in movies, expressing disappointment in their lack of exclusivity and style, and a diminished fear factor.

0|"it seems that i've stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch .  take payback , for example , a movie that most people seem to like .  however , it's horrible schlock , straight out of hollywood's vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies .  it was written and directed by a guy who should have done better ; however , maybe he did do better , after all , 30 percent of the movie isn't his own .  mel gibson , that hollywood zombie , decided he didn't like the ending and had another director reshoot it .  what a crock .  if you sign on to do a movie , then do it the way the script calls for .  why film a movie and then look at it later and say , - no , i changed my mind , i don't like the ending .  you're fired .  let's get someone else to do it .  - i suppose honor is dead in hollywood .  the end of the film is , of course , hollywoodized .  which is to say that it's happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize .  in this case , as is most victories in hollywood movies , gibson's prize is a blond and money .  i miss originality in film , i really do .  i think audiences are so starved for it that they'll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original .  payback's tagline - get ready to root for the bad guy - promised an original idea , but it was far from the truth .  while gibson's character certainly broke the law , he was a character that had honor ( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it ) , wouldn't kill in front of children and protects his blond woman .  there's nothing bad about him - he's a hollywood character , a person who could never exist in real life .  and gibson knows it - he spends his time trying to act like a "" bad guy "" , and instead comes off as pretentious and arrogant .  the story involves gibson being double-crossed by his partner ( who is a real bad guy , which made me wish that we could root for him ) over $70 , 000 .  gibson recovers from multiple gunshots , is pissed ( naturally ) , and will do whatever it takes to get the exact amount of money back - no more , no less .  he makes a point of it that it's strictly 70 grand .  a real bad guy would have made his ex-partner pay 25% interest .  this idea is completely stretched out .  gibson ends up going after his partner and the chicago mafia that his partner is affiliated with .  what i didn't understand - this is the chicago mafia .  $70 , 000 is like spare change to them .  they'd probably just pay the guy rather than go through the trouble of dealing with him .  i think they'd respect a guy going through this much trouble for a simple $70 , 000 .  maybe i'm being too hard on the movie .  perhaps the filmmakers were just trying to make a simple popcorn movie .  i read roger ebert's review and he liked gibson in the role because he is a comic at heart playing a bad guy .  that's why we're allowed to root for him .  and it's true - gibson walks the movie as if he's smiling at a joke he just heard .  but he's wrong here .  i wanted a lee marvin or old-time clint eastwood or somebody who wasn't a comic , just an ass kicker .  as a side note , i've just checked the internet movie database and discovered that i am the 38th person to post a newsgroup review of payback .  after this many reviews , why would anyone want to read this ?  really , i don't care .  i'm just trying to gain membership into the on-line film critics society by posting as many reviews as i can .

0|"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .   "" quick , robin !  the anti-shark repellant ! ""  - adam west in the 1966 batman feature film , casually kicking at a pathetic-looking rubber shark attached to his leg  i had never thought that an entry in the modern incarnation of the batman feature film would approach this level of campiness , but in many instances batman and robin nears , and at some point even exceeds this standard .  this is a disasterously bad film , easily the worst in the series to date , and fairly epitomizes a cinematic definition of the word excessive - it's loud , garish , and obnoxious , with pointless , gratuitous action sequences and set pieces which clutter up the screen with elaborate production design to the point of overkill .  batman and robin features the caped crusaders ( george clooney debuting as batman , with chris o'donnell returing as robin ) squaring off against another bevy of chemically-induced villains - the nefarious ice-cold mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) , armed with a weapon which freezes everything in its sights , and the slinky poison ivy ( uma thurman ) , who has the ability to blow powerful love dust into the faces of men in order so that they will fall helplessly in love with her ( not that the dust is really necessary to accomplish this result , but whatever ) , and then dispatch them with a poisoned kiss .  by ivy's side is the giant steroid monster bane ( jeep swanson ) , a grunting hulk of a beast .  the villains' goals are noble ones - freeze steals diamonds to power his climate suit ( in order to keep his body temperature at zero degrees ) , so that he can survive in order to devise a cure for his beloved wife ( vendela ) , dying of a degenerative disease and frozen in suspended animation , and ivy's intent is to restore the dominance of plant life on earth , albeit by destroying all human life .  meanwhile , on the homefront , life at wayne manor is thrown into upheaval by the illness of butler alfred pennyworth ( michael gough ) , and the arrival of his niece barbara ( alicia silverstone ) .  akiva goldsman's screenplay for the film is ridiculous and laughably bad , with astonishingly terrible dialogue , lame jokes , and an awful by-the-number plot which simply coasts along and fails to generate any genuine excitement .  it makes goldsman's screenplay of batman forever , which i thought was dreadful , look positively inspired in comparison .  i am still astonished that a cheesy plot device which i'd seen used in - no joke - an episode of gilligan's island somehow make its way into a multimillion dollar blockbuster production .  joel schumacher's direction of batman and robin is horrific , with a terrible balance of flashiness over substance .  there is a clear conceit towards neon in this film , even moreso than with his previous batman forever , with the revamped batcave helpfully sporting gigantic glowing emblems for the dynamic duo ( just in case , i suppose , if they ever happen to forget that the batcave is the headquarters of batman and robin ) , and with neon prominently figuring in an utterly-pointless fight sequence with bane and a street gang over ivy's chosen new abode .  another action sequence which fails to serve any useful point other than to chew up five minutes of screentime involves an incredibly uninvolving late-night motorcycle race with barbara and some gotham goons .  mr . schumacher's focus for batman and robin appears to be to make the film as visually striking as possible , to the detriment of the story - there are drastic shifts in the tone of the film between all-out camp and heartfelt drama , with the latter completely unconvincing and ineffective .  it is perhaps not the most promising of signs when the group i was with burst out laughing within twenty seconds of the film's opening , even before a single line of dialogue had been uttered .  is batman and robin supposed to be campy ?  i think it is - it's hard to imagine that the filmmakers could have intended many parts of the film to be taken at all seriously .   ( one of my favourites was when bane helpfully grunted "" bomb ! ""  each time he laid down an explosive device in the gotham observatory . )  is it supposed to be as overly campy as it turned out to be ?  i somehow doubt it - the subplot involving afred is delivered so solemnly and with such graveness that the impression is made that the film isn't attempting to be the utter farce which it is .  arnold schwarzenegger is top-billed in the film as the villainous mr . freeze , and is bland and uninteresting , perhaps the worst thing that a villain can be .  mr . schwarzenegger's attempts to be menacing are laughable , and his attempts at conveying pathos are laughable ; frankly , everything he does onscreen is laughable .  by the end of the film , i was stifling a chuckle every time he simply appeared onscreen .  the bulk of his performance consists of uttering near-unintelligble puns and one-liners featuring every possible permutation of "" cool ! ""  in the least inventive way .  george clooney has been given very little to do in batman and robin , being overshadowed by the villains , and consequently he looks rather uncomfortable in the film .  his batman is hardly an imposing figure .  chris o'donnell is unimpressive in a one-note performance , while alicia silverstone lackadasically fails to make any impression at all .  the film's one saving grace ?  undoubtably uma thurman's entertaining performance as sexy villainess poison ivy .  her work in batman and robin is certainly over-the-top , but in a controlled fashion which works splendidly within the tone of the film .  ms . thurman's comic timing is impeccable , and reminds us that it takes skilled performers to make campiness work successfully .   ( i'm already starting to positively reassess jim carrey's performance in batman forever . )  her amusing poison ivy is the most entertaining character in the film , and when she's offscreen the film greatly suffers .  i figure that if one has to die , being kissed to death by uma thurman isn't a half-bad way to go .  while batman and robin was hardly a ride of pulse-pounding excitement , i must admit that i was not bored watching it , although i did glance at my watch repeatedly through the screening - my attention was kept through anticipation of the utterance of yet another terrible pun or one-liner , and by awaiting yet another scene to fall flat .  it's been a long time since i've laughed so much at a movie .   "" at "" , of course , is the operative word .

0|"everything about this ninth trek movie seems on the cheap , from the roger corman-grade special effects to its highly derivative and ugly ad campaign ( the poster is nearly identical to that of star trek vi : the undiscovered country ) .  but piller's not-quite-half-baked screenplay should ultimately claim responsibility for insurrection's failure .  i'm about to give the same advice to rick berman and co .  as i've given to the financiers of james bond movies : it's time to breathe life into this workhorse by hiring solid genre writers and a real director .   ( while we're at it , put that visor back on laforge ! )  for three hundred years , the ba'ku species ( who look just like humans ) have lived on a ringed-planet that might as well be called the fountain of youth .  six hundred of them occupy the briar patch , the area affected by metaphasic radition , a positive energy that reverses the aging process in the elderly .  but evil ru'afo ( this is probably abraham's last stop before performing "" amadeus "" at a dinner theatre near you ) , leader of the son'a ( who look just like burn victims after reconstructive surgery ) , wants to relocate the ba'ku and movie his people onto the briar patch in their place , in order to replenish his dying breed .  the federation is all for this , but picard feels this is a direct violation of the prime directive : to not interfere with the development of an alien race .   ( never mind that the ba'ku didn't exactly evolve-they went wandering in the universe one day and stumbled upon the magic world . )  every time frakes gives an interview lately , he seems to top whatever ludicrous statement he last gave regarding this installment .  he has called it a comedy , a thinking man's picture , a throwback to the old series , and , most grievously , he has likened it to a john ford western .   ( i presume that's some john ford he went to school with , not the director of the searchers . )  he has also gone on record as saying paramount recut the film from his version .  that's no excuse-someone generated this footage .  muddy cinematography and sitcom sets are the least of its problems ; star trek : insurrection appears to have been beamed in from the planet plotholia .  consider such curiosities . . .  picard's love interest , anij ( donna murphy ) , can slow things down by staring at them ( such as a waterfall or falling rocks ) -her scientific explanation for this ?   "" don't ask . ""  worf gets a pimple ( he's re-experiencing klingon puberty thanks to the time-defying atmosphere ) , laforge regains his eyesight ( trust me , levar burton's real eyes are scarier than those electronic lenses he wore in first contact ) and troi brags about her firm boobs , but picard remains as bald as an android's butt .  most suspiciously , what exactly is the problem with letting this endangered race have a little fun in the sun ?  the filmmakers cloud the issue with some nonsense about a family feud of sorts , and they also turn ru'afo into a completely power-mad superfreak , just so the characters will have something to do in the climax .   ( and if you've seen return of the jedi , you've seen the ending of this movie . )  didn't picard himself previously disobey the prime directive when he prevented the borg from assimilating millions ?  frakes lucked out with first contact , and repeat viewings of that film reveal the seeds of what went wrong in his direction of insurrection : he has no sense of comic timing , and he mines for acting chemistry where none exists .   ( take a look at the painful "" troi gets drunk "" scene in fc and you'll get the general idea of insurrection's unsuccessfully jokey and hollow tone . )  even the worst shatner and co .  treks , like the final frontier , maintained a watchability thanks to the effortless , charming comaraderie between kirk , spock , and bones .  neither first contact nor insurrection has any idea what to do with crusher ( gates mcfadden , whom i must say maintains a fabulous physique ) , troi , or laforge .  and all three next generation films spend too much time on data , who is the franchise's answer to urkel .  need a cheap laugh ?  have data say something sexual , or start singing , or lift up a four hundred pound boulder as if it's the hunk of styrofoam it really is .  here's my proposed title for number 10 : data star data trek : data data data data data .  in this movie , data will become preoccupied with learning to blow his nose , while crusher and troi watch silently from 500 yards away and laforge points his sinister gaze at the android in doubly robotic observation .  star trek : insurrection had one nice , eerie , silent moment that hints at a better , darker film .  i'm not saying all of them should be star trek ii : the wrath of khan , but this one boldly went where no movie should go again .

0|"this is one of the worst big-screen film experiences i've had for a while .  with this film , plus `showgirls' and `basic instinct' , paul verhoeven has stamped himself as currently one of the worst blockbuster directors .  his celebrated film `total recall' was ? i admit ? successfully scripted , but it nonetheless contained directorial flaws .  obviously nobody wanted to invest too much money in a production from someone like verhoeven , the result being that much of the special effects in `starship' seemed fake .  but not everything bad in the film was the director's fault , even though he was one of the guys who employed the actors .  it is surprising that none of the actors received nominations for the razzie awards ( i expected five for the acting categories ) .  casserole vanity devoid , dense ribald , dingy miasma , and jackass bushy are in serious need of acting school .  no , they have to pass primary school drama classes first .  while `total' was written well , `starship' is purely pathetic .  all right , it is supposed to be a fast-paced entertainment film , and you're supposed to turn off your intellect ( completely ) and enjoy the action sequences and special effects ( that is , guts and gore ) .  as a matter of fact , i found the activity incredibly boring , a complete waste of more than two hours .  half of the film was a bad episode of `beverly hills 90210' ( dina meyer was in "" beverly hills "" ) , while another quarter was simply nothing ( things like presenting irrelevant information in an irritating way on the web ) , and the rest was a display of humans fighting computer-generated images .  the battles were all the same ? jumping around , shoot or get stabbed ? and on barren planets that only had giant insects .  there weren't even any stunts , which i consider slightly more exciting than pictures running around .  i wonder what the insects eat , if there's nothing but them on the planets ?  there is so much laughable treatment in this film , and it is frankly not amusing when jokes are intended .  this type of story is obviously aimed at 10-year-olds , who can't see it anyway because of the violence and some sexuality .  but then , there are always 16-year-olds who have that frame of mind .  the pointless plot begins when johnny's ( vanity devoid ) girlfriend carmen ( richards ) decides that she wants to join the troopers to fight the insects who are throwing asteroids at earth .  johnny then signs up as a trooper also , after an overacted argument with his parents .  but there is another girl , dizzy ( meyer ) , who likes johnny and then there is another boy who likes carmen , which results in a love quadrangle , which isn't better , because it means augmented worse-than-stereotyped soap opera , increased bitchiness , and more bad beverly hills + melrose .  and the result of this love quadrangle at the end is also rather stupid .  anyway , getting back to the thing you might call plot , johnny is too stupid to be a pilot and has to join the infantry , while his girl and the other dude are in the same league .  dizzy comes chasing johnny and joins the infantry also .  they then start training , which contains what roger ebert calls ips ( idiot plot syndrome , moments when only an idiot would have made such obvious mistakes ) , then real combat .  and guess what ?  that's about as complex as it gets .  oh , and one of their friends , carl ( neil patrick harris a . k . a . doogie howser m . d . ) , becomes involved in war intelligence , and his abilities at the end are really corny and make me want to spray insecticide on someone for it .  he's my fifth nom for a razzie .  the troopers fight , fall in love , die , kill , and try to act .  naturally , they win , or sort of half-win .  of course , in between ( and at the end ) there are soldiers chatting and smiling while carrying grievous wounds caused by bug legs .  the bugs also suffer from ips : why would you release hold of your captive before killing it ?  isn't it also amazing that earthlings haven't invented better hand-held weapons by then ?  the only question that remains is why i gave it one star instead of zero .  well , maybe a-quarter ( of a star ) for the originality of the co-sex shower scene and the ( very ) brief moments of suspense , another quarter for copying `zulu' and letting the good guys ( the bugs ) win , and half a star for the sucking-out of the brain of one of those people who call themselves actors ( but there should have been more , the troopers deserved to die ) .

0|phew , what a mess !  for his fifth collaboration with director rich- ard donner ( lethal weapon i-iii , maverick ) , mel gibson plays a motormouth , maybe mentally ill new york city cabbie , jerry , whose wild conspiracy theories are all but ignored by alice ( julia roberts , acting all serious ) , the justice department employee that he has a crush on .  she not interested , but another person is : a cia psychiatrist ( patrick stewart ) who promptly kidnaps him .  is one of jerry's conjectures correct ?   * is * the metal strip in the new $100 bill being used to track your movements ?  is oliver stone still alive , because he cut a deal with george bush to spread * dis * information ?  is this movie really about * any * of the crazed cabbie's theories ?  no , no , and no .  as it turns out , there's some other nonsense going on here , involving and revolving around jerry's background .

0|"it happens every year -- the days get longer , the weather gets warmer and the studios start releasing their big-budget blockbusters .  this year's crop already seems inferior to that of past summers , even 1997's lackluster trio of batman & robin , the fifth element and the lost world .  the marketing blitz in 1998 has been centered on godzilla ( "" heeere , lee-zerd , lee-zerd . . . "" ) , which doesn't make me optimistic about future summers .  godzilla is , of course , based on a series of cult movies ( translation : really bad movies only a few people can tolerate ) from japan that turn up really late at night on ted turner-owned cable stations .  that this big-budget remake won't rise above its roots is fairly obvious .  the credits show us the origin of godzilla .  in five words : nuclear explosion creates giant lizard .  sounds like an enquirer headline , doesn't it ?  the mushroom cloud is followed by the inevitable "" discovery "" sequence .  this time , a japanese guy is eating noodles with chopsticks while watching sumo wrestling ( if that ain't a stereotype . . . )  when he discovers the telltale radar blip .  people die .  cut to our protagonist , played by matthew broderick .  he makes his first appearance wearing headphones , warbling along to "" singin' in the rain . ""  it's a none-too-subtle sign that he wishes he were in a classier movie .  no dice , bueller .  from the beginning , poor matthew has to do embarassing things like fondle giant earthworms and stand in godzilla's enormous footprint .  every disaster movie has to have a know-it-all scientist , and this time broderick is it .  as the world's leading expert on radiated earthworms ( and wouldn't you love to have that printed on your business card ? ) ,  broderick is invaluable to the government .  he immediately dispels vicki lewis' theory that godzilla is a dinosaur because , hey , you can't take seriously the intellectual arguments of "" newsradio "" cast members .  broderick instead hits the nail on the head , announcing godzilla is a radiated lizard .   "" the radiation isn't an anamoly , "" he announces , and lightning strikes .   "" i believe this is a mutated abberation , "" he continues , and lightning strikes again .  it's vocabulary lightning , you see , activated by words of four syllables or more .  meanwhile , we're introduced to our new york cast , headed by an ambitious broadcast journalist ( maria patillo ) , broderick's former love .  gee , what are the odds their paths will cross again at a dramatically important time ?  poor patillo has been trying to get ahead in the news business for years but has been held down by heartless anchorman harry shearer .  italian cameraman hank azaria tells her she's not ruthless enough : "" nice doesn't get you anywhere in this town .  it's dog eat dog . ""  actually , it's lizard eat city , as godzilla emerges from the atlantic to begin a rampage on the big apple's core .  the filmmakers provide us with a one-note drunk fisherman who hooks godzilla .   "" i think i've got a bite , "" he announces as a gigantic tidal wave begins rushing toward him .  you can guess what happens next .  similar reactions spring forth as the monster prowls the city .  hearing the rumble of approaching footsteps , one new yorker remarks , "" please don't tell me that's another parade . ""  please don't tell me that's the best line you could come up with .  mayor ebert is not pleased .  played by the principal from "" head of the class , "" he continually makes the wrong decision when given an option , and bickers with his assistant gene .  i guess the filmmakers knew they'd be getting two thumbs down from the critics and didn't even bother to kiss ass .  the problem is , if you're going to attack siskel and ebert , you should at least make it funny .  dialogue like , "" didn't we agree that we weren't going to have any sweets until after the election ? ""  followed by , "" back off , gene , "" just doesn't work for me .  other lame running jokes include everyone mispronouncing the broderick character's last name and frenchman jean reno's inability to find a good cup of coffee in new york .  there's even more fun to be had as godzilla progresses .  as the beast heads back into hiding , broderick suggests the military lure it out with food .  cue twelve dump trucks , all dropping fish into a new york intersection .   ( broderick : that's a lot of fish . )  that ambush fails , but broderick soon figures out why godzilla came to new york by buying $50 worth of home pregnancy tests and running lizard blood through them .  yep , godzilla's with children , which makes you wonder just what kind of creature would be horny enough to have sex with godzilla .  that's until broderick explains that godzilla reproduces asexually , like linda tripp .  godzilla comes to us from the makers of independence day , so it has a lot of dumb action scenes , destructive special effects and shallow subplots .  look no further than patillo's betrayal of broderick ( patillo : what have i done , animal ?  what have i become ? ) and the climactic "" godzilla's nest "" sequence in madison square garden .  the main difference is , independence day was about the experience .  it had a real global , patriotic element to it , and some genuinely fun characters .  godzilla has lots of rain and lightning , reptilian action ripped off from jurassic park and endless product placement from the likes of kodak , blockbuster , juicy fruit , swatch , sprint and bumble bee tuna .  yes , bumble bee actually paid to be known as the official tuna of godzilla .  that fact alone is twice as interesting as anything in the movie .

0|it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it's stars , roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70 .  mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood , having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films .  fright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles .  this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was .  william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us .   ( at least in the movies anyway . )  it has been several years since charlie brewster ( ragsdale ) and b-movie actor turned late night horror film host , peter vincent ( mcdowall ) came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie's next door neighbor .  charlie and peter won that battle , but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family .  apparently charlie's former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling .  so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge .  this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again .  one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie's stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood .  fright night part 2 tries to duplicate that modern style but it falls sort .  while they are stylish , the vamps in this film just don't have the personality of the undead in the first film .  with the exception of a werewolf who adds some much needed comic relief to a few of the scenes .  one bright spot , speaking from a strictly sexist point of view , is traci lin , who plays charlie's very skeptical girlfriend .  it's really a shame that her career hasn't been better since she made this film .  ragsdale does a fair job in this film , but doesn't give nearly the performance that he did in the original .  roddy mcdowall makes the most with what he is given , which unfortunately isn't much which is a shame because his character was a lot of fun in the original movie .  i guess i would have to say that the first film was a superior product in every way .  the original always left you feeling danger was lurking right around the corner , part 2 had more of the feel of a music video .  never a good thing for a horror film .  another minus for part 2 was the traditional scenes that leave the audience on the edge of their seats waiting for something to jump out of a shadow where very rare .  for that matter , they were almost nonexistent .  if i was going to watch a horror film , this would be far from my first choice .  the first fright night , on the other hand , would be right up near the top of my list .  if i was in the mood for a roddy mcdowall film i'd probably head to the science fiction section of my local video store and rent planet of the apes .  either way fright night part 2 would most likely not enter into the equation .  |-0.5666666666666667|0.9|0.7666666666666666|"The overall sentiment is negative as the author expresses disappointment with ""Fright Night Part 2"", comparing it unfavorably to the first film, noting the lack of danger, suspense, and interesting vampire characters, as well as expressing sadness over the death of Roddy McDowall."
