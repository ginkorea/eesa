0|"you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year .  they're obviously films for which the studios have no great hopes ( having missed both the deadline for academy award eligibility and the big box-office holiday season ) .  combine that with howie long's first starring action role , and you've got a doozy of a movie that , while not as bad as it could have been , isn't a very good film .  howie stars as an ace smokejumper ( a firefighter who parachutes into forest fires unreachable from the ground ) .  in the slightly contrived opening scenes , we witness his heroism in action , as he , and his mentor ( played by scott glenn ) attempt to rescue a small girl and her dog from an oncoming forest fire .  william forsythe plays the bad guy , a mass murderer who has several million dollars tucked away to help fund his jailbreak .  he ( and five convict cohorts ) manages to get selected for firefighting duty when a woodland blaze just happens to ignite nearby .  his escape plan bets a lot on the laxity of the guards , but ( since there must be a movie ) luck is with him .  soon the now-escaped convicts are masquerading as canadian firefighters .  why canadian ?  who knows , eh ?  along the way they pick up a pretty birdwatcher ( suzy amis ) to be their hostage .  enter howie long .  he's called in to help fight the blaze , and when he spots the group of "" ground pounders "" , apparently lost , he parachutes in to help .  when he discovers their true identity , he is the only thing standing between them and escape , and the only hope of help for the hostage .  long's acting talents are above those of , say , steven seagal , but not by much .  although his delivery is mostly flat and wooden , he's a likeable hero , and there are some hints here and there that he may get better .  the script doesn't help him out any , however .  all too often , it veers into the realm of the unintentionally funny .  the dialogue is strictly b-movie material , and the plotting relies too heavily on coincidences to be believable .  long's co-stars are a mixed bag .  at least they're all comfortable in their respective roles .  forsythe has the scenery-chewing villain down cold , down cold , and scott glenn is always enjoyable to watch , even when he doesn't seem to be stretching his talents ( as is definitely the case here ) .  suzy amis plays peril pretty well , but isn't given much more to do .  some of the nature and wildfire shots are interesting , but many are rather bland .  you'd think that the director , dean semler , a former cinematographer , would at least produce a film with interesting visuals .  that's not the case .  there's a lack of originality to nearly all the sequences . . . we've  seen this stuff before .  it's not the most auspicious start to 1998 , but it could have been worse ( just think back to 1996's debut , bio-dome ) .  however , after a month of oscar-caliber pictures , a movie like firestorm at least gives you some perspective on how good those movies really were .  in fact , there's a good chance that some of them are still playing near you . . .

""  or how about when diedre takes out her therapist in another ridiculous scene ?   ( diedre's therapist wishes to have her recommitted , so she decides to visit diedre , alone , in her new apartment -- never realizing , of course , that it's not her's .  therapists typically are catatonically brain-dead in these movies ) .  having successfully snuffed the woman out , diedre looks at the body and says : "" what was it that you always said to me at the end of each session , dr . jones ?  oh , that's right .  'i'm sorry , but your time is up ! ' ""  this is what passes for humor in the film .  the audience doesn't necessarily laugh but groan ( the type of groan that suggests the audience can't believe they're watching this crap -- although watching it they are ) .  nick mancuso's chainsmoking , nervous-wreck character does not have the cheesy lines that butler's character delivers , but his ridiculously overdone performance provides for some better comic relief .  in between drags off his cigarette , for instance , in one of the movie's best scenes , david tries to explain to his lawyer what a creep his ex-wife is .  in exaggerated exasperation , he nearly shouts "" the woman is a cuckoo-bird ! ""   ( trust me , it is funny in context . )  and so , the movie continues until its painfully obvious conclusion .  i won't reveal the ending specifically ( though anyone remotely familiar with thrillers of this type could probably guess the ending just from this film review ) , but i will say that the ex has one of the biggest fire hazards appearing recently in film .  molly and david own a cabin that becomes engulfed by flames in approximately three seconds !  molly , at one point in the film , not-so-brilliantly observes , after discovering diedre has moved into an apartment across from her family's to spy upon them , that "" she's crazy . ""  you'd be pretty crazy too if you'd rented this turkey .  i'd avoid it unless it's on tv and you come across it .  if you do , you may want to watch it , groan at the bad punchlines and stupid plot , and feel good that you didn't spend money renting it .

0|the blues brothers was a wonderful film , a hilarious comedy packed with good music .  it cried out for a sequel , but john belushi's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea .  however , eighteen years have passed , and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged .  unfortunately , it's a sequel not worthy of the original .  the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended .  elwood blues ( dan aykroyd ) is just getting out of jail , his brother jake having recently died .  as in the first film , he first visits mother mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) and then sets about getting the band back together .  john belushi's absence leaves a terrible hole in the film , and although three new characters are created to fill the void , it is still very noticeable .  first , there's cabel ( joe morton ) the illegitimate son of elwood's stepfather ( played by cab calloway in the first movie ) .  cabel is reluctant to join his destiny , and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff , chasing the blues brothers band .  next , there's mighty mack ( john goodman ) , a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band .  finally , there's buster ( j .  evan bonifant ) , a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band .  the plotting of the film is hardly original . . . it  seems to be almost a clone of the original .  elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band , they then travel , while being pursued by the police , and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale .  the first film had neo-nazis as the random element , this time around , the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role .  in fact , the duplication of the plot is so ridiculously complete that certain scenes are practically identical to the original .  remember the classic performance at country bob's ( where they like both types of music : country and western ) from the first movie ?  well , this movie has a performance at a country fair , where the band is expected to play bluegrass music .  there's the massive police car pileup , although this time the gag falls completely flat .  there's even an exact replica of the conversion scene in the church of reverend cleophus ( james brown ) .  there are plenty of recurring characters too .  in addition to mother stigmata and reverend cleophus , aretha franklin reprises her role as mrs . murphy .  frank oz , a prison guard in the first film , makes an appearance here as the prison warden .  as the stars , the new blues brothers don't live up to their legacy .  aykroyd is more loquacious , yet much flatter as elwood .  john goodman barely has a character as mighty mack .  joe morton has the deepest character , but not a terribly interesting one , as cab .  and what's the deal with the orphan ?  it plays like a desperate gimmick that doesn't mesh at all with the rest of the film .  at least bonifant isn't as precocious as he could have been in the role .  but the true star , and the only saving grace , of the film is the music .  and the film is packed with it ( even during and after the ending credits ) .  although there are no brilliant mergers of comedy and song as in the original's rawhide/stand by your man medley , the music is very much enjoyable .  to top it off , the film is packed to the gills with cameo musician appearances .  b . b . king , blues traveler , eric clapton , travis tritt , wilson pickett , erykah badu , bo diddley and steve winwood are just a sampling of the multitude of stars that make an appearance here and there .  unfortunately , the music pauses here and there to allow in the familiar plot .  if simply copying the original blues brothers wasn't bad enough , writers aykroyd and john landis dumb it down , removing any memorable characters , and replacing them with flashy , but unbelievable , magical gimmicks .  it's a shame .  buy the soundtrack and avoid the film .  better yet , rewatch the original . . . you'll  have a much better time .  |-0.23333333333333336|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|The sentiment of the explanations is mixed, leaning slightly towards negative, as they highlight disappointment with the sequel, specifically pointing out flaws in the plot and absence of key characters, although they also mention positive aspects such as the music and comedy.
0|michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels , many of which are science fiction .  the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel .  so in the logic of the film industry a good way to make a profitable film would be to make a big-budget adaptation of another crichton science fiction novel .  congo failed , and i am afraid that sphere is probably not going to fare a whole lot better .  it a little better than just okay novel and it makes a film that is not even that good .  the film is expensive , over one hundred million dollars ; is long , 133 minutes ; has a terrific cast , including dustin hoffman , samuel l . jackson , and sharon stone ; but has little that is really original and less that is exciting .  several years ago dr . norman goodman ( played by dustin hoffman ) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered .  the plan he wrote was only semi-serious , but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien .  now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes ( peter coyote ) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s .  suddenly norman's less than serious procedure has become an action plan for dealing with a real alien spacecraft .  included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams ( samuel l . jackson ) , biologist beth halperin ( sharon stone ) , and astrophysicist ted fielding ( liev schreiber ) .  together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets .  one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold-toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship .  what is disappointing about this film is that it does not have really effective performances .  director barry levinson is at his best with good actors rather than good special effects .  the problem here is he is making a big-budget science fiction film .  it has some effects , but the most intriguing effect he shows only as an outline on a radar screen .  the technique is to suggest rather than to show and let the actors and the viewer's imagination carry the film as robert wise did with the haunting .  that could be a reasonable approach in a low-budget film .  but that requires creating much more atmosphere than levinson can manage to muster .  it requires the actors to give really compelling performances and simply put , they don't .  hoffman's acting seems muted .  jackson seems to laid back .  we do not feel for these characters and do not get inside their heads .  levinson paid big bucks for his actors and does not really get price performance .  and why we have queen latifah as a minor functionary on the expedition is anybody's guess . a  cast of unknowns could have delivered as much emotional impact at a fraction of the price .  look how much more powerful a film like alien was with only moderate actors .  most science fiction spectaculars these days have second-tier actors and first-tier special effects .  levinson tries second-tier effects , and first-tier actors , but never makes that exchange pay off for the viewer .  perhaps sci-fi spectaculars are just not an actor's medium .  the result gets a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and 0 on the -4 to +4 scale .  |-0.6|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|The sentiment of the explanations is consistently negative, with criticism focused on the lack of effective performances and the films' failure to live up to expectations.

0|"american pie 2 is filled with laughs .  but they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater .  i'm no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy .  but the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment , not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself .  what separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart .  of the original , i noted it was "" a warm , pleasant outing about the travails of growing up .

0|well , what are you going to expect ?  it's a movie about a big snake that eats people .  that's what i should have been thinking when i viewed this film , because maybe then i would have enjoyed myself more .  instead , i ended up wishing a giant snake would come along and eat me , too .  anaconda is about a documentary film crew sailing down a south american river .  led by anthropologists dr . steven cale ( eric stolz ) and terri flores ( jennifer lopez ) , the crew is attempting to locate a lost tribe of natives .  along the way , they find poacher paul sarone ( jon voight ) , and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda .  to simply say that this is the world's largest snake wouldn't be doing it justice , since the anaconda in this movie is at least two feet wide .  if this isn't a good reason to avoid picking up hitchhikers , i don't know what is .  at the beginning of anaconda , we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past , but that seems to be more or less over now .  i expected that fact to play a key part somewhere down the line , but it ended up being a set-up for nothing .  cale chokes on a deadly wasp ( don't ask me how that happens - i don't know ) and is put out of action , relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help .  this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot , since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone's plan to capture the snake .  however , this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film , and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle .  most bad characters are either annoying or stupid .  in this movie , they're both .  since this description applies to all the characters except sarone , it's hard to find someone to root for .  you're supposed to back the good guys , but you really end up cheering for sarone because he's smarter than everyone else .  or maybe he's just not as dumb as everyone else .  at times , i almost found myself rooting for the snake .  there are no standout performances here .  everyone seems to be reciting lines written for stock characters .  even voight appears to be doing his best impression of christopher walken for some reason .  no matter , as in most monster movies , the snake is supposed to be the real star anyway .  in most of the scenes , the snake is computer generated , and the effects crew did a decent job of making it look real .  however , the realism is thrown off by some pretty unrealistic occurrences .  sometimes , for example , the snake just moves too fast .  it catches a guy jumping off of a waterfall , for crying out loud .  then there's another scene where the snake eats one of the characters , and we see the snake's skin drawn so tightly over its prey that we can see the victim's pained expression from within the snake's belly .  absolutely ridiculous .  a testimony to the film's bad direction is the inclusion of a scene early on the in the film , where we get to see just how dangerous the mighty anaconda is .  in a scene totally unrelated to anything else , we are witness to the big snake winning a showdown with a panther .  the anaconda wraps itself around the powerful feline as if it were a stuffed animal and squeezes it so hard , one of the panther's eyeballs pops out .  eeeewwwww .  above and beyond the sick factor , however , this scene surprised me because it actually showed the face of the snake before a quarter of the movie had even passed .  in films like these , a sense of mystery surrounding the monster must be maintained .  if the characters are reacting to something they fear more than see , we as an audience must experience that feeling along with them .  to show us the monster early on is to let us in on something the characters don't know about , and therefore allow us to get used to the danger before the pivotal moment when man and beast have their climactic showdown .  in a case like that , the showdown just ends up being a letdown .  when i saw the snake for the first time , i decided to give the film the benefit of the doubt and assume that the snake i saw wasn't the real danger .  this one was just a decoy , and there was actually a bigger snake waiting to make its appearance just when everyone thought they were safe .  no such luck .  okay , maybe anaconda is actually a decoy , and there's really a better movie waiting to make its debut .  |-0.6|0.8333333333333334|0.9|The overall sentiment of the text is negative, as the user expresses disappointment with the movie, criticizes various aspects such as weak plot and lack of character development, and mentions wanting to be eaten by a giant snake instead.

""  one of the oddest structural points of the film is the handling of eric stoltz .  early in the story , his character gets knocked into a coma by a river insect and spends virtually the rest of the movie unconscious .  so why did they hire an actor of the caliber of stoltz for what amounts to a cameo appearance ?  also , why did stoltz , who generally selects his roles with great care , agree to appear in this crap ?  ah , the mysteries of hollywood .  the remaining crew members are basically just snake food waiting to happen .  jonathan hyde is mildly diverting as a pompous englishman hired to narrate the documentary , but lopez and ice cube manage to rise above their cardboard characters .  lopez , who starred in "" selena , "" is an enormously appealing performer , possessing a vibrancy that makes even the most trite lines seem credible .  ice cube has a special charisma ; an ability to look like a macho adult and a frightened boy simultaneously .  there's also a special twinkle in his eyes , as if he's gently mocking his own tough-guy posturing .  but the movie really centers around the outrageously hammy performance of jon voight .  obsessed with capturing one of the giant anacondas , voight plays the villain in thick accent , with a series of leers and hisses , spouting the kind of dialogue usually heard only in episodes of "" jonny quest . ""  at one point , he looms over the crew and says "" the anaconda is the perfect killing machine .  it strikes , wraps around you , holds you tighter than your true love .  and you get the privilege of hearing your bones break before the power of its embrace causes your veins to explode .

0|"14 years ago , national lampoon introduced us to a new family - the griswolds .  in 1983 , the griswolds embarked on a cross-country journey with the destination of wally world , a world-renowned theme park in california .  we laughed our heads off as we shared the wild and crazy mishaps the family endured .  two years later , we watched again as they went to europe , and four years after that , we shared christmas with them .  now , eight more years have passed , and the laughs have done more than die .  they've been cremated .  vegas vacation brings back chevy chase as clark griswold , the good intentioned but ill-fated father of two .  the premise is basically the same .  clark has a wonderful idea to take his family on a bonding vacation , this time to las vegas .  his wife ellen ( beverly d'angelo ) and teenage kids rusty and audrey ( always played by different actors - this time around , by ethan embry and marisol nichols , respectively ) join him and they soon find themselves in sin city where casinos will make the backdrop for ninety minutes of slapstick .  of course a "" vacation "" movie wouldn't be complete without good ole eddie ( reprised by randy quaid ) , the misfit cousin , showing up at all the wrong times .  there isn't too much of a plot here when it comes right down to it .  it's really just a skit movie .  there are a couple of ways to define a skit movie , which is not a real term as far as i know .  the first would be a movie that basically has one running gag for two hours , therefore coming off like a two hour skit .  the second would be a movie that seems comprised of about twenty shorter skits , each lasting about five minutes .  vegas vacation comes off like the first .  a good example of the latter would be last year's black sheep .  the problem with this format is that it becomes old fast , and it doesn't really fit into a movie mold .  in these cases , a "" plot "" , which is generally very thin , is used either as a shameless filler between scenes or to simply add convenience to the gags ( i . e .  have a good vegas joke , make a vegas movie ) .  such is the case with this movie's mini-plots .  clark gets gambling fever and begins spending all of the griswold's money , ellen is on the verge of an affair with wayne newton ( ! ) , rusty has a fake id and is using it to his gambling advantage , and audrey is desperate for fun and winds up joining her cousin vickie ( shae d'lyn ) as an exotic dancer .  the simple fact is : this movie isn't funny .  at first , i did find myself chuckling heartily at a couple of little jokes , but when the movie got rolling , my interest suddenly stopped .  chase plays clark griswold really well .  he made the character and he is the character .  d'angelo , to be quite honest , never was too impressive as ellen , and this movie doesn't show any signs of redemption .  as for the two new griswold kids , the word "" blah "" comes to mind .  the "" vacation "" series seems out to prove that anybody can play these two characters , the simple reason being that there is nothing to them .  they're so generic , you'll expect the credits to read "" girl #1 as audrey griswold "" .  vegas vacation differs from the first three in the series by more than just laugh factor .  yes , it's true that vegas vacation isn't even close to being close to being as funny as the others , which were actually pretty fun in their own doofy ways , but there are a couple of other things that set this one negatively apart .  first off , why did they leave off the national lampoon's heading on the title ?  i couldn't find any reasons why , but maybe the fact is even national lampoon didn't want to be associated with such a lame film .  that's saying a lot , especially when you look at what else the company has proudly presented : loaded weapon 1 , pcu , etc . if they expected this to be another hit , you would assume they'd be proud to tack on the notorious header , but for reasons only we can guess at , like the movie sucking , they didn't .  there is another difference here that makes an obvious impact .  the first three films in the "" vacation "" series were written by john hughes , a talented writer who is behind several popular films of the 80's including mr .  mom , sixteen candles , the breakfast club , weird science , pretty in pink , ferris bueller's day off , planes , trains , and automobiles , and uncle buck .  wowzers !  what a r ? sum ? !  looking at the names , you'd think this guy wrote everything that now stands as a movie icon for the 1980's .  well that's not all .  this guy also brought us 90's hits including the home alone series , the remake of 101 dalmatians , dennis the menace , and the current flubber .  vegas vacation , however , didn't have john hughes behind it , and the loss is very obvious .  this time around , the script is in the hands of elisa bell , whose only credits thus far include four made-for-tv movies .  vegas vacation plays very much like one , and it would actually work much better as a made-for-tv sequel .  if this sounds like a wild idea , it's not .  revenge of the nerds third and fourth installments were both television movies , and they seemed like it .  vegas vacation would fit in well on the fox network as a 2 : 00 a . m .  sunday morning movie , but as a silver screen major motion picture , it's quite out of place .  stephen kessler's jejune direction doesn't help things either .  he only makes the film even more tv-movie-ish .  each consecutive "" vacation "" movie has suffered a drop in directing power .  we started the series off with harold ramis , who also directed caddyshack and groundhog day as well as co-writing ghostbusters .  not too bad .  then we had national lampoon's european vacation being directed by amy heckerling , who would go on to direct the hits look who's talking and clueless , as well as having already directed the infamous fast times at ridgemont high .  lastly we had national lampoon's christmas vacation , directed by jeremiah s . chechik , who went on to direct the charming benny & joon .  kessler , so far , has one title under his belt , the short film birch street gym , which received an oscar nomination in 1992 .  granted that this was his first attempt at a feature length film , we can allow for some amateurish quality , but instead we get a movie straight from the text book - boring , bland , and deeply unoriginal .  if you loved the "" vacation "" movies , and i know * some * of us did , there still isn't anything here worth seeing .  if you loved them , don't ruin your good impressions of the series by indulging in this tragic example of cinema ala carte .  if you never did like the series , why the need to confirm why ?

0|plunkett & macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott , brother of ridley and tony .  naturally , this got me worried .  would jake's talent be inherited from ridley or tony ?  if it was from ridley , than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in .  if it was from tony , it would be wham bang drivel .  unfortunately , the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm .  carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen , plunkett ( carlyle ) who is poor and unruly , and captain james macleane ( miller ) a clean cut gentleman .  as the tagline clearly wants to make known , they rob the rich and nothing else .  the film basically follows the rowdy hold ups the two stage , along with romantic interludes with lady rebecca ( tyler . )  hot on both their tails is mr chance ( ken stott ) who wants to see them both dead .  plunkett & macleane is an annoying little film that serves little purpose .  although undoubtedly slick and fast paced , there's very little merit contained in the film .  carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair , although their characters are criminally undeveloped .  it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes , but not on the script .  the five ( ! ) screenwriters ( three credited ) have produced an still born movie : there's very little development in the story .  also , major events , such as mr . cash finding out who plunkett and macleane really are , are so rushed that they barely happened .  the story is a bit of a mess , frankly .  the performances aren't bad : carlyle and miller are typical lads , but liv tyler is a huge disappointment as the love interest .  her irritable , stilted performance sticks out like a sore thumb , and i was quite unsure on what accent she was trying to put on .  she looks nice , though .  more interesting is alan cummings as the campy lord rochester , and although his character amounts to nothing more than a two dimensional comedy gay character , he hams it up well .  ken stott is suitably evil as chance , but again he is nothing but a flat character .  i didn't particularly care when the predictable death sequence arrived .  although a disappointment in writing , and a minor success in acting , the film certainly look lavish , with good costumes , and wonderful sets .  but production design alone can't save a movie , especially a movie as bad as this mess .  jake scott would be more suited to directing a music video rather than this failed update of a period drama : the only update seems to be the fact that everyone must talk dirty , with 'f * ck this' and 'stand and f * cking deliver' splattered all over the place .  the mtv editing and direction are flash enough , but in the end decidedly empty .  plunkett & macleane is a massive disappointment .  although somewhat enjoyable during parts , it's so light it could float off the screen if it wasn't just images on a reel .  there's no thought , no development , no plot , just a series of manic edits and quirky camera angles to make this film appeal to gen-xers .  although it's a great idea : update a period drama to the mtv generation : it's execution is awful , and would more likely bore than excite .  sloppy and occasionally off puttingly tasteless , it's hard to recommend plunkett & macleane as a movie , but easy to recommend it as a overlong music video .  give it a miss .  |-0.75|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|"The overall sentiment towards ""Plunkett & Macleane"" is extremely negative, as the reviews consistently criticize the writing, directing, performances, undeveloped characters, and messy story of the film, with only a few redeeming qualities."
0|"capsule : silly and inane adaptation of gibson's short story , which is nowhere in sight .  gibson's script only adds insult to injury .  johnny mnemonic is an awesomely bad movie .  i say "" awesomely "" because it's one thing to fail , but another thing entirely to fail so completely that even the chances for camp value are sabotaged .  keanur reeves ( who is terrible ) stars as johnny , an "" information courier "" who can carry dozens of gigabytes of data in his head .  he is given "" one last job "" ( whenever you are in a movie and you hear those words , run ) , which involves him shoving so much data into his cranium that it could be lethal .  one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories , but it's only followed up on in a token fashion .  for his trouble , johnny gets chased by the yakuza , who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high-tech thrillers .  what's funny is that if you watch gangster movies made * in * japan , there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics , but of course there's no room in this movie for any of that .  the yakuza are simply used to point guns , wave swords , flaunt tattoos , and grimace menacingly .   ( i could go on about how gangsters and criminals of many other ethnicities have gotten thoughtful examinations in the movies -- bound by honor , sugar hill and american me come to mind -- when asians remain perpetually stereotyped .  but that's another essay . )  anyway , johnny runs and eventually winds up in newark .  why newark ?  maybe because it was cheaper to fake a future newark than a future new york , that's why .  there , he meets an assortment of odd characters ( ice-t , dolph lundgren and henry rollins play a whole gallery of weirdos ) .  the script deals with them with all the depth of pieces of furniture .  it turns out ( what else ? ) that the data in johnny's head could save a lot of people , but of course johnny only wants it out of his head so it doesn't kill him .  handled right , this could have been absorbing , but the script manages to mangle any chance of real sympathy for johnny at every opportunity .  the details about the look and feel of the future are all phoned in from other , better movies -- blade runner and brazil come to mind .  everything looks run-down and scummy , everyone dresses like they're punk rockers , and videophones are commonplace .  snore .  the only really interesting flourish is an extended depiction of the way the internet might work in the future ( complete with vr goggles and feedback gloves ) , but i kept thinking that it was more like what some relatively un-technical fellow would * think * it would look and behave like .  a hacker of johnny's caliber would be blasting away with one command-line function after another , instead of wasting all this time twiddling with holograms , but of course that's not cinematic .  whatever .  what went wrong with this movie ?  gibson wrote his own screenplay , which i guess is part of the problem : what works as a short story doesn't work in a movie .  his ear for dialogue is terrible and the plot doesn't advance , it convulses .  from the script on out , it was probably all downhill .  renting the movie to make fun of it is sort of pointless ; there's no fun in kicking a wounded dog , is there ?

0|i didn't hate the big hit , even though it is a stupefyingly terrible film .  for the entirety of its running time , my eyes were attached to the screen , and i never once got bored .  i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness : this is such a confused disaster of a film that it's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl .  as a narrative , the big hit is pure garbage , never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries .  it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank , which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways .  it's fine to mix genres , if the film makers know what they're doing .  unfortunately , writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong don't seem to know how to handle the material , and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy .  the biggest problem with the amalgamation , in this case , is that the film is absurd and the comedy is out of place .  but it sure is a fascinating failure .  marky .   .   .  er , mark wahlberg stars as melvin surley , a hitman .  he's a good hitman , apparently , although his tactics seem a bit rambunctious ( he doesn't snipe or make clean kills--he just kicks the door down and shoots everything ) .  he works with a few other hitmen--cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) , crunch ( bokeem woodbine ) , and vinnie ( antonio sabbato , jr . ) .  they're a nice bunch of muscular guys , who stand around in the locker room after working out and compare masturbation to sex .  they all work for a man named paris ( avery brooks ) , who is rich , powerful , and in constant need of four sloppy hitmen .  it is very important that they never go beyond their boss and do work on their own ; this , of course , is where the plot comes in .  they decide to kidnap a young japanese girl named keiko ( china chow ) , who has a rich father .  when they do this , it turns out she is paris' .   .   .  goddaughter !  it's very bad to have paris against you .  the story is standard action film stuff .  it's nothing new , and nothing particularly offensive ( but certainly not the slightest bit compelling ) .  clearly the major selling point of the big hit is that it's a john woo-type of action film mixed in with some really hip comedy .  it's true that a lot of the action sequences resemble recent films that go for the same idea ( such as face/off and the replacement killers , which are both far superior ) .  there are stunts that are fun to watch : the opening sequence has melvin and two of his partners going in to kill some guy who has nothing to do with the story .  they use night vision goggles and really powerful handguns .  melvin is also very good at breakdancing , and uses this talent to avoid bullets and knives .  like i said , it's not boring ; most disasters aren't .  what makes it so bad is its genre-shifting madness .  it seems to start out as a quirky-but-realistic action comedy , as melvin is seen transporting bags of human remains .  then , as soon as they go to their first hit , it turns into a music video with bodies and bullets flying everywhere .  then , somewhere in between , it turns back into comedy .  keiko turns out to be a spunky little girl ; in one amusing scene , she is forced to read a letter out loud , indicating that she has been kidnapped , but the letter is littered with grammatical errors that skew the meaning of the words .  and scenes like this work alone , but wong applies this goofy tone to scenes that should be more serious , or not be in the film at all .  one of the most irritating moments has paris ordering cisco to come up to his office after he learns that keiko has been kidnapped ; when cisco gets there , paris and his men are standing around as if they knew cisco did it , but they let him out of there , telling him to find the perpetrator .  the scene is played for laughs , but it isn't funny .  and since it doesn't quite work as a comedy , it tries to fall back on the action , which also fails .  this is a film where people fly fifteen feet backwards when shot with a handgun .  cars land on tree branches and are supported by them .  characters betray each other without a second thought .  grenades are thrown in tight places .  people jump out of tall buildings and survive .  people outrun tumbling cars , and get out of the way of falling objects in small fractions of seconds .  most frustrating of all , though , is the film's definition of a hit man : these guys are anything but subtle , quiet , and skilled individuals .  they're more like socially depraved militia men ( melvin has an extensive collection of firearms in his garage , including missile launchers and hand-held machineguns ) .  the characters each have one trait that distinguishes them from the rest ; this obviously doesn't make for deep or interesting people to watch .  the acting is kind of fun , though--wahlberg is a good actor , and his innocuous presence in this film is charming in a silly sort of way .  phillips certainly has fun with his psychotic character , while christina applegate , who plays melvin's fianc ? e , is convincingly air-headed .  the big hit is an action film that unknowingly spoofs itself in trying to be funny .  the funniest parts are supplied by the actors , and not by the numerous failed attempts at sight gags and one-liners .  it's a true disaster , one that makes me believe that the goofy and unrealistic tone is completely unintentional .  despite all this , though , i must reiterate the entertainment value here .  you can cherish the awfulness of a film like this .  if you embrace the big hit for the catastrophe that it is , you just might enjoy yourself .  |-0.29400000000000004|0.8483333333333333|0.7000000000000001|"The majority sentiment of the explanations is heavily negative, with criticism directed towards the film's confused narrative, genre-shifting, unrealistic action sequences, failed attempts at humor, and unrealistic tone.

0|when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain , you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie .  however , since this film also featured michael madsen , more than capable character actor , this time in the role of protagonist , the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt .  however , the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana , tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio ( played by lynch ) .  however , the raid was only partially successful , and montana is getting the rap .  so , he begins his own private war against gio , trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt .  in the process , he meets gio's mistress gina zamora ( played by rosie vela ) and starts relationship with her too .  although it doesn't stink like many of the similar films can , inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine .  nobody in this film actually puts much effort , including madsen or lynch , and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke .  the only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela , who , apart from showing her more than impressive looks , shows some of the singing talent too .  however , this isn't reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would , in most likelihood , forget the next day .  |-0.6666666666666666|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|The film is described as a forgettable B-grade action movie with uninspired performances and writing, with the only somewhat positive element being Rosie Vela's presence and singing talent.

0|"you don't look at a ren ? magritte painting and search for a deeper meaning .  you likewise don't look at one for 88 minutes straight .  surrealist works are notable for their quirks , and they are fun , but looking at one quirk for an hour and a half is exhausting .  that was my experience with i woke up early the day i died , a surrealistic , hyperactive comedy with no dialogue .  it's not a silent movie ; there is lots of atmospheric music , occasional screams and weird sound effects , but nobody ever utters an audible word .  though the film is distinctive , its unique style wore thin after about 20 minutes , and as it progressed , watching became a chore .  the only reason the script ever got filmed is because it was written by the pseudo-legendary ed wood , the man behind such "" classics "" as plan 9 >from outer space and night of the ghouls .  the joke , of course , is that his films are so bad , they're good ; so humorous in their inanity that they become hits .  i woke up early the day i died , unfortunatly , is so bad that it's really bad .  it stars billy zane ( titanic ) as a dangerous lunatic who overpowers a nurse , escapes from a mental hospital and proceeds to wonder around , stealing a car , clothes , and a load of money .  our thief reaches a cemetery , where he witnesses a bizarre ritual .  he falls asleep and finds himself , literally , in a hole , with his money gone .  for whatever reason , he is bent on getting his hard-unearned cash back ( considering how easily he stole it the first time , why didn't he just go steal some more ? ) .  he comes upon a list of the people who were at the mysterious ceremony and commences to seek out each of them and kill them if they don't have what he is looking for .  i don't think either director aris iliopulos nor ed wood realized that this would have made a glorious 20 minute short .  the subject and the style seem to have been made for it .  unfortunately , twenty minutes worth of material is stretched out to more than four times that length , and the film simply overstays its already dubious welcome .  it grabbed my attention in the beginning and gradually lost it as it went on , up to the point where halfway through i was already weary .  it might seem odd that a film as furiously paced as this one can be so tedious ; but the surprise will wear off when you consider how repetitive it is .  i woke up early the day i died is a comedy , i guess , though it could have fooled me .  unlike most ed wood films , this one tries to be funny and fails , instead of the other way around .  there's nothing inherently wrong with that , in fact , i think it would only make sense for someone who has been so "" good "" at making unintentional comedies to take a stab at a real one .  whether wood actually went for comedy in his script we'll never know , but in either case , this is a failure .  jonathan taylor thomas , christina ricci , summer phoenix , john ritter and others show up for short and pointless cameos .  ricci , for example , plays a prostitute .  her role consists of dancing around with zane in his motel room and then being thrown out .  thomas is an astonished onlooker as a woman gets thrown off a cliff .  was the home improvement teen heartthrob really that desperate for work ?  zane , meanwhile , occupies himself by making weird faces at the camera when he is not called upon to run around wildly and beat people up .  lack of dialogue makes him the ultimate caricature .  the carnival side-show climax manages to demonstrate everything that is wrong with this no-budget production .  it's desperately unfunny , but thinks it's the funniest thing since plan 9 ; , it's so spontaneously surrealistic it makes your head spin all while being confusing enough to make your head spin twice as fast in the other direction .  i hope another film is made from an ed wood screenplay for i woke up early the day i died is not a fitting send-off .   ? 1999 eugene novikov &#137 ;  "|-0.4666666666666666|0.7833333333333333|0.8833333333333333|"The explanations highlight a negative sentiment towards the film ""I Woke Up Early The Day I Died"", with criticism towards its exhausting and tedious nature, lack of humor and dialogue, repetitive plot, questionable casting choices, and poor production value, resulting in an overall negative sentiment but not extremely strong."
0|well , as i check my score card for what i've done this holiday weekend , it reads good ideas : 0 and dumb ideas : 1 .  i don't know what i was thinking when i decided to watch this movie .  but in my defense , i can only say that it was someone else who urged me to see this with him .  the film that i'm talking about is `a night at the roxbury , ' one of those offerings based on a saturday night live skit .  wayne and garth , these two are not .  rather , we meet doug and steve butabi ( the actors' names are not worth mentioning ) , two eternal partyers whose greatest ambitions in life seem to be finding a way to get into the hottest night club in the city , the roxbury .  driving in their dad's bmw and donning metallic disco suits right out of miami vice , they try to bribe the bouncer to get into the club .  `have you met my friend washington and his friend roosevelt , ' they confidently say as they pull out spare pocket change .  their second greatest ambition seems to be oozing out as many silly pick-up lines as is humanly possible in order to start a conversation with a girl ( `let me see that label .  just as i thought - made in heaven , ' says one of the brothers ) .  and , like the losers that they are , they fail to do either for much of the film .  however , as fate would have it , an accidental meeting with `what-ever-happened-to' richard grieco gives them the all-important ticket to get in .  their sad lives take on a whole new direction .  they make an important contact with the club owner who believes that these two brothers have uncanny insight into the club scene .  and they are mistaken as rich swingers by two voluptuous young women .  but their newfound popularity does not impress their father , who has other plans for them .  the unfortunate thing about this film is that this is a one-joke movie , and the brothers are the joke .  actually , there's about 10 mintues worth of tolerable stuff .  alas , too long for tv and way too short for a feature-length film .  thus , there just isn't enough material to sustain the 83-minute movie .  there's no plot to be found and everything that these two do seem to culminate in an opportunity to execute their trademark move of snapping their heads in unison to the funky beat of haddaway's europop song , what is love .  i was amazed that none of the two suffered from whiplash .  to take up more film time , there is a subplot involving the daughter of the businessman next door who wants to marry doug .  this creates not only friction between the brothers , but their unlikely pairing will also agitate audience members as well .  she's educated and a forebearing witch .  meanwhile , doug is a complete loser .  how did these two ever get together ?  i suppose that if i can ever figure out the answer to that question , i'll have figured out why i decided to go and see this movie .  if you're looking for entertainment , you won't find it at the roxbury .  |-0.7666666666666666|0.9|0.8333333333333334|The user's sentiment is negative as they express disappointment and frustration with the movie, criticizing its lack of plot, characters, and material to sustain its length, while also mentioning an agitating subplot involving the daughter of a businessman next door.
0|terrence malick made an excellent 90 minute film adaptation of james jones' world war ii novel .  unfortunately , he buried it within an overlong and overreaching 3-hour long pseudo-epic .  this is a shame because the film features an outstanding performance by nick nolte .  the best scene is when nick nolte's character , lt . col . tall , is forced to deal with the direct refusal by capt . staros ( elias koteas ) to execute an order .  nolte's reaction and transformation may be the best work of his career .  had terrence malick concentrated on the great performances of nolte and koteas as well as those by sean penn , woody harrelson , and john cusack , he could have made a truly great film .  instead , malick saddled the film with plodding pacing , unnecessary flashbacks , and a voice-over narration all designed to telegraph the great philosophical underpinnings of the story .  the narration was especially annoying as much of it sounded like very bad high school poetry .  with a lot of editing , the core story could be transformed into a truly classic war film .  hopefully , the dvd version of this film will feature options to suppress the narration , and perhaps will even provide for an alternate , shorter version of the film .  i give this film .  |-0.5|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|The reviewers have a negative sentiment towards the film, criticizing it for being overlong, overreaching, burdened with unnecessary elements like voice-over narration, and having bad high school poetry.

0|"i cried during _babe_ .  i admit it .  the special effects , the story , the great dialogue were woven together so delicately and successfully that my mind lost track that this was a "" children's film "" --so much so that , yes , i got a little overly sentimental .  such , my friend , is the power of cinema .  when word came out that they were using this newly developed f/x for a doctor dolittle update , in which eddie murphy plays the title character , and many great comic actors supply the voices , my anticipation rose to great expectations .  they can't possibly drop the ball on this one .  can't miss .  can't possibly miss .  they missed .  what went wrong ?  after much thought , i supply three general rules .   ( 1 ) don't let a television actress-turned-comedy movie director near an urbanite script ( i . e . , penny marshall's dreadful "" preacher's wife "" ) .  betty thomas worked wonders with "" the brady bunch movie "" , but the same sitcom-airiness doesn't quite work here .  it's as if she lifted a generic sitcom , and iced it with light doses of modern r&b .  take away the black cast , take away the atrocious soundtrack , and you have the residue of some mid-80's kirk cameron show .   ( 2 ) the greater the cast , the less the individual cast-member has to do ( i . e . ,   "" con air "" ) .  it is great to have the comic voices of jenna elfman , garry schandling , john leguizimo , ellen degeneres , and gilbert godfried in your lineup , but they have nothing to do but improvise their underdeveloped , stereotyped characters , one-line-at-a-time .  it's even worse , because sometimes their voices are so unrecognizable that you don't get the satisfaction of linking the voice to the comedian until the credits .  now there are three character actors who do get special treatment : albert brooks brings dignity to nearly every project he's in , and the scenes as a depressed tiger do resonate a certain poignancy .  norm mcdonald fares nearly as well , as a stray dog who learns to bond with dolittle .  but there's little humor here .  that rests on the shoulders of chris rock , sorely miscast and unfunny as the voice of their wise-ass guinea pig .  even the mouth is ill-synched .   ( 3 ) don't let the special effects technicians walk away with the script .  there's a certain timing that's mandatory in comedy .  to have this timing usurped by the brilliancy of computer generated mouths or lifelike creations of jim henson's creature shop , is a travesty .  this is not to say that special effects filled comedies or muppet movies aren't well-timed laughfests ; with the right director , they can be and have .  here , betty thomas is clearly over her head .  i wish i could commend the special effects , but they're merely average .  count the number of times where the animal's mouth is turned away from the camera , or too far to notice , or ill-synched .  this is less a "" babe "" and more of a "" look who's barking "" clone .  you may be wondering , 'how does eddie murphy fare ? '  well , he came back with the exceptional "" nutty professor "" , and i don't doubt he can come back again .  here , he's tied into a straight man and given little to do .  the exceptions are when he fears he's going crazy : a far cry from his smarter-than-you'd expect routine that he's more adept at .  it's unfortunate that he is where richard pryor was ten years ago , making lame comedies without the same bite he had given in his early years .  after all this , what's left ?  butt jokes .  a _lot_ of butt jokes .  i guess for kids that may be funny , but i was stone-faced .  if there's a lesson the film may be telling us , is that animals have feelings too , and they care way too much for your butt .

0|"saw an advanced screening of the movie sniper last night , and i have to say i wasn't too impressed .  this film is about an expert marine sniper , played by tom berenger , who is teamed with a hot-shot-young-no-experience-never-killed-a-man new partner to take out some drug-kingpins and military strong men in panama .  sound cliche ?  that's only the beginning .  billy zane ( memphis belle ) played the rookie , and never seemed to get a handle on his character .  he was so contrary and pig-headed in the beginning , you just wanted to smack him .  then he goes "" crazy "" from the pressure , but seems to immediately snap out of it .  i'm not sure if the blame should lie with the directing , editing , scriptwriting , or acting . . .  but it didn't all come together .  i think berenger is a pretty good actor , and he looked great in the part , covered in camo , face painted , stalking through the jungle with his high-power rifle . . .  but once again , his character was given some pretty bad dialogue , and didn't react too logically to many of the situations .  there was very little logical development in these characters .  my biggest problem with this film was it's tendency to put these two snipers in as * many * inches-from-death situations as possible .  they began to resemble g . i . joes , the greatest american hero .  and of course their almost supernatural accuracy with their guns was called upon to get them out of far too many close calls .  now a lot of movies are stamped out of this mold , in fact that's what made die hard so much fun : the super-hero avenger type .  so some will enjoy the action hero heroics , but i didn't think it fit with the nice tension that was built up in the earlier scenes , and the "" real life "" feel of covert operations in panama .  a word must be said on the camera work , much of it was very nice .  the jungles of panama ( or their stand-ins in this case ) formed a very picturesque background . . .  and the drama of speeding bullets was captured using some nice trick photography .  many have seen the slowed down "" bullet-cam "" following the projectile to its target .  this was used well in the beginning to show the feverish nightmares berenger gets when remembering the moment of the kill .  it was dramatic when used in flashback . . . but  it seems the director liked the technique so much he started inserting these shots ( pardon the pun ) into the real time action . . . then  it just seemed silly .  all in all , not a real dog : there is some nice action , good atmosphere , and pretty photography .  but the plot is pretty lame , the acting didn't form a cohesive whole , and far too much thisclosefromdeath heroics .

0|"1989's "" major league "" was a delightful surprise .  i didn't expect much of it when i decided to watch it on cable , but it proved to be fresh and funny .  however , when the appeal of a movie is its freshness , the sequels are virtually guaranteed to be stale .  that's certainly true of "" major league ii "" and the most recent entry , "" major league : back to the minors .

( note to the filmmaker : why did the character of lance make asides to the camera followed by silence that i'm assuming was inserted for the purpose of waiting until the laughter of the audience had subsided ? )  april's parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way .  the bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the "" circuitry "" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it .  mr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own .  i'm not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs .  either way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie .  the film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about "" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews "" .  if harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can't help but feel like he had some serious intent .  as for the entire central theme of the movie , i'm afraid that it's one that i just don't get .  i tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes .  it was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society .  how does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ?  i'm not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don't force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren't going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me .  again , maybe i'm missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully .  as far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy .  despite the disturbing visuals , "" mom and apple pie "" stuck with me for the rest of the day .  speaking of disturbing visuals , "" wedding bells ain't ringing "" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying .   "" i'm a lesbian "" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith .  it's mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based .  the other performers are decent , save for the rosie o'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan .  i have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired .  one particular musical number , "" lesbian rock "" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan .  the film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll .  the remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( "" lesbian rock "" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film .  once the "" isle of lesbos reprise "" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all .  why was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ?  isle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com .  the transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 .  in many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) .  this film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it .  if you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out .  i , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . .  wait . aren't gladiator films considered to be . . .  oh , never mind .
