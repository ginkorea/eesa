1|"every year , hollywood crowns a new "" it boy "" --a young actor pegged for major movie stardom .  inheriting the mantle from last year's "" winner , "" matthew mcconaughey , is matt damon , and , like mcconaughey , he proves to be more than just a fresh young face , as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grisham's the rainmaker and good will hunting .  damon has his first major starring role , a la mcconaughey , in a john grisham adaptation--in this case , francis ford coppola's take on the rainmaker .  damon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor , who , immediately after passing the bar exam , finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company .  while rudy's ( and the film's ) main concern is this case , he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue , in a mercifully brief role ) .  written for the screen and directed by coppola , the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously .  coppola's most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself , which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudy's unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance company's hotshot attorney ) .  the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous , but danes is as superb as always .  then , of course , there is damon , who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case , the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudy's often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat .  as good as he is in the rainmaker , damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting , directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself .  damon plays the title character , will hunting , a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius .  in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction , an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend , community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) , to counsel the abrasive , standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life .  good will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests , but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damon's intelligent script touches .  even though no one ( and , if so , _very_ few people ) can directly relate to will's burden of superhuman intelligence , the insecurities he suffers are universal .  the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors .  williams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck , a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy ) , turns up in a warm and charming performance as will's best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as will's harvard-schooled love interest .  the clear standout in the cast , though , is damon , who bravely does not soften will's prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him .  so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine , but based on his impressive work in john grisham's the rainmaker and especially good will hunting , it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come .

1|"synopsis : leonard shelby ( pearce ) is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife .  leonard has only a few clues to the murderer's identity ; to make matters worse , he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of short-term memories , meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier .  because of this , leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself .   "" memento "" traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination .  review : "" memento "" is the sort of movie i wish i'd written ; i can think of no higher praise than that .  i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant , involved , original movie as this .  an instant film noir classic , "" memento "" is virtually flawless .  the script is unlike any i have ever seen -- a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity .  although the idea of starting at the "" conclusion "" of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the "" start "" is not entirely new , never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence .   "" memento "" is endlessly exciting and inventive , a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself , and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre .  and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality ; there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively .  nolan's direction is equally effective , never losing its crispness and clarity despite "" memento "" 's challenging gimmick .  and to top everything off , all the performances rise to the occasion .  pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard ; moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie ; and pantoliano's teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality .

1|earth is a harsh , unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent .  people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict , as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim , hindu , sikh , parsee .  the story takes place in lahore , which was indian before partition , and pakistani afterward , regardless of what its citizens might call themselves .  the action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna ) , a young parsee girl , but it is really about her nanny , shanta .  shanta has a small circle of male admirers .  two of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna ) , a hindu , and dil navaz ( aamir khan ) , a muslim .  the others--sikh , hindu , muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta , who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das .   ( she also starred in deepa mehta's previous film , fire , the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . )  in an early scene , the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears .  one of the men remarks , jokingly , that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along .  he is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other , spoken like jokes , but with an undercurrent of fanaticism .  the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses .  it is easy to perceive , in these squabbles , the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter .  the group around shanta represents , in a sense , a united india , and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love , which inspires hindu , muslim , and sikh to live peacably together .  but the circle around shanta is sundered , as is the state .  a sikh is persecuted , hides , then flees .  another man is murdered .  the group of friends will not meet again .  the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor , a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child , and , most brutally , when the tension escalates into violence , a man is held down , tied between two cars , and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles .  it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully .  the crux of earth's plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz .  his sisters are killed in brutal fashion , by hindus , because they are muslim .  dil navaz seeks solace from shanta , and asks in desperation that she marry him .  but she loves hasan , and tenderly refuses dil navaz's offer .  the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him , and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate .  despite the things he later does , it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him , but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things .  the conclusion--the consequence of dil navaz's transformation--is rather abrupt .  the story earth tells does not end .  it just stops .  it is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted , at least on an aesthetic level , a sense of resolution , of satisfaction .  but there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war , on a small or large scale , for decades .  since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation , it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus .  there is no healing to be had , no closure , on any level ( despite the needless , tacked-on ending , with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult , framing the story ) .  earth is , in some ways , an unexceptional movie .  it does not reinvent the wheel , following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas .  but deepa mehta's directon is assured , and the issues she addresses run deep .  earth does for india what movies like zhang yimou's to live and tian zhuangzhuang's the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history .  such films strike me as inherently valuable , even when flawed .  they may be biased or inaccurate , but they bear the weight of human hardship , and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other , more inventive films , often lack .  it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago , but they still touch a nerve .  the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year .  in the near future , india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other .  at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth , i have a much , much better understanding .  |-0.4666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|0.8166666666666668|The text has a negative sentiment as it portrays the harsh and bitter conflict during India's independence from Britain, highlighting the violence and persecution experienced by different religious groups, and emphasizes the transformation of a character into someone who does monstrous things.
1|"up until about a year ago , john travolta's career consisted of those "" look who's talking "" movies ( notice how they never called them look who's talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) .  but somewhere along the line , travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again .  weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again , while barry , robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named "" size isn't everything "" ( and of course , they learned that sales are everything ) .  but now travolta's back on the hollywood scene once again , and i think we all know why .  four words : contract with the devil .  and this has nothing to do with newt gingrich's "" contract with america . ""  no , satan is much more humane .  anyway , yes , travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld .  how do i know ?  i own the document in question .  amazing what you can buy at those collector's shops for a few hundred dollars , isn't it ?  get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction , with travolta as crime minion chili palmer .  he goes to collect some of the mafia's money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game .  sure , a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood , but i guess that's beside the point .  palmer is determined to get hackman's next project made , so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie , bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo ) , who has already had affairs with hackman and devito .  it doesn't take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well , after the customary sexual tension and denial , which has been used in every comedy from "" who's the boss ? ""  to speechless .  it works in this case , unlike "" who's the boss ? ""  although it's interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also .  complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackman's other films and want in on this one too , along with travolta's mob boss trying to track him down for defecting .  get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction , despite the obvious similarities .  this movie doesn't have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies i've seen this year ( yes , even better than halloween vi ) .  get shorty is my kind of movie , one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence .  i'm definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on .  are you getting this , shorty ?

1|"i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory .  this was , of course , a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this .  not only did i get to see an advance screening , i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie .  the very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher , a fast-talking , witty , comical taxi driver in new york city .  gibson's performance is terrific , and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films .  gibson again teams up with richard donner , as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick , and this time around , the combination works even better .  the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique .  try to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who , this time around , is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups .  if you can imagine that , then you've basically got jerry fletcher .  in many ways , i was surprised by this movie .  to begin with , i was surprised at how good it was .  don't get me wrong , it's not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring , but it was a very enjoyable movie .  secondly , i was surprised at mel gibson's performance .  he provided a fantastic performance .  the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick , which after viewing , it was almost the opposite in a certain sense .  gibson's character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners , hilarious situations , and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film .  for instance , jerry's apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable .  and last , i was surprised at how good the plot is .  writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story , and when watching this film , you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletcher's far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgeland's own opinions .  mel gibson isn't the only stand-out in the film .  julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton , the department of justice employee who can't seem to stay away from jerry fletcher , who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories .  he also seems obsessed and in love with her .  but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories , she shrugs him and his beliefs off , continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him .  jerry , obviously determined to continually seek out the truth , continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory , which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) .  although he only has five subscribers , he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work , and publishes his next edition .  very soon after he does so , he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) .  after barely escaping alive , jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton .  the remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense , with jerry's life being constantly put into jeopardy .  and more along the way , the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerry's life .  many things are explained throughout this film , both to the characters and to the audience .  for instance , the meaning of the book "" the catcher in the rye "" and its ties to assassins , the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g .  lee harvey oswald and james earl ray ) , and the real truth behind the grateful dead .  make sure listen closely throughout the film , as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above .  definitely , when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th , make sure you are standing in line to see it .  i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film , especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations .  and even if you aren't , you should still like this film .

1|"the disney studios has its formula for annual , full-length animated features down so pat that it's hard to remember which one you're watching at any given moment .

"" )  farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds .  shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend .  they finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet .  for the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well .  the movie references a great many other flicks , from "" babe "" ( "" that'll do , donkey .  that'll do "" ) to "" the graduate . ""  but the lion's share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney .  the public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a "" possessed toy "" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , "" get that dead broad off the table ! ""   ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad's royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like "" it's a small world . ""  which brings me to disturbing point number one .  i laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad .  the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known .  for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other's film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day .  and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer .  here's a suggestion for the two boys : grow up !  put the past behind you !  there's room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can't play nice , then go to your rooms !  the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad .  beyond all the irreverence , "" shrek "" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within .  it's a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad's diminutive stature .  do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ?  the pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers .  adding short jokes is simply mean .  still , "" shrek "" is a rollicking good time .  the computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one .  to trot out a clich ? , "" shrek "" is fun for all ages .  parents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing .

1|"after watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film , you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again .  there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles , as a master would teach an eager apprentice .   "" you caress the noodles with the chopsticks , "" he says , "" then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying , 'see you soon . ' ""  of course , it's meant to be a parody , but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety .  you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat , not something you like , not something you enjoy , but rather something you experience .  experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses , fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts .  trust me , you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point .  juzo itami's tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western , set in modern day japan .  a stranger , goro ( tsutomu yamazaki ) , comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto ) , the proprietor of a small , hole-in-the-wall noodle shop , trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman , pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) .  goro , to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles , gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen , emerging bloodied , but victorious .  goro finds that tampopo's ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away , just to eat a bowl of her ramen .  the problem is , her fare is something less than popular , and less than appetizing .  however , goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest , and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert , enlist the aid of a wealthy patron , and make friends with the former enemy .  this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems .  take , for example , when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner .  the price is too high , but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum .  tampopo meets him at his store late at night , and he leads her to a back room .  she protests , thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives , but he insists .  just when she is about to bolt for the exit , he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door .  she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day , her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience .  this scene , while comical , is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation , then of relief and discovery .  there's also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who , despite their economic trappings , are all gourmets and master sommeliers .  we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet .  the scene is meant to bring a laugh , but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor , food is something which everyone has in common , and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all .  there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film , which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in people's lives .  a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor .  surrounded by her children , she is obviously in her last hours of life .  her husband comes home , and seeing her worsened condition , demands that she get up and make dinner .  the viewer knows the husband's intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived , and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this .  in a near miracle , the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal , then brings it to her awaiting family .  as the family eats , she looks on them and smiles .  preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her , and for a brief moment , she too enjoys the normalcy .  then she falls over , dead .  for a moment , the family is stunned , but then the father yells at the children , "" keep eating !  this is the last meal your mother ever made ! ""  crying as they do so , the family finishes the meal .  the scene is comical , awkward , moving , and beautiful .  by including the vignettes , itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film , but surprisingly , they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline .  instead , they even help contribute to the idea that tampopo's goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble .  because the film parodies a western , the construction of the plot is fairly predictable , but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the "" good guys "" come together for the final showdown .  in this case , the showdown is against the ramen .  if they eat tampopo's ramen , soup and all , tampopo knows she has succeeded .  it's pretty obvious what the outcome will be , but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life , you can afford to cut it a little slack .

1|there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last .  george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy .  return of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films .  the dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone .  instead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears .  even darth vader doesn't seem very intimidating this time around .  with the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman .  return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back .  luke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke's home planet of tatooine .  their goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt .  it is at jabba's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play .  from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba's sand barge , the effects are top notch .  as soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it's back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire's newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor .  so , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks .  there , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader .  return of the jedi has some interesting elements .  the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted .  from a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films .  not only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved .  on one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects .  in the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch .  the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films .  by now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas .  the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific .  as in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for .  newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he's not as imposing as vader was in star wars .  although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment .  with the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader's incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang .  congratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come .   ,  |0.8503000000000002|0.9007666666666667|0.8666666666666667|"The summary explanation for these explanations is that ""Return of the Jedi"" is highly praised and regarded as the most innovative, action-packed, and entertaining installment of the original Star Wars trilogy.

1|"why do so many children's films treat their target audience with utter contempt ?  too many of those who write or direct for children's movies assume that the kids just can't handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues .   "" the iron giant , "" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as "" the simpsons "" and "" king of the hill , "" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time .   "" the iron giant "" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that's enjoyable for both children and adults alike .  hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine .  after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception .  he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food .  after saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts .  because of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy .  realizing he can't just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time .  it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can't keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security .  he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth's house as a lodger .  meanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind .   "" the iron giant "" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn' t talk down to its audience .  the story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy .  it's very similar to the spielberg classic "" e . t . , ' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of "" the iron giant . ""  the film holds many of the better elements of spielberg's film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy .  the film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one's ability to choose one's own fate .  hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero .  the final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won't give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed .  the animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after "" tarzan "" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you're watching a cartoon .  the giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way .  the characters' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief .  fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother .  harry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv's "" frasier "" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley .  unlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn't ditched ) .  dean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations .  even the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia .  a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won't mind , but "" the iron giant "" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off .  the film isn't only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though .  it's also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy .  the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on "" the simpsons "" for many years .  a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to "" outlast "" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever .  the film even takes some jabs at america's nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to "" duck and cover "" in the event of a nuclear attack .   "" the iron giant "" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing .  instead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with .  when you get right down to it , "" the iron giant "" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot .  the story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming .  though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go .  it's akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it's not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which "" the iron giant "" has in spades .

 shortly thereafter , the president drives through , and people stare , with blank faces .  this is standard , but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew , triumphs over the anti-semitic society in which he = lives .  granted , _the great dictator_ comes to mind--charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece .  i think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax , but to do so , he had to break completely from character .  benigni is given a similar situation : he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary , and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race .  benigni+s guido stays in character , and delivers the speech , keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept .  it = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema .  there are many other scenes , especially in the first half , which are bright and loopy and funny and silly .  slapstick reigns , and although the film is subtitled , there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed .  and although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi , benigni+s real life wife ) , a silent undercurrent creeps in .  this is clearly a racist society , evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others , and it will soon affect him and = his family .  the second half of the film takes place five years later , in an unnamed concentration camp , where guido , dora ( by her insistence ) , and their five-year old son , giosu=e9 ( giorgio cantarini ) , are deported .  guido , seeing the horrors , is desperate to protect his wife and child .  for = his wife , who is separated from him , he must find ways to communicate to = her that he is all right .  for his son , ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game : it+s rules include hiding , being very quiet , and learning to not ask for seconds .  which raises the big questions : how do we deal with pain ?  with persecution ?  with injustice on the worst level ?  it+s said that tragedies bring out the best in people , finding strengths they did not realize they had .  other times they deteriorate , become overwhelmed = with little strength or incentive to swim .  sometimes even , people giggle in these moments , as if there were a vacant emotion behind them , yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds .  benigni+s guido realizes this .  he is the clown , but he is not a fool .  he sees the slurs and the vandalism , and while feeling the weight of = the verbal attacks , he still has the audacity to see if everyone around = him , perhaps even the antagonists , laugh .  his liberty is stripped , but not his dignity , and certainly not the dignities of those around him .  it+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation , but does so with a grinning , joyful demeanor .  perhaps that is a form of denial .  perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster ( not unlike the very different _brazil_ ) .  or . . .  perhaps this is an example of great fortitude , with no weapons but = wit .  whatever his purposes is subject to debate , but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three-dimensional characters , stranded amidst = a terrifyingly risky concept .  surprisingly , it works .  it is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust .  it+s not that the atrocities are trivialized , far from it .  they don+t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror--less is more .  i believe = that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone , and i like the theory that = it is guido+s alternate reality that we+re seeing .  however , any criticism that this is rewriting history , that the holocaust wasn+t as bad as it seems , is simply off-target .  benigni+s film has won audience awards at cannes , at toronto , and is a definite shoo-in for best foreign language film ( hopefully for best picture as well ) .  he has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society .  it swept the italian academy awards .  controversy notwithstanding , it is one of the great films this year , and as of this writing , the one to beat for best film .  masterful .  miraculous .  a must-see .  |0.8976666666666665|0.8666666666666667|0.9|"The film ""Life is Beautiful"" is described as overwhelmingly positive and highly praised, with words like ""great,"" ""stunning,"" ""touching,"" ""heart-wrenching,"" and ""miraculous.""

( he romanced winona ryder in reality bites .  he romanced julie delpy in before sunrise .  he romanced uma thurman in gattaca .  now in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow , a rail-thin blonde . )  hawke plays a lovestruck , earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film .  meanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess ; estella's whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate .  anne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms . dinsmoor , while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably .  the difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love , whereas great expectations ( 1998 ) is more artsy , less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with a lifetime tease .

( though shyamalan does , somewhat unforgiveably , crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . )  it's far more heartwarming than frightening , and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks .  cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown , but they're not out to harm him , really-they just want to be heard , even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler .  perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us , at first , than they really are because we're looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old .  that's right : willis , for the first time in years , gives up the spotlight to his costar .  we appreciate malcolm's domestic dilemma , but we identify with cole , recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed .  both actors deliver immensely likable performances , and their dynamic is manifest .  willis convinces us that he's a doctor , something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night .  osment is phenomenal , a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do .  the sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs' cinematographer , tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky , effective ad campaign is misleading .  only because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather , feel-the movie's running time , which is just shy of two hours .  the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait .  i'm not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof , but i admired its audacity .  |-0.0833333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|The text has a slightly negative sentiment, with mentions of not caring about a troubled character and scary ghosts, but the reviewer appreciates the performances and the unexpected finish.
1|"hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) .  it's a shame , too , because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters .  i mean , come on .  are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ?  hell no .  and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell , but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well , not commonly associated with horror films .  and not only has the idea been done too many times , but with the possible exception of from dusk 'till dawn , has not been done very well lately , either .  this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu .  i got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form , and not just done to make cash like nowadays .  and that is exactly what this film is ; art .  i've been a horror fan since i was eight years old , and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers .  let me backtrack a minute .  when i say "" intellectual ground "" , i don't mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that , i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to , a little bit of thinking is involved .  with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not , you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown .  those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen .  you see , this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore .  this is a thinking man's slasher flick .  the "" nosferatu "" of the title is orlock ( max shreck ) , a strange , hermit-like count that , as the film opens , is looking for a new home to buy .  he employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein ) , a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) .  upon orders from his boss , hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlock's castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutter's ) .  the next morning , he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . not  really a good sign .  he then discovers through some reading that the count is a "" nosferatu "" , or vampire , one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans .  but by the time he pieces this together , he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutter's hometown via boat .  will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ?  the character of orlock is , of course , dracula .  the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strocker's novel .  just thought that was an interesting little side note . . .  probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainment's digitally restored cut , now available in stores .  however , this version is quite different than maunau's original masterpiece .  the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting , much like the 1984 version of lang's metropolis .  now , i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here , bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one .  but alas , i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen .  but that's just my bag ; you may like the newer , more "" modern "" version better .  either way , i suggest investing your money in a copy .  if you like what they have done with it , pop it in the vcr and enjoy .  if you're like me , just do what i'll do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television , hit mute , turn on some bach or mozart or whatever , dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made .

1|stendhal's syndrome : a condition where , in the presence of art , a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression , suicidal behaviour and personality disorder .  grim stuff , to be sure , but the subject of a remarkable film from italy's master of the horror thriller dario argento .  boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone , the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento .  it follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 ) , the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980's .  based on the novel by graziella magherini , the film stars argento's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer .  visiting florence to follow up several leads , she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery , a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail .  at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints .  posing as a bystander , alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer , a strange game of cat and mouse begins .  a gripping story evolves , and a coherent one , too , which may surprise those familiar with argento's often lumpy narratives .  the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario .  it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character's psychological disintegration .  the script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour , perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers .  but as dark as its themes are , the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years .  argento is once again working in his native italy , and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences .  effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here , and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent .  the film's opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination , flashback and real-time with tremendous style .  proof that , at his most inspired , argento remains one of the world's most exhilarating filmmakers .  the cast is generally good , though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless .  asia argento's performance is by turns risky , awkward and fascinating .  it's a difficult role , and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts .  thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo , and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso , and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as anna's work colleague and increasingly confused love interest .  but perhaps the stendhal syndrome's single most striking element is ennio morricone's soundtrack .  active since the 1960's , morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts .  it's mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary , haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards .  it's been three decades since argento and morricone worked together .  this is a long welcome reunion .  if the film has a fault , it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesn't quite reach a completely satisfying climax .  but by the closing scenes , the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argento's career .   * note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can .  dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web .  |0.18333333333333335|0.8333333333333334|0.7333333333333334|The overall sentiment of the reviews is mixed, with a slightly positive tone.

1|"close your eyes for a moment , if you will , and imagine the sound of stephen rea's gaelic brogue , silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness .  a lackadaisical , naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols .  an acerbic , sing-song metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess' "" a clockwork orange .

""  imagine all of that , and you'll get a good sense of what you can expect from "" the butcher boy . ""  imagine that and more .  neil jordan's latest film "" stars "" rea in more ways than one .  rea , the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordan's "" the crying game , "" contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady , a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s .  but it's his wall-to-wall narration as the butcher boy of the title , da brady's son , francis , that makes rea's "" performance "" worth watching , worth listening to .  and that's only half the fun .  playing the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens and he is , without a doubt , a revelation .  for as much as rea's voiceover permeates almost every scene of "" the butcher boy , "" owens commands virtually every frame .  it's impossible to take your eyes off him .  with his crop of carrot-colored hair , ruddy complexion , and overall grubby appearance , francie brady is an unlikely hero , refusing to be done in by his alcoholic , trumpet-playing father , his depressive , suicidal mother , or the neighboring , bespectacled monster known as mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) .  in fact , everything was ok until "" the nugent "" came to town .  now , she poses as much a threat to the safety and security of town bully francie and his best pal joe ( alan boyle ) as the looming commie menace ( "" the butcher boy "" is set at a time when the fear of nuclear obliteration is first and foremost in the minds of many ) .   "" pigs ! "" screams mrs . nugent at the brady menagerie .   "" you're all pigs ! ""  it's the start of many a related image .  after ma brady is shipped off to the "" garage "" for psychiatric observation and da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many , francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world of cowboys and indians , the lone ranger , and other comicbook characters .  squealing like a stuck pig , francie does "" the likes o' that "" on the nugent's living room floor , and is himself whisked away to a very catholic remand home for "" boney arsed bogmen , "" where his ever fertile imagination--and clever chicanery--runneth over .  director jordan's vivid treatment of pat mccabe's nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing , dark comedy littered with surreal touches ( such as sin ? ad o'connor playing the virgin mary ) .  it's not as outlandish as the trailers make out ; instead , this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship between two boys ( schoolboy chums in real life ) , allowing us to empathize with their plight in the presence of extraordinary behavior .  it's bleak and it's black but it's fundamentally very funny .  rea talks us through it , beautifully , and owens drags us though it , admirably , and , in tandem with jordan's sure hand , theirs are contributions to make "" the butcher boy "" a film worth savoring .

1|"zero effect gets its title from the main character , daryl zero ( bill pullman ) , although we don't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film .  zero is a private investigator , perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least he'd like to think so ) .  however , he's a socially inept being , and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are .  zero's accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller ) , a "" normal "" guy who does the business side of the job -- he's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero's greatness as an investigator .  the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero's talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan o'neal ) .  it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box , and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about .  zero takes the case , and the plot thickens .  his path leads to a young , pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) .  despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence , she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark .  through his investigations , zero learns why , but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that , because of his reclusive behavior , are new and confusing to him .  i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film .  i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators , and , every once in a while , a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually , no private eye film has ever reached chinatown's greatness ) .  zero effect , which is jake kasdan's first effort as writer/director , is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : it's an original , funny , and completely involving motion picture .  with so many cliches available to this genre , i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them .  but he didn't just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here , one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment .  take , for starters , the great cast of characters .  pullman is terrific as zero , showing a comic flair that i really haven't seen from him since spaceballs .  zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that he's an almost exaggeratedly twisted , emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe .  pullman's performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance , and the occasional voice-over as he's going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious .  ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; he's the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny .   "" i'll shoot you , "" he says to stark at one point .   "" i have a gun , and everything . ""  his character is also well-drawn , with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job .  o'neal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens , last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising , gets a chance to show us her talent here , giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs .  i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film .  kasdan's humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken , and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) .  it's the kind of humor that's funny even after you've seen it five or six times .  there's one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is , an how that makes him such a great detective .  what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed , or standing motionlessly , with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face , his eyes pointing to something off camera , but obviously to nothing in particular .  i can't convey to you how funny this is , but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent , and they provide solid characterization of zero .  as a side note , i don't consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not , and vice versa .  there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film , and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it .  i have a feeling the humor here won't appeal to everyone , but there's certainly enough story and character development to keep anyone's interest .  jake kasdan , son of writer/director lawrence kasdan , is only 22 years old .  i found this out after seeing the film , and i can't remember ever being so impressed with a film maker .  his direction is stylish without being pretentious , and his writing is mature , full , and developed .  zero effect is the kind of film that i'll buy for my collection -- smart , original films like this are rare as it is , but this one actually has a heart and a soul .  at the end of the film , i was involved in the characters , and i was satisfied with the outcome .  and , with kasdan's undeniable talent at such a young age , all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future .

1|"the long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed .  even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets .  however , geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight , a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband , renny harlin .  davis plays samantha caine , a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years .  with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson ) , she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore , tough-as-nails cia operative .  needless to say , with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory .  shane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; i'm not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag , but for what it's worth , it delivers the goods .  like black's previous work , such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout , the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny , quirky dialogue .  the humor especially works well in this case , for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously .  but there's no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . .  while ice skating ?  jackson and davis make a good team .  jackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact , his spirited line deliveries , especially when he first appears , are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction .  as good as he is , the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis , who shows much promise as an action heroine .  what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesn't take herself too seriously .  she is obviously in on the joke , slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation .  this is not to say that she doesn't need work--sometimes she lays on the "" toughness "" a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature .  but should the public embrace the film and , in turn , the notion of a kick-ass female , davis could have found her special niche .  it seems as if davis and harlin's first collaboration , the middling pirate epic cutthroat island , was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss , in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride .  anyone simply looking for a fun , escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss .

1|screen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker .  screenplay by andrew kevin walker .  inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving .  directed by tim burton .  starring johnny depp , christina ricci , and casper van dien .  special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken .  synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation .  townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them .  cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery .  comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years .  batman , of course , is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels .  he's done biographical work ( on the director ed wood ) , children's movies ( nightmare before christmas ) , and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) .  sleepy hollow , his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while , shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies .  sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s , especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein , and american international's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe .  christopher lee , in fact , star of many hammer productions over the years , appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders .  the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s .  one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein .  i mention these allusions for a reason .  seasoned horror film fans , including myself , will smile at their inclusion in this film .  with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies , especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade ) , we needed a film like this .  not only does it have a sense of history , but burton's skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror .  the film's eerie landscapes and foggy towns , indeed , overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie .  johnny depp , a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands , plays ichabod crane , who has apparently changed occupations from irving's original story and is now an investigator .  depp is adequate in his role .  no more ; no less .  equally adequate is christina ricci , who plays the love interest in the film .  she's a good witch too .  how cute .  one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters .  the two actors , however , carry the movie well enough , but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine .  veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers .  while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points , i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing .  you have to pay attention .  andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay .  he's the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven .  walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood , and sleepy hollow certainly doesn't hurt his growing reputation .  as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker , sleepy hollow is quite graphic .  there's a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings .  this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to .  a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngest's eyes with her hand .  he was obviously upset by the movie's intense violence .  if you're looking for a good scare , however , sleepy hollow is definately recommended .  |0.3833333333333333|0.8000000000000002|0.8000000000000002|The sentiment of the explanations is generally positive, with praise for Tim Burton's directing style, the film's dark and atmospheric tone, and the eerie landscapes and setting.

"" drunken master "" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to "" make it big "" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong .  i'm not entirely sure why , exactly .  in many ways , "" drunken master "" is similar to most of jackie's other early films , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii , "" master with cracked fingers "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , "" spiritual kung fu "" , and others .  in fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories .  to be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste .  they're quite different from action movies as we know them in america .  these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together .   "" drunken master "" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception .   ( as an aside , "" drunken master "" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in  a movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival .  at the time , i didn't really think it was anything special . . . but  after having seen more films like it , it's kind of grown on me . )   "" drunken master "" 's storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as "" fearless hyena "" i and ii and "" master with cracked fingers "" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been "" adapted , "" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) .  more specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka "" naughty panther , "" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough .  after embarrassing his instructor's assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and  is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively .  his father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages .  kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all .  while escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more .  this turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu .  he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up .  then , when he's ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu .  unfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . .   "" drunken master "" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others .  it's been said before , but i'll say it again--these fights don't just _happen_ , they're as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows .  in his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways .  the fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films .  whether jackie wins or loses , it's really something to see . . . and  it's often as funny as anything , too .  and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at .  there's very little that's new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these  schticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties .  but they're still hilarious as ever .  likewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they're often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own .  the really big thing about "" drunken master "" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu .  i'm not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and  it apparently helps if you're drunk while you're doing it .  genuine or not , i have to admit , there's just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what's going on .  come to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film's success over any of the other jackie films . . . it's  not just martial arts , it's the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , "" whoa . . . ""  on the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background .   "" gone with the wind "" , this isn't .  still , if you like martial arts films , or like what you've seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot .  it's much more "" real "" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme .  you might very well like it .  another interesting thing about "" drunken master "" has to do with its video availability in the us .   "" drunken master "" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) .  there are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase .  thankfully , "" drunken master "" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price .  if you like "" drunken master "" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren't really _too_ bad . . . if  nothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) .  i particularly recommend "" spiritual kung fu "" , "" half a loaf of kung fu "" , the "" fearless hyena "" movies , and "" snake & crane arts of shaolin "" .  also , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , "" drunken master ii "" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer .  also , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i've been told to suggest the "" once upon a time in china "" series starring jet li ( though i haven't personally seen any of them yet ) .  if you choose to watch "" drunken master "" , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that's out there .  all in all , i give this film an .

However, there is also mention of appreciation for the fight scenes, martial arts sequences, and Jackie Chan's comedic skills, which slightly balance out the sentiment.
