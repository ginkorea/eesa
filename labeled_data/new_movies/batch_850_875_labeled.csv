1|buffalo ? 66 is a very rarely known movie that stars vincent gallo and christina ricci .  gallo plays a very troubled man , who was sent to jail for gambling .  once out of jail , he must visit his parents , who he told he was married .  the truth is he isn't married .  to try to impress them , he kidnaps a girl ( christina ricci ) from a tap dancing class to act as his wife .  the film is very cheaply made , and it shows it throughout a lot of the movie , but you don't need money to make a good film .  buffalo ? 66 doesn't always stay with the realistic concept , and sometimes goes through outrageous events .  gallo's parents , played by angelica huston and ben gazarra , are two very strange individuals .  the mother plays a football fanatic and the father plays a quiet man with odd habits .  gallo and ricci arrive at his parent's house , and some extremely funny scenes take place within the house .  ricci's performance during the scene at gallo's parent's home are very well done .  there is constantly humor involved in the interesting dinner table scenes .  the way the movie was filmed in this particular part of the movie were interesting and creative .  they seemed very mediocre , but they worked out just fine .  gallo's character is developed very well .  the impression that he is very depressed and confused is very clear .  gallo gives a performance that makes you believe what the character is going through .  his character goes through many , many problems , just like many people in real life .  this character seemed very realistic to me .  ricci's character is funny and different .  she doesn't care much that she has been kidnaped , in fact , she falls in love the man who kidnaped her !  ricci is a very wonderful actress and she is starting to get the recognition that she deserves .  buffalo ? 66 isn't all laughs though .  many scenes are very dramatic and depressing .  gallo's character was so realistic , he was extremely disturbing .  some scenes are supposed to come off as funny , but they actually seemed sad and real to life .  the film sometimes drags along , not giving much material .  i really would have liked to see gallo's parents a lot more , and i would have liked to see the characters developed more .  overall , buffalo ? 66 isn't as good as some people put it up to be .  the bottom line- a few hysterical scenes save this film from sinking to the bottom .  |0.3666666666666667|0.9|0.8666666666666667|The overall sentiment of the text is slightly positive, with praise for the performances of Vincent Gallo and Christina Ricci, as well as the humor and creativity of certain scenes.

1|"after being hypnotized , a man believes there is a ghost in his house .  the review  two low-key summer horror films have become surprise financial successes this year : the blair witch project and the sixth sense .  each has made well over $100 million in north america , based on a combination of strong word of mouth and clever advertising .  if a film's box office take were based primarily on its quality , stir of echoes would join blair and sense in grossing far more money than expected , for it is as scary , if not scarier than the other two .  writer/director david koepp has given artisan entertainment , the folks who distributed blair witch a second creepy hit .  the story gets going after tom witzky ( bacon ) , an average blue-collar dad , gets hypnotized by his wife maggie's ( erbe ) sister lisa ( douglas ) at a party .  while the hypnosis goes as expected to the party-goers , it triggers something in tom's head .  things begin to change around him ( blinking red lights let off a strange hum , for example ) , and he fights to stay in control of his own senses .  where these experiences take tom , maggie and their son jake ( cope ) , who tom thinks might have some answers , is down a dark path that will scare and disturb you .  david koepp keeps the action localized ; the majority of the action takes place at tom's house or just down the street .  by keeping things at home , koepp is able to proceed without having to resort to any clumsy segues ( montages of driving down roads as we move from one city to another etc . ) .  unfortunately , the dread and spookiness of stir of echoes are frequently interrupted by moments of levity .  humour can take the tension away from a scene faster than any shoddy special effect or poor acting .  several tense moments become completely diffused by a few misplaced jokes .  also , there are a couple of plot developments that are left unresolved , though to mention them would be to give too much away .  kevin bacon handles the duel task of playing an everyman and a man losing his sanity admirably .  his total lack of understanding of what is happening to him is believable , as are the reactions from his wife maggie .  kathryn erbe is given a role meatier and better written than that of most "" wife who can no longer handle her husband "" parts .  while it is still a supporting role , her maggie is moving as she watches both her husband and her son enter what she calls "" a private club that i'm not invited to "" , where they whisper about things all day long .  as jake , zachary cope equals the performance of haley joel osment in the sixth sense , but gets less screen time .  both children manage the same trick , making the audience creeped out by their apparent acceptance of the way things are .  fans of blair and sixth sense will almost surely love stir of echoes .  it combines the dread of blair , a creepy closed-in feel thanks to cinematographer fred murphy and great performances by the whole cast , specifically bacon , to give the fall its first genuine scary film .  if only they had let up on the unneeded funny bits and tweaked the plot a bit more , this could have been one of the year's best .

1|"being the self-proclaimed professional film critic that i am , i am somewhat embarrassed to admit that i had not seen lawrence of arabia ( coming soon to dvd ) until only recently .  after all , it's considered by just about everyone to be the masterpiece epic of director david lean , who also directed films such as bridge on the river kwai , and doctor zhivago .  so one day , a friend of mine loaned me a copy of the video and i sat down and watched it .  i was initially skeptical that something made almost 40 years ago would be able to keep my attention for the butt-numbing 3 1/2 hours of its duration .  but now i fully understand why this has become the film that other epic films are judged against -- the winner of seven academy awards in 1963 for best picture , director , editing , cinematography , art direction , music , and sound .  after watching the film again , i am convinced that it is simply one of the finest works of cinematic genius to ever illuminate the big screen .  based on the autobiographical writing of british officer t . e .  lawrence during world war i , lawrence of arabia depicts lawrence ( played by then-unknown actor peter o'toole ) as a lieutenant lacking any sort of military discipline whatsoever .  bored with his assignment of coloring maps for the british army in a dimly lit headquarters building , lawrence jumps at the opportunity to be re-assigned as an observer for an arabian prince fighting against the turkish army .  lawrence quickly sees just how caring and great these desert dwelling people can be and ends up rallying the various tribes together to fight the turks and help the british turn the tide of world war i .  shot in panavision's famed super 70mm format , the film beautifully illustrates the definition of the word epic .  it is absolutely breathtaking .  using stunning cinematography , costuming , and direction , shot in the most uninhabitable location on the face of the earth , i can only imagine what it must have been like to sit in a theater in 1962 and watch this story unfold before my eyes .  every shot is choreographed as a portrait -- a living tribute to a great land .  david lean put his reputation on the line to get this film completed , and the fact that it was even greenlit in the first place says something about the ideology of the motion picture industry at the time , a far cry from its pathetic , uncreative existence today .  after watching the film , the first thing that came to my mind was , "" i've got to do a remake of this film ! ""  but then i thought about trying to pitch the idea to a modern-day movie executive : "" okay , it's going to be almost four hours long and shot over three months on location in the sahara desert .  we are going to need to blow up a full-size train because computer-generated effects probably wont do it justice .  and we are not going to use any big stars , and won't have any female actors since there's no love story . ""  yes , my friends , the velvet curtain fell on the golden-era of hollywood a long time ago .  but at least we still have the proof to show all would-be producers and directors out there just how good a film can be .

1|"my summer was recently saved by two very different movies .  on opening night , i saw american pie 2 and laughed like a moron .  then a few nights later , i watched and thoroughly enjoyed joel hershman's greenfingers even though it didn't feature a trip to band camp , girl-on-girl action , or seann william scott .  however , i felt just as good leaving american pie 2 as i did after leaving greenfingers , which tells the offbeat tale of british murderer colin briggs ( clive owen of croupier ) .  after spending roughly half of his life behind bars , he is transferred to a more lenient facility , edgefield .  the picaresque , rustic prison allows its inmates to learn a trade , while enjoying accommodations generally found at most colleges .  at first , briggs doesn't want to be there .  he's used to living as a prisoner and wants to be left alone .  however , his ailing roommate , fergus ( david kelly of waking ned devine ) , wears briggs down through his benign nature .  the two become friends , with fergus giving colin a packet of violet seeds as a christmas gift .  briggs is astonished when the violets grow in the limestone soil , and begins a fight with three other prisoners when an errant soccer ball smashes his beloved flowers .  after the prison's governor ( warren clarke ) reprimands them , he's awed at what briggs has accomplished .  and he's struck by an idea -- briggs , fergus and the other men will grow a garden on the prison's grounds .  greenfingers , which is "" inspired by actual events , "" becomes a bit like a sports movie after that .  despite their differences , the men come together and through hard work and love earn a spot at the big game -- in this case a prestigious garden show .  one renegade , in this case , briggs , will prove to have talent .  of course , love will also rear its head ( no , not "" prison love "" ) .  to hershman's credit , he doesn't pump up the drama or try for cheap laughs , like last year's lame marijuana comedy saving grace .  i had to keep pinching myself when i didn't see a single scene of a hardened con sneezing over a pot of pansies , or the men giving high-fives over a particularly stunning batch of wildflowers .  the movie deals with people and scores on that concept .  it's wonderful seeing briggs turn from a bitter prisoner to a man who cares again .  give credit to owen for keeping his cool in a part that begs for overacting .  his speech to the parole board about being reborn through gardening is the best scene of its kind since morgan freeman's last stand in the shawshank redemption .  owen's bedside scenes with kelly , who lends the film a human touch , are a marvel to behold , emotionally gripping without being sappy .  written by hershman , greenfingers contains plenty of laughs .  most come courtesy of helen mirren , who shines as the world-class gardener who works with the inmates but fears for her daughter primrose ( natasha little ) when she starts dating briggs .  the mother can't believe what he'll do if her daughter "" burns the sunday roast . ""  nothing is forced in greenfingers .  the funny lines come forth naturally in conversations and not from punch lines .  primrose and briggs' relationship takes awkward steps .  even when briggs decides to go back to edgefield , it's done for reasons of loyalty , not because the movie requires him to do so .  after grimacing through the forced screwball antics of movies like america's sweethearts and the princess dairies , it's an almost indescribable pleasure to see a director taking his time to tell a story very well .

( a+ ) he is very strange in this film as well .  i like him in this sort of role , rather than the roles he has been playing in comedies such as senseless and she's all that .  michael vartan is fantastic as chris , who has extremely mixed emotions about the entire murder and the 4 . 0 .  michael vartan was also superb in never been kissed , where he co-starred with drew barrymore as a teacher who fell in love with his student .  keri russell also gives a great performance .  she should be a good actress in the horror department of the film .  tamara craig thomas is also realistic , especially coping with the death of her boyfriend .  some very strong supporting performances came from smaller roles , such as bo dietl and anthony griffith who play two detectives investigating the case .  the bottom line- i might just have to curve that a- into an a .   * note- the curve premiered at the sundance film festival in early 1998 .  it was decided the film would not be released widely .  it is now available at blockbuster video only , and for rent only .  see you at the video store !  |-0.43333333333333335|0.7666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|The text has a slightly negative sentiment due to the mention of dark themes like murder and suicide, as well as negative behavior.

1|"available for rental - october 12 , 1999  10 things i hate about you is an update of the classic play , the taming of the shrew .  that said , drop any pre-conceived notions of what shakespeare's work is supposed to be like and welcome yourself to padua high school , home of a student counselor ( allison janney ) who obsesses over the male penis ; a slightly too hip and racist african-american english teacher ( daryl mitchell ) ; a new kid named cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) ; a model named joey ( andrew keegan ) , the subject of cameron and joey's crushes ; bianca ( larisa oleynik ) ; and bianca's sister - the shrew ( julia stiles in a marvelous performance ) - whose name is katarina , kat for short .  with movies about high schools similar to these running through projectors like water down the nile , it would be quite easy to write off 10 things i hate about you as just another doltish comedic-romance .  yet , you must realize that the story is timeless , and a few hundred years later it is equally as witty and comical as when elizabeth gleefully looked on , groundlings below and stuffed brassieres on stage .  the first reminder of the original scribe can be found in katarina and bianca's last name : stratford .  their family is run by walter stratford ( pretty woman's larry miller ) , a doctor who is all too familiar with teenage pregnancy and guards his children accordingly .  in what he thinks to be a moment of ironic humor , the family "" no dating "" policy is amended to "" bianca can date . . . when  [katarina] does . ""  with prom just ahead , bianca's fate is grim ; unless , of course , she can tame the shrew .  don't think this mission to be a simple one , as bianca kindly points out , her sister "" . . . is a particularly hideous breed of loser .

""  in this case , that is joey - the other guy with a crush on bianca .  cameron's friend , a loser by teenage verdict , convinces joey to pay someone who has enough guts to take the shrew out .  the solution lies no farther away than the second blatant reminder of the master scribe : patrick verona ( heath ledger ) .  this verona is far from fair ; rumor has it that he previously laid his scene in prison .  moreover , katarina openly opined to the aforementioned english teacher that "" hemingway was an alcoholic who hung around picasso , hoping to nail his leftovers . ""  the laws of high school cinema inexorably turn patrick and katarina into romeo and juliet .  providing a constant reminder of the fact that this isn't exactly what shakespeare had in mind are the elements obligatory to a high school comedy : a party polluted with liquor , a best friend's betrayal , and prom .  it is the latter that has become infamous for closing films like drive me crazy , american pie , never been kissed , carrie , she's all that , and can't hardly wait .  yet surely even these practices have roots in shakespeare ; falstaff was a drunk , romeo and juliet met at a party , and caesar learned about loyalty the hard way .

1|"my filmcritic . com  colleague norm schrager nailed session 9 , brad anderson's throwback to spooky horror films from the 70's .  it worked as an eerie homage without being self-referential or smugly postmodern .  genre aficionados will acknowledge the similarities in tone to stanley kubrick's the shining and george romero's dawn of the dead without being taken out of the engrossing narrative ( i . e . , a psychologically addled waste management team clears out an abandoned lunatic asylum ; unspeakable dread ensues ) .  in a double-whammy for 2001 , anderson shoots and ( mostly ) scores again with his eclectic riff on time-travel episodes from the twilight zone , appropriately titled happy accidents .  much like session 9 , the cards are played very close to the vest here .  is boyish , eccentric "" sam deed from dubuque , iowa "" a futuristic voyager from the year 2470 or just your run-of-the-mill psychologically disturbed nutcase let loose on the present-day streets of nyc ?  as played by wonderful character actor vincent d'onofrio ( full metal jacket ) , it's up in the air whether or not we should accept his detailed monologues about life after the polar ice caps have melted .  the question proves to be moot , at least for a time .  even if the whole thing proves to be a creative delusion , one agrees with the character judgment passed down on him by his new girlfriend , ruby ( marisa tomei ) : "" he's a freak , but he sure tells a good story ! ""  neurotic ruby thinks she may have found true love after a series of nightmarish dating disasters ( the junkie , the fetishist , the artist , the frenchman , etc . ) , but isn't quite sure how to handle "" sam deed "" when he starts explaining the barcode on his arm , his elaborately constructed fake identity , his pathological fear of dogs , his ability to speak five different languages , and his mission to change a crucial moment in time that may have ramifications on time's alternate realities .   ( don't ask . )  it's all a bit much to take in .  ruby's close friend gretchen ( cuz ya can't have a love story without the token friend , though nadia dajani invests the thankless role with warmth ) chalks it up as a sexy role-playing game , but her cautious therapist ( holland taylor ) warns her that co-dependency is rearing its ugly head again and she's in over her head with yet another doomed relationship .  who ya gonna believe ?  despite her winning an academy award , marisa tomei has always struck me as an annoying and unwelcome screen presence , one that undermines the pleasure of watching happy accidents .  her brassy new yawk attitude never really meshes with her desperate desire to appear "" cute "" to her adoring fans .  being loud and flashing a ( disingenuous ) smile does not necessarily equal "" substantial and sexy . ""  it takes more than a crack team of hair and wardrobe people to imbue her with personality .  then there's that damned voice , which strains to be oh-so-adorable .  look , this stuff is purely subjective .  some people feel this way about richard gere , others cannot bear to watch robin williams' hyperactive schtick .  for my money , it's m . tomei with a bullet .  happy accidents is a romantic comedy filtered through twelve monkeys ( or , more appropriately , chris marker's la jetee , especially with those still framed "" memory "" photographs anderson employs as a stylistic device throughout ) .  modern manhattan is filmed with an otherworldly , vaguely alien eye with a color scheme oddly reminiscent of logan's run .  as the stranger in a strange land , d'onofrio walks slightly out-of-step , wonderfully affable but often inscrutable with his wayward expressions and bemused detachment .  this is science fiction told mainly via the power of suggestion ( though it often falls into the sci-fi trap of having entirely too much forced exposition -- we want deeds , not words ! )  at least twenty minutes too long , happy accidents eventually gets around to a race-against-time scenario that puts "" sam deed "" to the ultimate test .  no movie can live in ambiguity forever , but anderson seems terminally unable to provide satisfactory conclusions to his otherwise well structured recent narratives .   ( let's pretend the loathsome and predictable next stop wonderland never happened , shall we ? )  there are also some slow , repetitive stretches as ruby and sam go over the same arguments again and again over whether or not he's crazy .  the premise is strong enough to sustain interest , but it's enough to throw a nod in the general direction of rod serling for wrapping up his ideas in half-hour time slots , commercials included .

1|what i look for in a movie is not necessarily perfection .  sometimes a movie has such strong ideas that despite whatever flaws it may have , i will prefer it to a better-made film that is not as thought-provoking .  the thin red line is flawed but it provokes .  terence malick returns to filmmaking 20 years after days of heaven and produces this meditative look at war .  unlike this year's saving private ryan , which dwells on war as a necessary evil and explores the moral ambiguities thereof , the thin red line simply says war is waste .  while that might seem obvious to some , only after experiencing the film do you realize how profound a waste it is .  saving private ryan has an underlying and practical acceptance that war will occur and it has a great cost ; the thin red line says idealistically avoid this at all costs .  one message is not necessarily more correct than the other .  it just depends on one's point of view .  in malick's film , war is set in a tropical paradise , and john toll's cinematography is beyond lush .  the setting poses the question , why are we fighting in the face of such beauty ?  in saving private ryan , the capture of a german soldier presents the moral quandary of whether to let him go .  in the thin red line , the japanese present the moral quandary of war in the first place .  they are just like the americans -- frightened and angry , grieving and praying .  all that separates them is war .  the flaw in the thin red line comes in the voice-overs .  unbelievable as coming from the characters and sometimes pretentious , sometimes corny , the voice-overs tell us what the images before us already do and are completely unnecessary .  dispensing with them , malick could have achieved a tarkovskian grandeur .  instead , he gets distracting self-consciousness .  aside from that , malick's direction is stunning .  the tracking shots across windswept hills and around transports speeding toward shore are extraordinary .  sean penn , elias koteas , and nick nolte give the best performances .  penn is subtle as a sergeant trying to hide his humanism , koteas is genuine as a compassionate captain , and nolte startling as a colonel whose blood vessels are about to burst if he cannot win his battle .  john travolta and george clooney are the worst in cameo roles .  ultimately however , the thin red line's interest is not in the characters and it is not in drama .  it has been frequently criticized for its lack of dramatic structure , but malick clearly has different things on his mind .  has no one ever thought that getting dramatic entertainment from war is exploitative ?  what malick is working with is theme , and in that , the thin red line is most provoking .  |0.2712333333333334|0.8166666666666668|0.8166666666666668|"The explanations highlight the thought-provoking nature, strong ideas, and stunning visuals of ""The Thin Red Line,"" while also acknowledging its flaws such as unnecessary voice-overs and lack of traditional structure.

1|"mike myers , you certainly did throw us a ? frickin' bone here in what you call ? the biggest austin powers adventure yet . '  austin powers : the spy who shagged me is the sequel to the 1997 smash comedy austin powers : international man of mystery .  many are skeptical about sequels , saying that the sequel is never better or as good as the original , but austin powers : tswsm goes beyond the first film .  austin powers : the spy who shagged me stars mike myers in three different roles .  he reprises his role as the title character , austin powers , the shagadelic spy whose body was frozen in 1967 , and unfrozen in 1997 to stop his long time nemesis dr . evil , also played by mike myers , from destroying the earth .  tswsm leaves off where the original stopped , with dr . evil's ? frisch's big boy' space capsule floating through space .  dr . evil returns back to earth by ejecting from his capsule , plotting to go back in his time machine to the year 1967 , in which he plans to steal austin powers' "" mojo "" , what keeps austin going with spy talents .  upon his return to his secret lair , which is now a starbucks coffee shop , dr . evil learns that his evil henchman , which includes the returning robert wagner as number 2 and mindy sterling as frau , have created a 1/8 size clone of dr . evil , which is later named mini me .  the evil mini me replaces scott evil , played by seth green , as dr . evil's son in the madman's mind , because dr . evil thinks of scott to be only "" quasi-evil . ""  dr . evil has always wanted a son that is evil just like him , and now he has one .  dr . evil tells mini me , "" you complete me , "" in a loving manner .  dr . evil loving ?  wow !  mike myers' third role is as fat bastard , a scottish henchman of dr . evil's , who is sent to steal the mojo from austin powers' frozen body .  austin powers learns of dr . evil's trip back into the 60s , and uses his own time machine to take him back to 1967 , to try to save his mojo before fat bastard gets a hold of it .  once arriving in the year 1967 , austin travels to his "" pad "" , his smashing home/dance club , where he meets felicity shagwell , played by heather graham , a cia agent who is willing to help him in his journey to stop dr . evil .  as the film progresses , hilarious one liners are thrown at us , mainly by dr . evil , for example , "" don't go there , girlfriend ! ""  to the president of the united states .  many witty gags take place , note the entire tent scene , and just plain , funny scenes which are so stupid- they're funny come a dozen per fifteen minutes .  take for example , scott evil going on the jerry springer show complaining about how evil his father is .  the way austin powers : tswsm uses its humor is clever , throwing a hilarious scene at you , followed by five minutes of one liners , followed by another outrageous scene , so you never stop laughing .  there was honestly not one moment in austin powers : tswsm where i wasn't laughing .  the last film that i laughed so hard in , was well , austin powers !  it is apparent that mike myers knew how funny this film was while writing it .  the film even makes fun of itself in a line , something along the lines of , "" it's funny how england and southern california look nothing alike . ""  tswsm was filmed in southern california , but was supposed to take place in england .  i can tell you one thing- he is having a lot of fun with this enormously popular character , which is all over television , newspapers , magazines , and the movie theaters .  i believe that dr . evil got more attention in the tswsm than austin powers did .  dr . evil provided more laughs , more memorable moments , and more interesting dialogue than austin did this time around , who seems to missing the funny touch that he had in the first film .  i felt that austin really did have his mojo taken away , but from screenplay writer mike myers , not fat bastard .  also making a great addition to the series is mini me , who is played by verne troyer .  even though the midget actor is 30 years old , he is adorable by dr . evil's side constantly .  the first austin powers film had barely any sentimental quality , such as lack of character development , barely any detailed plot characteristics , and barely any good acting , but austin powers tswsm actually shows some quality behind the frequent humor .  mike myers , with his three roles , acts as eddie murphy did in the nutty professor , disguising himself completely in one of the roles .   ( fat bastard ) all three characters are different , and mike myers does do a good job handling each one of them .  heather graham made a great addition with her talent to tswsm , and does a much better job than elizabeth hurley did , who gave a very flat performance in the original , speaking her lines without any feeling or emotion .  speaking of hurley , she can be seen in tswsm for a few brief moments .  hopefully , graham tags along for future austin powers adventures .  the bottom line- a groovy sequel that mike myers put all of his mojo into writing .

1|"it is with hesitance that i call "" apocalypse now "" a masterpiece .  certainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970's .  the plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad's "" heart of darkness "" , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war .   "" apocalypse "" certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history .  the plot is fairly simple .  captain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty .  his mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) "" with extreme prejudice "" .  along the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt . col . kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies .  willard' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives .  willard's experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending .  the movie is visually breathtaking .  the battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate .  the collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening .  the vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie .  the journey to kurtz' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character .  the most interesting one is kilgore , the lt . col . who cares more about the surf than about the mission .  it is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie .  the scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne .  the narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz .  coppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like "" saving private ryan "" on lsd .  the film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution .  the problems come when the film slows down .  one of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess .  the dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film .  the true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound .  the film slows down to a drag .  sheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received .  brando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic .  the scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief .  sheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told .  the entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations .  granted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion .  brando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ?  there are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene .  there are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending .  the finest scene at the end is sheen's escape , and his entrace into the temple .  his rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film .  yet , you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done .  the psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good .  it is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man's mental stamina during bouts of war .  but one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful , had the character of kurtz been more explored , and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for .  there is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece , but it could have been so much more rewarding .

1|"the verdict : spine-chilling drama from horror maestro stephen king , featuring an outstanding , oscar-winning performance from kathy bates .  geez , french and saunders had a field day when they set to work on parodying this !  sorry , non-british readers may not be familiar with french and saunders - my apologies .  the pair are british comediennes ( jennifer saunders later went on to become edina monsoon in "" absolutely fabulous "" ) , who did a series of film spoofs a few years back , including alien , the exorcist and misery .  needless to say , amidst her chucklesome impersonation of kathy bates ( the resemblance was quite uncanny ! ) , dawn french got pretty nasty with her sledgehammer when in reach of jennifer saunder's legs !  but despite the lingering memory of their sketch , and although i've now seen the film a couple of times now , that "" hobbling "" scene was no less disturbing !  i'm still left screaming at the telly in revulsion !  that may be the most memorable scene , but it's certainly not the only worth watching .  stephen king , whose film and tv adaptations tend to vary in quality , strikes gold with this simple yet strikingly compelling tale .  it's a nicely crafted psychological horror , which effortlessly succeeds in drawing you into the plight of writer phil sheldon ( james caan ) .  rescued from a car accident by annie wilkes ( bates ) , who introduces herself as the writer's "" number one fan "" , he soon becomes her prisoner .  both the script and kathy bates' beautifully masterful performance ( for which she won an oscar ) work arm-in-arm as we quickly begin to realise that beyond her bubbly exterior the woman is basically as nutty as a fruit-cake ( or is that fruity as a nut-cake ? ) .  bates relishes her demanding role , and her performance is nothing short of a masterpiece .  at times she seems like an innocent victim of her own obsessive behaviour , at times she's a rather tragic character , and more often than not she's just damned scary !  this is basically a very simple tale , but it achieves a large degree of eloquence in its simplicity .  it's an involving , engrossing experience - and considering it's basically a two-hander , mainly set in one locale , it's a remarkable piece of cinema .  there are no jazzy special effects or cheesy action sequences - this one relies solely upon rob reiner's stylish directing and the wonderful performances of bates and caan .  oh , i haven't really mentioned caan yet - he does a good job as the writer who's a prisoner of his own success ( annie is obsessed with him and his books ) .  but , as you no doubt gathered from the above - bates is well and truly the star of the show .  along with the pig , of course !  anyway , the tension is built-up with masterful aplomb , and some scenes are almost agonisingly tense .  there's the dinner scene where seldon goes to nerve-shattering lengths to poison her wine .  he succeeds , but . . . she  knocks the glass over !  i bet you threw a pillow at the screen as well !  in the immortal words of homer j . simpson - "" d'oh ! ! ""  other nerve-wracking scenes include the bit where annie has gone off to town and sheldon starts snooping around the house .  we cut to annie in her car - she's on her way home . . . he  realises this and tries to get back to his room . . . cut  to the car again , she's getting near . . . will he make it ?  ok , so these sequences aren't exactly original , nor perhaps unpredictable - but they work !  boy , do they work !  if a film has you on the edge of your couch , biting your nails and shouting at the screen in suspense , then it's doing something right !  of course , the most nauseating sequence is the aforementioned "" hobbling "" !  annie realises her captive has been out of his room , and she's going to stop him once and for all .  cue a block of wood placed strategically between his ankles and a huge sledgehammer , and . . . i feel ill just thinking about it !  nasty .  it all builds up nicely to the final scene where sheldon finally gets the upper hand , and once and for all tries to kill the crazy psycho !  and then we're given one of the most ridiculously over-the-top fight scenes i've ever seen .  she gets hit over the head with a typewriter , set on fire , head smashed against the wall - and she just won't die !  sheldon isn't in terribly good shape either .  if it weren't so gorey it would almost be laughable .  but it's a terrifically effective film , and therefore the daft climax is easily overlooked .  misery is a tight , tense , intense and chillingly entertaining thriller .  the directing is first-rate , and the performances - bates in particular - contribute to making this a suitably nightmarish little gem .  wonderful stuff .   ? - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - for more regularly-updated film and tv reviews , check out my site !  http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/bungalow/4960  - * - * - * - * - * - * - * - * -  "|0.7666666666666666|0.9|0.9333333333333332|The overall sentiment towards the movie is extremely positive, with high praise for the performances, directing, and overall effect of the film.

1|an indian runner was more than a courier .  he * became * the message he was carrying .  what danger is a bear , to a message ?  i used to think sean penn was an immature , arrogant , photographer- punching , madonna-marrying , loudmouth .  but all that has changed now .  the guy has grown up .  and that's not all .  it seems that sean penn has talents both as a writer and a director , if this film is any indication .  one might imagine a movie with plenty of ruthless rage and showy machismo , given penn in charge of bronson and and hopper .  but , no .  this film is about a real struggle , and the victories and defeats are not simple .  penn lets the story unfold at a pace dictated by the lives of the characters , without unnecessary rush or flash .  the focus of the story is two brothers .  david morse is the brother who has grown up in the small midwestern town in which they were raised , tending a failing farm and finally becoming a police officer .  viggo mortensen is the wild brother , whose wild behavior seems to be a reaction to some ancient pain that he can't name , much less resolve .  the film picks the story up on the day when mortensen returns from vietnam , and morse coincidentally encounters an armed youth fleeing for the state line .  it becomes clear that some kind of conflict threatens the link that the brothers once shared .  the film is unobtrusive , simple , direct , plain , and sincere .  it isn't exactly perfect , but its sincerity is well invested in the struggle of the two brothers to identify the sickness before it destroys them .  life seems to move forward a little faster than they can get a handle on their problems .  this is a good film without big budget sets , or big name stars pushed into your face .  in fact , i'm reviewing it because i suspect that it may not get much marketing .  there were perhaps 10 others at the showing i saw .  i thought the structure was clean and not oversimplified , though there are a few free-form sections which also work very well .  the obligatory 1960s music seemed a little cliche , but what are you going to do--this movie * does * take place in the 1960s after all .  in my opinion , it is worth full-price admission .  |0.11666666666666665|0.8833333333333333|0.85|The overall sentiment of the explanations is mixed, with a combination of initial negativity towards Sean Penn and the film, followed by a change in opinion and praise for Penn's growth as a writer and director, as well as the unobtrusive and sincere nature of the film.

1|"seen july 8 , 1998 at the crossgates cinema 18 , ( albany , ny ) , theater #7 , at 8 : 15 p . m . with my mom using hoyts cinema cash .  [theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats]  it's very rare that any medium of entertainment can give one an authentic , vivid sense of reality and life .  all stories are about select moments of time and places in the characters' lives , but only the truly great ones are able to define their realities well enough so the audience can experience it just as the characters do .  therefore , "" gone with the wind "" deserves accolades for its ability to tell the epic story it does , in such a crafted , intricate , and entertaining manner .  it's a crowning achievement , not only in filmmaking , but for storytelling itself .  the film takes place in georgia before , during , and after the civil war .  this plays a major factor in the film's success .  to use such a historic setting presents many possibilities and problems since no one was alive at the time to verify its accuracy .  it might also seem cliche , boring and other such deterent factors to potential viewers .  can a story set so long ago be relatable now ?  the film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them .  it doesn't simply plug in the "" right thing "" at the "" right time , "" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant .  building a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ?  we're given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time .  she knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her .  right from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be .  being the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e .  who will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i . e .  getting married just to spite someone ) .  the man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him .  he isn't so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he's engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his .  her name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see .  she and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband .  her meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn't give her much emotional self-defense .  acting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable ) .  he's quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he's got a bad reputation .  butler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior .  he tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn't seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition .  for example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there's no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out .  this angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that .   "" do we have ammunition factories ?  do we have food ?  do we have a navy ?  all we have is tobacco . ""  all true statements and yet the south still insists he's wrong .  butler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it's appealing .  scarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he's not going to stop until he has her .  but scarlett can't get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever .  and so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life .  the conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is "" marked "" for life when her first husband dies .  this gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story .  some are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film .  in most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance .  even people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set .  the costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place .  the filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken .  the first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war .  fleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is .  one scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , "" no !  not my leg !  don't cut off my leg ! ""  another scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that's more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be .  as the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north .  she manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can't help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south's ultimate defeat .  this brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship .  most of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett .  each uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other .  scarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can't help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business .  they say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization .  they need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together .  perhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call .  both have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other .  love and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we're left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why .  gable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture .  all ?  none ?  either way is possible and it's a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings .  it's safe to say most of us won't live such overly dramatic lives as those in "" gone with the wind , "" but it's still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we've just experienced a life's worth of joy and pain .

1|"not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies .  like bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations .  also like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters' ravished and wracked faces .  and the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman's own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film .  all that is missing is a discussion of god .  which is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master .  in fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind .  nonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film's rhythms .  once the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards .  one such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is .  though leigh may have adopted some of bergman's stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married couple's strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any "" style "" at all .  whereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary .  the effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors .  it is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting .  much has been made of brenda blethyn's performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is .  there are a few missteps .  for one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film .  this leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout .  and occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced .  for all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention .  it is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film .  in fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it .  there is even a sweet but significant irony in the film's unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe .  nonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart .  though there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen .  needless to say , it is also very depressing at times .  but for many of us , of course , so is life .  and though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better .

1|"after a successful run in australia last year , and with much critical praise heaped upon it , muriel's wedding opens into medium release this weekend in north america .  muriel heslop is a withdrawn , overweight young woman living in porpoise spit , australia .  she is often the target of her father's frequent rants at the family , and drowns out her feelings of inadequacy with abba music and fantasies of marriage .  her self-loathing is such that only being wed shall she prove herself to be a success ; marriage will transform her into a new person who is respected and admired .  after her four cliquey friends dump her , muriel plots to follow them to a resort where they are celebrating the honeymoon of one of the girls , and muriel's wedding unfolds from there .  toni collette plays muriel in a winning performance , conveying both the sadness of her character and her desperate eagerness to be accepted .  collette gained a frightening 43 pounds in order to play the chubby title character .  she has a natural screen presence and exudes charisma , easily winning the audience over with an honest , painful performance .  collette basically carries the film , appearing in almost every scene .  muriel's father , bill "" the battler "" heslop , is portrayed by bill hunter as a slick politician/developer .  while chumming around with young fans and crowing 'you can't beat progress' ( his slogan ) , bill labels his family as worthless and embarrassments .  rachel griffiths plays rhonda , who becomes muriel's cheeky new friend in the film .  she has good chemistry with collette , and the film suffers when griffiths is off-screen .  muriel's tormenters , played by pippa grandison , rosalind hammond , belinda jarrett and sophie lee , are two-dimensional caricatures , all saucy , vain and bumblingly spiteful , though that is probably due to hogan's scripting  muriel's wedding is essentially a genre teen comedy with more intelligence and a lot of charm .  hogan's use of abba tunes ( which virtually comprises the entire soundtrack ) is interestingly appropriate , although its repetitiveness tires after awhile .  hogan's script is right on the mark in terms of proportionately mixing comedy with muriel's earnest quest for acceptance , and the gorgeous scene with muriel window-shopping beautifully illustrates the wonder that marriage has for her .  the glaring pastel colours worn by the performers is an interesting touch .  muriel's wedding features a fine performance by toni collette and a charming , if a bit too straightforward and conventional story by p . j . hogan .  on my four star scale , i give muriel's wedding three stars .

1|"every once in a while , a film sneaks up on me and takes me completely by surprise .  i don't necessarily mean in terms of quality ; rather , i'm referring to the mere knowledge of its existence .  usually i know what films are on the way a year in advance , but two weeks ago i had never heard of princess caraboo .  it has slipped rather quietly into limited release , and appears destined to slip out just as quietly .  that's a shame , because princess caraboo is a delightful fable , romantic , gentle and very appealing .  what's more , it's surprisingly insightful and provides a sharp-witted lesson in english social history .  princess caraboo is based on an actual event in early 19th century england , involving a young woman ( phoebe cates ) who is found wandering the countryside .  apparently unable to speak any english , she is taken in by good-hearted gentlewoman mrs . worrall ( wendy hughes ) .  her banker husband ( jim broadbent ) is none-too-pleased about this strange houseguest , until the worralls begin to believe that the woman may be royalty from an east indian island , the princess caraboo .  this development inspires plans for a lucrative trading venture for mr . worrall , and an introduction into elite social circles for mrs . worrall .  however , local journalist john gutch ( stephen rea ) is not convinced that the woman is what she seems to be , and sets out to find out the truth about princess caraboo .  as a social satire and comedy of manners , princess caraboo is a winner .  it takes place in an era when it was common practice in england to jail vagrants and hang beggars , and that practice comes in for an obvious hazing .  but it is handled most effectively through the character of mr . worrall , a drunken womanizer whose bank is in deep trouble thanks to his corruption and ineptitude .  he is worse than one of the idle rich ; he is one of the actively odious gentry so eager to distance themselves from the lower class they think nothing of simply eliminating them , and since the house and money are all from mrs . worrall , he is a bit too close to them for comfort .  while hypocrisy is an easy target for ridicule , director and co-writer michael austin keeps the treatment too light-hearted to be heavy-handed .  he also takes a unique stab at the trendiness of the upper classes , as the princess becomes a "" sensation "" at court .  in one of the film's best sequences , princess caraboo is the guest of honor at a party hosted by the prince regent ( a wonderfully foppish turn by comic john sessions ) , and the lords and ladies end up following her around in a thoroughly silly native dance .  it is then that princess caraboo shows how easily people are swept up in "" sensations , "" an idea that takes on a timeless quality ( and makes the film an interesting companion piece to the current quiz show ) .  social commentary aside , princess caraboo is simply an eminently enjoyable entertainment .  the performers are mostly delightful , particularly phoebe cates , who is radiant in a part that requires a gift for pantomime .  her supporting players are also appealing : wendy hughes as the patient and kindly mrs . worrall ; kevin kline as frixos , the worralls' suspicious and superior greek butler ; stephen rea as the world-weary but ultimately romantic gutch .  only john lithgow is a disappointment , turning in a limp performance as a scholar who attempts to verify the princess's identity .  the story twists and turns just enough so that the question of whether or not the princess is really a princess is always in some doubt , without becoming gimmicky .  it is unfortunate that the growing attraction between gutch and princess caraboo isn't given more time to develop , because the potential seemed to be there .  when it finally does blossom , it seems too quick to be plausible .  princess caraboo is patient enough in establishing its sense of time and place that it might seem a bit slow to viewers seeking a fantasy romp .  still , it has both escapist and intellectual appeal , and is well worth seeking out .  it is the kind of film that makes my job its most rewarding--a hidden gem .

1|" "" through a spyglass , i could see everything . ""  king louis xvi was beheaded on january 21 , 1793 , but instead of visualizing this act of regicide , legendary auteur eric rohmer's the lady and the duke observes from afar .  consider it a view to a kill made abstract .  a proper british ( yes , british ) gentlewoman , grace elliott ( lucy russell ) , and her loyal maidservant gaze from a lofty terrace in meudon at the glistening city of paris , where raucous crowds seem tinier than ants .  the maid narrates what little she sees of the execution through her telescope ( often muttering , "" i don't know , "" ) as the sound of cheering patriots and revolutionaries echoes through the air .  what we don't see might not be able to hurt us .  just close your eyes and think of england .  during times of revolution , the aristocracy may feel a false sense of calm in their parlor halls , discussing tumultuous events over glasses of sherry until the walls cave in on them .  adapted from elliott's memoirs , journal of my life during the french revolution , rohmer's latest artistic tour-de-force may seem far removed from his domestic comedies ( tales of the four seasons , etc . ) , a period film set during the most violent changes in french history .  resisting the temptation for grand-scale theatrics , much of the lady and the duke is about quiet , decisive moments between members of the cultural elite as they determine how to proceed as the world implodes .  grace elliott makes for an unlikely protagonist : a headstrong , snobbish blueblood , one unprepared for the machinations of history that sweep her along .  a foreigner who accepts the french king as her own , grace's life seems defined by fancy attire and lively political debate with her former lover , the king's hot-blooded cousin , prince philipe , duke of orleans ( jean-claude dreyfus ) .  the times are changing , though , and the gears inch ever closer toward violence .  during the september massacres of 1792 , she is encountered by a procession of rioters brandishing the head of the duke's sister-in-law on a stake .  rohmer makes a harsh transition from tranquil , old fashioned , almost stagy parlor scenes to the swell of an angry mob .  in doing so , he achieves what braveheart and the patriot could not : the face of death .  when grace sees her friend's disembodied head on a pole , rohmer's attention drifts from the societal change to one woman's reaction shot , laden with hot tears .  grace finds herself taking in a fugitive from justice , sheltering him from the mob .  through her relationship with the duke , she seeks a passport for this one activist's escape .  grace doesn't even understand her own actions ( and the duke reacts in stunned disbelief at how she places herself in such danger ) .  she endures persecution from robespierre and his gang of thuggish equalizers , ceaseless police monitoring , house searches , even a brief imprisonment for harmless international correspondence .  maintaining her stiff upper lip and pampered life ( her imperious attitude to the servants never changes ) , she becomes a heroine through circumstance .  the events themselves are intrusions upon her person , her home , and therefore her values .  aristocracy proves a glass house , one that can barely withstand the upheaval of stones .  the duke is called to vote on the king's punishment , and despite his hours of deliberation with friends and advisors , talk means nothing in the face of bloody action ( or futile inaction ) .  the episodic structure creates a wobbly , jarring detachment from the events of the french revolution , which serves as metaphor but also disconnects potential audience identification .  lazy viewers ( and critics ) may also complain that knowledge of french history is required for enjoyment of the lady and the duke .  that's foolery , but brings up the valid criticism that rohmer's characters occasionally become didactic .  rohmer's imperfect but assured push toward the future remains staunch and notable for casting a cautious eye upon the past while taking bold steps forward into an uncertain future .  what may arouse interest in the lady and the duke outside of foreign film enthusiasts with literary and historical passions is rohmer's use of cutting edge digital technology as a means of exploring the theme of artifice as safety net or coping mechanism .  the actors were filmed against a bluescreen , then placed against painted backdrops recreating the vastness of 18th century paris .  this recreation calls attention to itself in every shot , a technicolor dream of fanciful buildings and wide-open streets .  it looks as phony as titanic , but unlike james cameron's debacle , the lady and the duke plays with the notion of false security in those walls of stone .  why ?  they aren't real .  the very foundation rohmer's characters stand upon is false , and in their groundlessness they must discover themselves , in all their insubstantial glory .  screened at the 2001 new york film festival ( feature coming soon ) .

1|"wong kar-wei's "" fallen angels "" is , on a purely visceral level , one of the most exciting films i've seen in a long while .  unfortunately , wong seems more interested in experimenting with his camera than creating tangible characters for the audience to root for .  ordinarily , that alone would be enough to sink a movie , but in the case of "" fallen angels "" , this is not so .  every shot in this film is exciting just to * look * at .  wong does really interesting things with the camera , but he doesn't allow the pyrotechnics to completely take over , as was the case with last years dismal "" knock off "" ( which contained a shot of a foot entering a shoe .  ugh . )  the movie follows three pairs of lost souls as they struggle to find some meaning in their lives .  i can't say much more than that as i didn't really know what was going on most of the time .  in fact , it wasn't until about halfway through the movie that i was able to distinguish between each character .  the constantly moving camera doesn't really allow for the audience to associate with any one character .  we're always kept at a distance from these people , i suppose in order to further add to the feeling of alienation felt by the characters .   "" fallen angels "" is a refreshing change-of-pace from most hollywood films , which never bother to try anything different , at least on a visual level .  in fact , i'd go so far as to say that "" fallen angels "" is more challenging visually than any mainstream hollywood film i've ever seen .  sure , there's directors like robert rodriguez who enjoy turning violence into operatic orgies of death , but to see a filmmaker like wong who actually assaults the senses with images is truly something worth celebrating .  but if wong wishes to become a legendary filmmaker , he needs to work on incorporating an actual story into those awesome images .  there were far too many instances during "" fallen angels "" in which i asked myself , "" now who are these people again ?  is this that first couple or the second couple ? ""  it was impossible to keep track .  perhaps he could let the audience know right away which character is which , by introducing them to us with "" name cards "" , as in scorsese's "" mean streets "" .  that's really besides the point , though .  wong kar-wei has proven himself , through very few films , that's he's a movie-maker to watch .  let's just hope that he hones his storytelling skills with his next few movies .

1|"city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental .  i find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality .  city of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years .  it's a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we're so used to seeing in films like this .  city of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders' 1988 film wings of desire .  i have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two .  i have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn't a rip-off of its source material .  nicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) .  one day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her .  the angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can't experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch ) .  he shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status .  seth wants to become human so he can feel her .  that's when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , "" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . ""   ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . )  messinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human .  seth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel .  this , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it's like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead .  since i love this film so much , i'll make a minor note that it certainly isn't perfect .  although it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre .  the plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them ) .  the ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable .  these elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels .  the acting is superb from everyone involved .  this is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) .  he's quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words .  he's perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he's not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face/off ) .  meg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly-chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best .  dennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel .  what i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation .  director brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality .  his direction is steady , and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning , maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead .  there is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information .  this is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real .  the film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do .  cinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i've seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) .  the music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it's quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely .  the visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far .  all of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre .  it's a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously .

1|"have you ever wondered if death is something that simply happens naturally , at any given moment , in life ?  or if it is an occurrence that is predetermined by some much larger force within the world , or outside of it ?  these thought-provoking questions are the subject of "" final destination , "" which is the most riveting horror-drama since 1999's "" the sixth sense . ""  stylishly filmed and tautly directed by "" x-files "" alum james wong , the film deals with several fairly heavy topics that are discussed truthfully by teenage characters ( in accurately written "" teen-speak , "" rather than overwrought , highly intellectualized dialogue that even harvard scholars wouldn't use ) , all the while developing into a darkly foreboding , severely eerie thriller that successfully leaves you uneasy from the horrifyingly real opening twenty minutes to the less-successful , but still suspenseful epilogue .  at the start of the film , 17-year-old high school senior alex browning ( devon sawa ) is about to leave with his 40-student french class for a field trip to paris .  progressively getting a case of preflight jitters , he spots several mysterious "" coincidences , "" including the departure time being 9 : 25 , the same as his september 25 birthday , as well as hearing the john denver song "" rocky mountain high "" over the sound system in the airport bathroom .   "" john denver died in a plane crash , "" alex grudgingly mutters to himself .  once seated , alex suddenly gets a horrific premonition about the plane exploding upon takeoff , and after causing a ruckus onboard , he , as well as six other students and a teacher , are thrown off .  arguing in the airport lobby , alex's suspicion comes true when the plane really does explode in flight , killing all 300+ passengers , including the rest of their classmates .  as two investigators interrogate alex about how he knew the plane was going to explode , the fellow survivors , whom he has saved , treat him in varying manners .  carter ( kerr smith ) , the hotshot jock , holds him in contempt because he believes that it is only he himself who can decide his fate .  alex's best friend , tod ( chad e . donella ) , wants to stand by him but can't because of his fearful parents .  the teacher , mrs . lewton ( kristen cloke ) , is frightened by him , believing that it was he who somehow caused the disaster , as well as in a state of guilt for giving up her seat on the plane to a fellow coworker .  only outsider clear rivers ( ali larter ) , who unboarded the plane due to a sudden connection to alex's premonition even though she had never even spoken to him before , is sympathetic and thankful to him for saving her life .  that is only the setup of "" final destination , "" and the less said about what follows , the better .  suffice to say , the film does , indeed , turn into a slasher film , albeit one that is more thoughtful than most , and replaces a knife-wielding maniac for the never-seen granddaddy killer of them all , the grim reaper itself .  the setpieces in any horror movie are the death scenes , and "" final destination "" surely boosts some of the most inventive ones to grace the silver screen in years .  graphic and brilliantly orchestrated in a rube goldbergesque manner , they manage to occasionally be so intense you don't know whether to shrink down in your seat , tap your feet in nervousness , or turn away .  devon sawa , a rising star who put his physical comedy skills to good use in 1999's underseen slasher-comedy , "" idle hands , "" is even more of a charismatic presence here .  the conflicting emotions he feels for his survival , which he comes to believe he wasn't meant to do , as well as the loss of the other passengers , is superbly and subtly acted on his part .  one scene , in which he is watching a news report on the crash and slowly begins to break down is especially realistic and powerful .  ali larter ( 1999's "" varsity blues "" ) , in the other central role , is also effective , as a girl whose life was going well until her father died in a convenience store shooting years before , leaving her stuck with an increasingly uncaring mother who married a loutish man--the exact opposite of her now-deceased father .  the other roles are not as fully written , and most remain rather one-dimensional .  the movie is mainly sawa's , however , and the rest of the actors equip themselves well in limited roles .  tony todd ( 1992's "" candyman "" ) , as an arcane morgue attendant , pops up for a five-minute cameo , but his appearance is rather supererogatory .  and the aforementioned dialogue occasionally hits the bullseye , while at other times it hovers over being just a little too stilted and campy .  ultimately , what is so good about "" final destination "" is that , within the confines of the slasher genre , writer-director wong and screenwriters glen morgan and jeffrey reddick have created a premise that has never been seen before in this manner , and a film that has the ability to both surprise and frighten--two things that are rarely found in today's horror films .  if anything , it's safe to say you will never ever look at flying in airplanes the same way again .

""  ---agent swanbeck ( sir anthony hopkins ) , the series' new agent phelps , takes ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) down a notch .  a russian scientist ( rade serbedzija ) has created a new virus ( and its antidote ) called chimera that destroys its host within twenty hours of injection .  a rogue imf agent , sean ambrose ( dougray scott ) , wants to use the disease and cure to blackmail a pharmaceutical company into selling him enough stock to make him owner of the company ( he knows it will soon be worth its weight in gold thanks to the outbreak of the virus he is going to cause ) .  posing as ethan hunt , ambrose gains the confidence of the scientist long enough to get only the cure , not realizing that the scientist had injected himself with the virus to prevent exactly what ambrose was trying to do .  the real ethan hunt is called in from his vacation to persuade beautiful thief nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) to assist the imf team in retrieving the stolen goods .  ethan and nyah fall quickly in love , but ethan soon finds himself in a real dilemma when he learns that his new love has only been hired because she was a former lover of ambrose's .  reluctantly , he sets up nyah to be rescued from prison by ambrose so she can infiltrate his compound and send back intelligence to the team .  ethan must race against time to keep ambrose from obtaining and spreading the virus and prevent any harm from coming to nyah .  although the first mission : impossible film was a moderate box office success , audiences panned it because they felt the plot was too confusing and there wasn't much action ( although being a fan of the series both old and new , i thought the movie was pretty decent and especially gutsy to make phelps a bad guy ) .  that problem has been rectified in the sequel by making the plot more accessible ( courtesy of one of the writers of the previous entry , robert towne ) and by turning the film into one gigantic action set piece under the steady hand of action film guru john woo .  the end result is one of the most entertaining ( yet simple ) action films made in a long while .  unfortunately , the first forty minutes or so are relatively slow , dwelling mainly on ethan and nyah's quickly blossoming romance and seeming more in place in a james bond film than with the less glamorous mission : impossible tv series .  ethan's conflict is a compelling one , but it seems very rushed ( and comes about because of a near fatal car wreck that ethan himself causes ! ) .  john woo handles all of this with an artistic flair that seems out of place , featuring a great deal of slow fades and dramatically framed close-ups .  the surreal nature of these sequences are distracting and ultimately a detriment to the film .  thankfully though , at the point ambrose discovers nyah's deception , mission : impossible ii becomes very entertaining and action-packed .  robert towne's screenplay takes some of the conventions set up in the first film and parodies them during a sequence where ethan must break into a high-rise building and retrieve the remaining specimens of the virus .  after that , the action scenes just begin to build in intensity , as is the case with many of woo's previous high-octane films .  the final half hour is an all out assault of action ( a good deal of which is ruined by the trailer , unfortunately ) .  as far as summer entertainment goes , mission : impossible ii is serviceable fare .  anyone looking for hardcore action won't be disappointed ( except for during the first half of the film , perhaps ) .  even if you weren't a fan of the first film , this entry deserves some checking out .

1|"robert redford is very good at playing characters who have incredible , god-given gifts , but are able to act like ordinary people .  in "" the natural "" ( 1984 ) , he played the fallen angelic character of roy hobbs , the baseball player who was destined to be "" the best there ever was , "" but still acted like a humble farm boy .  in "" butch cassidy and the sundance kid "" ( 1969 ) , he was the most dangerous shot in the west , yet he came off like a nothing more than a boyishly good-looking charmer .  even in "" indecent proposal "" ( 1993 ) , where he played a man who was so good at making money that he believed he could buy love , redford was still able to exude an aura of shy decency , especially when reciting a tale of lost love .  in his latest film , "" the horse whisperer , "" based on the best-selling novel by nicholas evans , redford again plays such a character .  redford also directed the film although he swore up and down that he would never direct himself in a movie - i suppose the character of tom booker , a man who has the amazing gift of understanding and somehow communicating with horses , was just too good to pass up .  despite his enormous and rare gift when it comes to training troubled horses ( a magazine article coins the phrase "" horse whisperer "" to describe his uncanny talent ) , booker sees himself as an everyday cattle rancher whose greatest fear is growing old and no longer having a purpose in life .  booker's talents are taxed into service by annie maclean ( kristin scott thomas ) , a new york magazine editor whose daughter , grace ( scarlett johansson ) , was recently in a horrible accident .  the accident , which is filmed with gut-wrenching horror , happens when grace and her best friend are out riding horses - an eighteen-wheeler kills grace's friend , severely wounds and traumatizes grace's horse , pilgrim , and causes grace to lose part of her right leg .  annie believes that if pilgrim can be healed , grace will be healed as well , which leads her to booker .  at first , she tries to get booker to come to new york to see the horse , but that doesn't work .  instead , she packs up grace and pilgrim , leaves her husband , robert ( sam neill ) behind , and heads for the rolling hills of montana where booker runs a ranch with his brother , frank ( chris cooper ) , and his sister-in-law , diane ( dianne wiest ) .  in many ways , the film is like a journey , both literally and symbolically .  the move out west has always been a great american tradition of renewal , and it's hard not to see annie and grace's leaving manhattan for montana as a variation on the classic theme of city vs . country .  in "" the horse whisperer , "" country is clearly the victor .  the city is characterized by claustrophobia and unhappiness , and it is not until the characters arrive in the wide-open spaces of montana that grace's anger at being physically and emotionally crippled begins to dissipate , annie's controlling nature begins to relax , and pilgrim once again learns to trust people .  redford is just as in love with the grand montana country in this film as he was when he directed "" a river runs through it "" six years ago .  in many ways , "" the horse whisperer "" comes from the same poetic vein as "" river , "" and the movie could probably be a good fifteen minutes shorter if redford had decided to spend less camera-time on the grass and mountains .  but then , that would ruin the magic .  much of the film's photography is truly elegant , and it creates a palpable sense of the sheer expansiveness of the land .  to further emphasize this , redford and cinematographer robert richardson ( "" natural born killers , "" "" platoon "" ) cheated a bit by shooting the beginning of the film - which takes place in new york - with mostly cold , harsh bluish filters and a more squarish 1 . 85 : 1 aspect ratio ; when the action shifts to montana , richardson switches to soft-focus and natural lighting , and the screen widens to a 2 . 35 : 1 aspect ratio .  in terms of the story itself , "" the horse whisperer "" gives us the same romanticized view of adultery found in david lean's "" a brief encounter "" ( 1945 ) and clint eastwood's 1995 adaptation of robert james waller's "" the bridges of madison county "" ( richard lagravenese , co-screenwriter here also adapted "" bridges "" ) .  although "" the horse whisperer "" has a strong romantic sensibility , i still find something oddly troubling about this kind of story .  it seems to me that there should be some sympathy for the husband who's being left behind for this brief , heart-sweeping affair , but there rarely is .  in "" the horse whisperer , "" the thankless role of being the fuddy-duddy husband falls to sam neill .  he plays the character as a decent , hard-working man who is a good husband and father ; his only failure is that he loves his wife more than she loves him .  he is at risk of losing annie to booker not because he did anything to drive her away , but simply because he happens to be a normal , fairly uninspiring man .  there is one scene that is particularly telling of how the movie feels about each character .  it shows booker and robert going into a horse pen - booker is dressed like a classic cowboy with hat and all , while robert looks somewhat frumpy and out-of-place in a baseball cap .  as they enter the pen , booker assuredly swings over the fence , while robert hesitates , then opens the gate and , in a goofy moment , forgets to close it behind him .  it's a small scene , but it clearly demonstrates the movie's thorough love of the booker character for his romantic roughness .  after all , booker represents everything good about the city while robert represents everything banal and unnatural about it .  the best scenes in "" the horse whisperer "" tend to involve not the building romance between booker and annie , but rather the healing process of grace and her horse .  although booker's horse-training methods are mythical and unrealistic , the scenes with him and pilgrim are strangely mesmerizing .  these are paralleled by the scenes between him and grace , some of which are humorous , and all of which are tender and true .  at some point , i wished the movie would drop the whole romance angle and focus on grace more .  nevertheless , redford is obviously a romantic at heart , and he brings a light touch to the erotic moments in the film .  there are no dramatic sex scenes , but there is a moving scene when he and scott thomas are slow-dancing , always moving ever closer together , that is far more erotic than any scene of sweaty bodies grinding together .  although the movie is longer than it should be and is essentially a melodramatic tearjerker with an unsatisfying conclusion that guarantees unhappiness for just about every character , there are enough moments like that which make "" the horse whisperer "" worth the price of admission .  "|0.7833333333333332|0.8666666666666667|0.9|In summary, the explanations all express a positive sentiment towards Robert Redford's acting abilities, praising his portrayal of characters with extraordinary gifts who remain relatable. The explanations also highlight the beautiful cinematography and scenes involving the healing process. However, some mention that the film is longer than necessary with an unsatisfying conclusion.
1|"in roger michell's romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it's name to the film's title .  one day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey .  quickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat .  the film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna's stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress's appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such .  without words , this sequence gives us a background to her character .  following , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives .  i don't know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn't have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie's beginning , but there it is .  if there were ever a clear case for "" less is more , "" this would be it .  the film is told nearly first person from william's point of view , as he is in every scene .  by nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily .  in fact , much of notting hill's strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis .  a scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he's even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator .  or take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image .  william assures her he wouldn't say a word , then adds , "" well , i'll probably tell myself now and then , but i'd never believe it . ""  great stuff .  the downside to spending so much time with william is that we don't get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible .  we're constantly exposed to william's thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don't actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him .  there are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we're not sure what she's been thinking all the times in between .  this , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant's film hands down .  he gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance .  julia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress's top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character's unpredictable behavior .  anna doesn't get a lot of our compassion .  this romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast .  most notable is rhys ifans as spike , william's eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh .  hugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william's friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister's birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst .  it's a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation .  roger michell's use of visuals doesn't sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type .  for example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass .  whereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying "" eight months later , "" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william's walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him .  another memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air .  we're generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird's eye view of the ground below .  music is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film's scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect .  it's kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today's lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video .  at least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate .  notting hill's grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it .  for a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that's not so bad , now is it ?

The author praises Hugh Grant's performance, the comedic aspects of the movie, and the use of visuals. However, they mention the lack of involvement and detached performance of Julia Roberts, which may have disappointed her fans. The review also suggests that the movie leans more towards being a comedy than a romance.
1|"ingredients : man with amnesia who wakes up wanted for murder , dark science fiction city controlled by alien beings with mental powers .  synopsis : what if you woke up one day , and suspected you were not on earth , and instead were part of an experiment in a giant space terrarium manipulated by intergalactic alien zookeepers ?  in dark city john murdoch ( rufus sewell ) has this problem .  dark city starts out like a 1940s noir amnesia detective mystery .  poor john wakes up with amnesia in a hotel room with a dead dame in one corner .  a mysterious phone call tells him to get the heck out of there , and soon enough john is chased all over town by a murderous army of pale people in black trench-coats , as well as by the police , and the dogged inspector bumstead ( william hurt ) .  is john a murderer , and what can his missing memories tell him ?  he searches through his own wallet for possible contacts and clues .  but when the clues don't fit , it doesn't just confuse him ; it causes john to go so far as to question the whole nature of reality in the dark city .  to john , something is fishy , and very unreal about this city .  how come it's always dark , and nobody seems to remember what they did this morning ?  and how come nobody seems to remember how to leave the city , or how to get to nearby shell beach ?  every night , around midnight , john notices that the whole city enters a state of suspended animation , and at this time , creepy alien experimenters known as the 'strangers' come out and do nasty things like inject fake memories into people's heads with big hypodermic needles .  the strangers have the ability to 'tune , ' or warp reality using telepathic powers .  turns out , the city is not on earth at all .  and the reason why john doesn't fall victim to the nightly suspended animation , is because he is a human mutation that possesses the same god-like reality-warping abilities as the strangers .  even with the help of scientist dr . daniel schreber , can john take back the dark city ?  opinion : director alex proyas ( he also directed the crow ) mentions this in the dark city press kit : in films , science fiction is always "" used to have big spaceships blow up cities .  i think we're a little tired of that . ""  according to director proyas , probably the most interesting thing about dark city is its layers .  it's designed so that you can watch the film over again , and examine it from the perspective of a main character other than murdoch .  it's a philosophical piece .  cinematic science fiction is basically a thinly disguised shootout between the good humans and the bad aliens ( whether they be klingons , giant bugs , or proponents of the dark side of the force ) .  but science fiction in books reaches beyond the 'shoot-em-up' level and targets the big questions , questions like who are we ?  what is the human condition ?  what is ethical ?  what would a true human being do ?  far from comic book style on the order of spawn , batman , or the mutant ninja turtles , dark city not only features the showdown between good humans and powerful aliens , but it also asks questions worthy of films such as brazil or blade runner .  dark city is what philosophers would call an existentialist screenplay .  a little more than 200 years ago , the world was filled with unhappy peasants - - unhappy because nearly every aspect of their lives was controlled by totalitarian , military , conformist , medieval regimes .  the people took refuge in religion , the idea being that earthly life was a time of suffering , but after death , heaven would be available .  meanwhile , the state used these same ideas to prop up their regimes ; the king was often head of the religion and therefore sanctioned by heaven .  when science finally overturned religion , the medieval dictatorships came tumbling down and were replaced by democratic governments .  but the new fear was that the power of science and experimentation would be used to create a world order as darkly totalitarian as the old .  this is the time period when writers and philosophers such as freud , kant , kafka , nietzsche , and dostoevsky pondered what society should be , and what place the individual had in it .  the existentialists' in particular wrote about the power of the lone individual against what may be a hostile , indifferent , or alienated universe .  in dark city , when the last dying , defeated alien asks john murdoch why the aliens' scientific experiments on the human beings' brains failed , murdoch replies , pointing to his head , "" because the human condition isn't located in here .

While there is some negativity in the mention of murder and dark elements, the overall sentiment is slightly positive due to the thought-provoking ideas and the director's intention in creating a layered and philosophical movie experience."
