1|let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film , i really wasn't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films .  i'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever-present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years .  i'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film .  by that point , it was evident that mr . bond was back with a vengeance .  all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film weren't exactly a pleasant experience .  it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts .  it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in .  i guess they can be excused though , taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain .  anyway , after somebody remembered what the light switch was for , i settled in for bond .  i think the most noticeable aspect of this , the 19th film in the series , is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films .  there were probably more one-liners in this movie than in the last several combined .  and bond's last one-liner in the film is about the best of the series .  the world is not enough also contained perhaps the most action of any movie of the series .  everything from wild boat chases to the usual assortment of cool bond gadgets trotted out just when there seems to be no way out for 007 .  for the most part , the action sequences worked very well .  although , there were a couple of times that i thought some things were a bit over the top , even for a bond film .  i think some of the blame can be laid at the feet of director michael apted .  while he did a good job for the most part , there were points in the movie , specifically during action sequences , that he seemed to loose site of the fact that he was making essentially an action film .  most noticeably sequences on a snow covered mountain and one involving bond getting through a closing door looked like apted thought he was filming some sort of high brow art movie .  he almost seemed like he didn't know what he was doing .  but they were brief scenes and really shouldn't take away from the otherwise solid job that apted did in directing .  if you have ever seen a bond film , you won't be shocked to learn that plot has never been their strong suit .  the world is not enough is no exception .  this time we have yet another over villain that bond has to stop for the good of the world .  007 matches wits with the terrorist renard ( robert carlyle ) , a man who has a bullet lodged in his brain that makes him impervious to pain .  why this point is included is beyond me .  they took great pains to explain his condition , but it only came up later in the movie as a scene that can only be described as looking like an afterthought .  anyway , renard , like the typical terrorist that he is , is bent on some harebrained scheme involving a mid-east oil pipeline .  i guess world domination just isn't as attractive to terrorists as a money making venture anymore .  bond is brought in to protect the pipeline's owner , elektra king ( sophie marceau ) , who is the daughter of one of renard's recent victims .  along the way , bond has to enlist the help of a nuclear scientist , dr . christmas jones ( denise richards ) , and his old rival valentin zukovsky ( robert carlyle ) .  like all bond films , you basically just have to suspend disbelief over the plot , since it is ridiculous beyond words .  my biggest complaint would be that it was about the most disjointed of any of the bond films .  there was at least one point that i had to stop and try to remember why bond was where he was and why he was doing what he was doing .  the buddy that i saw the movie with was completely confused over an earlier kidnapping of marceau's character .  it was alluded to earlier in the movie briefly -- although not included in the film .  later , it became a big part of the story and left him with the distinct feeling that he had missed something .  but because it is a bond film , the beautiful women and nifty gadgets seem to make you forget about script problems quite quickly .  after all , it isn't shakespeare .  how about the cast ?  brosnan seems to get better with each of his appearances as 007 .  i grew up with the roger moore version of bond , so i really enjoyed the lighter style that brosnan brings to the character .  judi dench , as m , had a bigger role in this film than in her two previous appearances in the role .  she brought the talent with her that one would expect from an oscar winner .  robbie coltrane was easily one of the best parts in goldeneye , so it was nice to see his russian mobster character revived in this movie .  coltrane gets more screen time , which simply leads to him stealing even more scenes .  then there are the bond girls .  sophie marceau might be one of the most beautiful actresses working today .  there is just something about her breathtaking eyes that makes her a natural to play the innocent victim .  those that saw her in braveheart know she is more than just a pretty face .  marceau may be the most talented actress to ever play a bond love interest .  then we have denise richards .  there was no doubt in my mind that she was cast exclusively for her looks .  and after you see the outfits she wears , you won't have any trouble guessing what part of her anatomy caught the producer's eyes .  i was pleasantly surprised to find that she really did a good job playing a nuclear scientist .  admittedly , there was one point that the audience snickered a bit at one of her technical lines of dialogue , but other than that she stacks up ( no pun intended ) to her bond girl predecessors nicely .  i must say that the biggest disappointment was robert carlyle's character .  while carlyle did a fine job with the material that he had , his character just never worked for me .  the producers tried very hard to add more complexity to his character , but it just never quite got off the ground .  i guess i was hoping for a bit more regarding the whole impervious to pain aspect of his character , but the writers decided to play up the emotional side of his character .  this might have worked well in another movie , but i don't go to see bond movies for their deep characterizations .  last , but not least , we have desmond llewelyn as q . this is the 17th appearance for llewelyn as bond's gadget guy , and he is as good as ever .  although his screen time has grown far more limited in the past few films , he is still a treat to watch .  rumors abound that this may be his last appearance in the role .  he says future appearances are up to a higher power .  the producers have introduced his protege and future replacement , a bumbling and somewhat pompous character played by comedy master john cleese .  while we don't see much of him in this film , i think it is fair to say that desmond llewelyn's legacy , whenever it is passed on , will be in very capable hands .  so how does it stack up ?  despite some problems , the world is not enough is a very entertaining movie .  and , all things considered , what problems it does have are small compared to some that have plagued earlier bond movies .  this is easily the best of the brosnan films .  it may even be the best of the entire series , certainly in the top 3 .  one thing is for sure , even after 19 movies , there is still plenty of life left in the james bond series .  here's looking forward to bond number 20 .  |0.31993333333333335|0.23333333333333336|0.7966666666666665|The reviewers initially express some doubts about the new Bond film, but those doubts are quickly erased and they find the film to be highly entertaining and enjoyable.

1|"seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p . m . at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic's pass .  [theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture]  modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes .  the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it .   "" your friends and neighbors "" takes a different approach as it's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends .  one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story .  firstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras .  everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative .  but to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult .  labute's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll .  for the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic .  another interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus .  we're always able to tell where the characters are ( someone's home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown .  the film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater .  no one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background .  we're simply dropped in on the characters' lives and are expected to figure out the rest .  the characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they're only concern right now seems to be their sex lives .  first there's barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don't know what they're problem is .  barry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn't have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else .  mary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn't hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something .  labute's script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two .  obviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow .  another couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything .  their sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship .  if only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area .  it's natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ?  what did they ever see in the other person to begin with ?  labute never really answers , but since the film is more concerned with the payoff than the process , it still makes for good drama , tension , and manip ulation so intricate and deceitful it's fascinating .  two other characters act as catalysts , cary ( jason patric ) and cheri ( natassja kinski ) .  cary is an arrogant , hostile sex-maniac who defines the word "" bastard . ""  somehow he is able to bend women to his will , either through charm or just attitude , into getting his way .  he's the kind of guy everyone should stay away from as we realize he's secretly perverted , but somehow barry finds comfort in his company , although jerry is always nervous around him .  patric gives an outstanding performance , so much so that we want to know more about him despite how intimidating and unlikable he is .  cheri is a character labute uses as a catalyst to see how the other characters react to her .  she works in an art museum and at some point throughout the film , each character will engage her in almost the exact same conversation and her reaction is always different , from becoming involved in a relationship with one , to brushing it off as small talk with another , to being outright appalled by yet another .  she's a sweet woman , perhaps the most normal of any of the characters , and although her symbolism is obvious , her role as the outsider is the most relatable .  i will not reveal who cheats on who and how each character is specifically affected by the others' action , as that's the hook of the film .  the first two acts begin to set up the characters and each's scenarios , but it's often difficult to tell what they will do about it and with whom .  the result is sometimes surprising , other times predictable , but the actual course of actions is always fascinating .  for a while everyone has their fun , but ultimately each character's guilt , attitude , or ignorance will disserve them .  one of the most important things to note is how realistic the story is supposed to be .  since the characters only interact with each other there isn't much pop culture references , as almost everything has a deeper philosophy behind it .  are we to assume that these people are , as the title states , our friends and neighbors ?  i don't know of anyone going through the same situations as these people .  often times the film is not unlike a network melodrama , other times situations are like those not seen outside a porno movie .  but what this film does have that the others don't is repercussions in the end .  although the film creates its own reality , it goes to show that even the immoral aren't immortal .  in what way "" your friends and neighbors "" is supposed to work is open to interpretation .  it definitely has a lot to say about the price that comes with infidelity , but it could have been even better had it expanded on that theme more specifically .  still , it's an accomplishment in film-making because it has put a timeless theme into a modern perspective .

1|"the characters in "" palmetto "" collectively sweat enough to fill lake erie , and it's just the right way to capture the film's ripe atmosphere of sensuality , tension and even farce .  this humid florida-set thriller nurtures a modestly absurd edginess that often winks at itself , which is very much a good thing since the actors and director are in on the joke .  as far as set-up is concerned , the movie is nothing we haven't seen before , but be patient -- "" palmetto "" spins some pretty wicked story twists that we really don't see coming .  it's not a classic by any means , but it sure is quite an engaging surprise .  harry barber ( woody harrelson ) is fresh out of prison , where he's served a couple of years for a crime he didn't commit .  even though he harbors animosity towards the obtuse local officials , harry's first order of business is to return to his home town of palmetto to be with his sculptor girlfriend nina ( gina gershon ) .  while searching for work , he catches the eye of rhea malroux ( elisabeth shue ) , the mysterious sexbomb wife of a palmetto millionaire .  rhea proposes a scheme that'll get harry $50 , 000 easy -- to play a small part in the staged kidnaping of her jailbait stepdaughter odette ( chloe sevigny ) .   "" you do like risks , don't you , mr . barber ? ""  rhea alluringly coos .  boys , form a line behind me .  part of "" palmetto "" 's success can be attributed to the performance of elisabeth shue , who demonstrates here that her oscar-nominated turn in "" leaving las vegas "" might merely be foreshadowing great things to come .  shue's a seductive , campy delight , and pulls off a barbara stanwyck-gloria swanson combo with admirable relish .  the other actors form a solid ensemble around her , including sevigny ( "" kids "" ) , tantalizingly slutty as a teen tease , as well as the ever-likeable gershon , cast a far cry from her extreme roles in "" bound "" and "" showgirls . ""  harrelson is still doing fine follow-up work to "" the people vs . larry flynt . ""   "" palmetto "" does have its share of grievances .  harrelson's narration is needless , i suppose , and gershon's nina cries to be meatier than she ultimately is .  one of the plot's unexpected angles -- that harry is asked by the police to become the press liaison for the very crime in which he's involved -- could have been played a little better .  there are moments when you question the tone , but it's never so unstable that it deserves the reproach it's been receiving from most other critics .  if "" palmetto "" didn't want to be laughed at , would it really have tacked on a climax that plays like a live-action "" who framed roger rabbit "" ?  although a few elements can be questioned , the movie works well on its own terms .  thanks to a juicy cast -- especially shue -- and the nifty material approach from director volker schlondorff ( you remember him from last summer's suddenly re-popular "" the tin drum , "" right ? ) ,  everything runs smoothly .  and for fans of revelation-heavy endings , this film's got a few shocks in store that i won't even dream of revealing .

1|"with the sudden liberal emergence of personal privacy abounding in the news lately , what with that whole clinton thing going on ( you know , 100 million bucks to discover the president got boinked by an intern - oh , please , government , waste my taxes just a bit more , would you ? ) ,  it's about time tony scott helmed the newest action pic disguised as an important if not slightly ignorant social statement .  with this and "" crimson tide , "" he's created two successfully chilly films that are interesting , exciting , even pretty smart , but never totally riveting as cinema , and the problem i think with each of these films is that each film is too obsessed with its message to ever be really satisfying , and too obsessed with looking all cutting edge to ever be totally smart .  that film dealt with a civil war inside a nuclear submarine over whether or not to follow rules or question them , and was appropriately scary and all , but never totally thrilling or overly brilliant .   "" enemy of the state "" is the same way : it's engrossing for its entire running time , and it's scary the way that it shows a man's decent into kafkaism , but it's too technical .  it's too cold and not as fascinating or exciting as it could be .  it casts will smith , one of the better big budget leading men in movies these days because he's charming and witty and never uninteresting , and hopes that his charisma can make up for his character not being well developed enough to really be a person .  i hate to do this , but last year's film "" the game "" got it damn perfect : it casts michael douglas as a deeply flawed human being , a man who is cold and has cut off everyone from his life , and then pulls everything he thought he had as a security blanket away from him and watched what happened .  the result was not only a film that was exciting and chilling , but also the best mindfuck of the entire year .  not that i want every kafkaesque film to be "" the game "" ( this year's "" the spanish prisoner "" succeeds with less thrills and chills ) , but it should be an example of what works and what doesn't .  will smith's character is , frankly , too perfect , at least too movie perfect .  he had an affair with another woman ( lisa bonet , ha ha ) , but his relationship with his wife ( regina king ) is basically fine regardless .  he has a kid , and he's raking in money as a lawyer , albeit a very good and reasonably moral one .  so he generally doesn't have any real problems as a human being , and is therefore boring . . . except that he is played by will smith , who embodies him with about as much will smith charm as he can without entering "" id4 "" / "" men in black "" territory .  he's a good dramatic actor ( just see the first half hour of "" six degrees of separation "" for proof of this , not that he isn't great the whole time ) , and here , he makes his character likable and sympathetic without any real strain on his character , which makes the film lack any real deep interesting qualities .  smith becomes involved in a mass conspiracy involving the assasination of a senator opposed to a government law that would create world surveillance , extinguishing privacy as we know it from the world , under the pretense that it would make crime easier to control , when he is passed a disk of the event caught on tape by an outside party ( a nature observer played by , uh , jason lee ) .  the government wants the disk , and is prepared to destroy his life to get it .  as smith's plight is dramatized , we are introduced to the masterminds who surveillance him , sitting in vans disguised as other businesses , staring at computers and pulling out tricks faster than a speeding bullet .  these guys ( played by jack black , jamie kennedy , and seth green ) are the most interesting part of this film because they're , well , fascinating : they're doing their jobs , which are evil , but the film doesn't view them as such , and they almost become our friends .  we like these guys for the sole reason that the film doesn't automatically judge them as the villains .  they're also scary because we get the idea that they're not fully aware of the impact their jobs have on the world .  it's as if they're obsessed with their jobs , not because they're evil , but because , hey , it's a fun job , and no one else can do it like them .  unfortunately , this also backfires a bit on the film : instead of being the flashlight in the darkened room that "" the game "" was , you see everything , and are thus not as freaked out because you know what is going on .  sure , you're chilled , but you're not exacty freaked out by what's going on .  but what do you expect from tony scott , the man who never met a five-second piece of film he ever liked .  he's a not-bad director because , hell , he is always interesting to watch ( if not occasionally moronic - exhibit a : "" days of thunder "" ) , but the reason he's not great is because he's too technical and calculated .  his shots are perfectly executed , and leave nothing to the imagination , and they're always making sure you're paying attention .  this is incredibly annoying , and it reduces "" enemy of the state "" to a mechanical mishmash of flashy images that never expand the mind at any great depths , but still manage to entertain without any real problems .  despite never actually becoming great , it's never actually boring and it's always intriguing .  watching the government set-up smith is endlessly fascinating , and since we care about smith's likeable protagonist , we are set-up for a good two hours worth of tom clancy-esque entertainment .  add the best big cast this side of the annual woody allen film ( everyone from gabriel byrne to dan butler pop up for cameos ) , and you've got a good old fashioned escapist drama which does all the thinking for you so that you never have to actually question the debate over personal privacy and so you can follow will smith's plight without a minute's worth of boredom .

"" shanghai noon "" is just good fun .  the chemistry between the cast is remarkable .  the performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film .  jackie's performance is as good as anything he's done before .  he's not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth .  but jackie's natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on .  owen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of "" the haunting "" , gives a good natured performance as roy o'bannon .  his innocence is refreshing and fun .  a bad guy that's not really bad .  his scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and lewis .  lucy liu as princess pei pei is given little to do in the script , but for a change does not play a nymphet or some other deviant .  the character is a noble woman of status and wealth , but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment .  the rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances .  nothing here is realistic , mind you .   "" shanghai noon "" is first and foremost a light , jovial film .  and the performances match that style with ease .  the cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous .  using calgary , alberta as the prime location .  mr . mindel is able to create a lush , romantic western feel to the film .  nothing here really looks like nevada , but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged , the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre .  and as such , the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films .  homage to such films as "" high noon "" ( obviously ) , "" red river "" and most notably "" butch cassidy & the sundance kid "" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film .  it is a comforting experience .  at a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant , here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and ( dare i say ) clich ? s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing .  here is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre .  this is the purest "" horse opera "" since the days of george o'brian or john wayne .  director tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood's past .  in this , his first film mr . dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see .  nothing here really stands out , or takes one's attention away from the story or action .  and that is as it should be , when jackie chan is your star .  and what of the action and stunts .  well , while not up to a level of "" drunken master 2 "" or any of jackie's hong kong films , "" shanghai noon "" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before .  his timing , choreography , and creativity are still as sharp as ever .  jackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films ( obvious to those of us that have seen those films , but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar ) .  finally jackie can honestly say , that he has made an u . s . , his way and incorporating his style .  to sum up , "" shanghai noon "" is a fun summer confection .  not too heavy and not too light .  a fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy ( parents be advised there are scenes of smoking , drunkenness and peyote use ) .  an enjoyable and charming film that can and will be enjoyed again and again .

1|"the reunion film is not an original idea in any way , shape , or form .  it's been done throughout film history over and over again , and has become one of the many sub-genres , like the prep school sub-genre , the angst-filled teen sub-genre , and the slasher sub-genre .  what makes "" peter's friends "" so remarkable is not how it doesn't follow the rules of this sub-genre , but how it follows it so well , and creates characters that i wouldn't mind hanging with .  what are the rules of the reunion sub-genre ?  well . . . .  1 . you need a group of friends , most of them married or at least dating , and sometimes even married or dating eachother .  2 . you need to have them brought back together over some sort of a crisis .  3 . they are not to have spoken together much since they split apart .  4 . the reunion has to come in intervals divisible by 10 .  5 . they all have to be slightly to highly neurotic .  6 . the reunion has to bring them together , seperate them with little crises , then bring them back together because , after all , they're friends .  7 . there has to be some sex or at least some making out either between the friends or with other people that are there or were invited .  8 . eightly , they're all unhappy or marginally so .  9 . there's some sort of sexual tension amongst some of them that's built up over the years .  10 . the friends are all wildly successful in the world of entertainment and the arts , sometimes internationally so .  11 . the film is filled with nostalgic radio hits from the time when they were friends , sometimes causing them to get together in dance/song .  since it follows these rules so closely , it will probably be ( and has been ) coined off as just a "" british 'big chill . ' ""  and in some ways it is .  both follow the rules , as i said , and both feature lots of bitching , big confessionals , and broken relationships .  but while "" the big chill "" was , at least to me , a tad too whiny and unsatisfying , "" peter's friends "" hits its mark , making this film funny , dramatic , and poignant .  the friends of peter's were all in the same theatre group back in '82 , performig wildly outrageous british acts for people far too stuck up to enjoy them ( the opening scene has them all dancing in tux tops and tutus ) .  after peter's ( stephen fry ) wealthy father ( richard briers , hardly on screen enough to register , but oh well ) dies , leaving a giant mansion to him , he has to decide whether or not to keep it .  not sure what to do with it immeadiately , he decides to throw a giant reunion party , inviting back all his old chums .  of course , all or most of his chums follow the tenth rule .  andrew ( kenneth branagh , also directing here ) is an actor who's unhappily married to a tv star , carol ( co-writer rita rudner ) .  maggie ( emma thompson ) is a successfuly publisher of self-help books , but looks like she needs them more than her customers , as she is lonely and unhappy .  roger and mary ( hugh laurie and imelda staunton , who were also married in "" sense and sensibility "" ) are married , and are the most successful creators of jingles in the uk , but have suffered a tragedy as one of their newly born twins has recently died .  and sarah ( alphonsia emmanuel ) is as promiscuous as ever , having a new boyfriend as of two weeks named brian ( tony slattery ) who's married and wants a divorce because of her , giving her doubts .  as for peter , things seem okay . . .  the film features lots of inner-friend jokes , and even some old theatre anecdotes ( which i at least find a lot of fun in , as i've done lots of theatre myself ) .  and there are big confessions , brawls between the friends , and by the end , almost everyone is unhappy , even though some have resolved their problems long before the end ( which i kinda dug ) .  the final twist would seem forced an anti-climactic , but for some reason , i felt the same way the rest of the friends did .  maybe it's because the people in this film are so likable that i just wanted to join their clique .  that's really what makes "" peter's friends "" so lovable : the way you just want to hang with a group of friends who can be so dysfuntional sometimes , but when someone's in crisis , can come together wonderfully for one another .  it's when you have a giant crisis like this and people want to selflessly help you out instead of subtely pushing you away that makes you realize you have true friends , and these people are true friends .  not to mention kenneth branagh is able to make the film seem nostalgic for the 80s ( a decade i grew up in , unfortunately ) without taking us outside of the 90s .  there are some 80s classics and anti-classics like tears for fears "" everybody wants to rule the world , "" but unfortunately no stupid/fun 80s songs ( i think if i ever did an 80s reunion film , i'd put some crap go gos song on , or at least some good old "" come on eileen "" ) , but this is the british 80s we're talking about .  oh well .  but anyway , the direction is pretty good , although nothing amazing .  branagh's forte is really making shakespeare fresh and magical , but at least he's very good with making a less ambiguous film like this .  the writing is good from rita rudner and martin bregman , with lots of good one-liners , and even some really bad but good puns ( to mock the fact that andrew lives in l . a . , peter , while cutting some logs , asks him is he has wood in l . a . , and andrew says , "" no , but we have hollywood "" - punishment like that ) .  the actors , as in most speaking movies , are better than their material , though , with some stand-out performances to the six friends , as well as the outsiders like slattery , rudner , and phyllida law as the old housekeeper of the peter's mansion .  a little note should be made about hugh laurie's performance , as he looks like he took some massive doses of prozac before doing this - i mean , i've never seen him actually act this dramatically .   "" peter's friends "" is a really enjoyable film which makes people like me pine for some sort of future reunion , although i don't know what kind i'll have ( like most people , i don't look forward to my high school reunion ) .  because of the way these friends are still able to maintain the same amount of care they have for one another and after such a long period of seperation , i just look forward to the day when i can have friends like that .

1|"once upon a time a solitary ogre named shrek ( mike myers ) was really annoyed to discover that his swamp had been invaded by three blind mice , seven dwarves and all the other fairy tale characters in the land , banished from their home by lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) .  unwittingly befriended by a non-stop talking donkey ( eddie murphy ) , shrek travels to dulloc to speak with farquaad , where he stumbles into a joust and comes up the winner .  his prize ?  to save princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) from a tower surrounded by molten flame and protected by a dragon so she can become farquaad's bride .  the ogre agrees to the task in return for getting his solitary lifestyle back in "" shrek . ""  it took four writers ( ted elliott and terry rossio ( "" the road to el dorado "" ) , roger s . h .  schulman ( "" balto "" ) and joe stillman ( "" beavis and butthead do america "" ) ) to adapt william steig's children's book .  the bad news ?  they've genericized an already simple plotline while heavily under the influence of william goldman's "" the princess bride . ""  the good news ?  there's so much wacky humor culled from both fairy tales and popular culture that this movie should keep you in stitches .  we get our first inkling that we're in for a real treat as one of farquaad's men , intent on rounding up magical creatures offers 'five schillings for the possessed boy ! ' after observing dreamworks' rendition of disney's animated pinocchio .  meanwhile within the castle walls , a gingerbread man being tortured  by farquaad spits icing and yells 'eat me ! '  before breaking down and solemnly asking 'do you know the muffin man ? '  shrek , a green giant with bobbly antennae-like ears , is a grumpy recluse who really yearns to fit in ( although who could put up with his habit of making candles from his own ear wax ? ) .  donkey is a hyperactive , endearingly stunted creature who can talk and , therefore , believes will make a great misfit pairing with the uncooperative shrek .  donkey proves his worth sweet talking the princess-guarding dragon .  the princess proves to be more than a shade offbeat after learning she's not getting the fairy tale issue rescue she's been expecting .  when fiona's true colors are exposed ( including opportunies for some tomboyish gross out humor ) , a spark develops between her and shrek .  the script's details are gleefully impish , constantly poking fun at disney from the theme park world of farquaad's dulloc with its turnstyle entrance and 'it's a small world' parody of an information booth to the blue bird which meets a most un-disneyish fate after duetting with fiona 'snow white' style .  popular culture is represented with film references to "" babe "" and "" charlies' angels "" via "" the matrix . ""  myers chooses his 'so i married an axe murderer' scottish brogue for shrek in order to give his voice some heft .  while this may prove distracting for anyone familiar with that film , overall it works more than not .  eddie murphy steals the show as the fast-talking , motown-singing donkey , proving once again his talent as a vocal performer ( is it another wink at disney that donkey is paired with a dragon , a creature murphy portrayed in disney's 'mulan ? ' ) .  lithgow's a good choice for the supercilious , height-challenged villain lord farquaad .  diaz is energetic but ultimately nondescript voicing princess fiona .   ( a better choice would have been minnie driver , who's proven herself a terrific vocal talent in such diverse animations as disney's "" tarzan , "" "" princess mononoke "" and the "" south park "" movie . )  the computer animation looks terrific ( particularly donkey ) , although it won't elicit the types of oohs and aahs of pixar's work ( "" toy story , "" "" a bug's life , "" "" toy story 2 "" ) .  in keeping with its hip style , pop music is used , which like myer's voice may be initially jarring , but ultimately satisfies ( while surveying bridal candidates via a 'dating game' parody broadcast by snow white's evil queen's mirror , farquaad is told 'fiona likes pina coladas' - cue jimmy buffet ! ) .   "" shrek "" has good lessons for kids and humor targetted at every age group in the family .  while it may be derivative of the 1987's "" the princess bride , "" "" shrek "" addresses a new generation with similar sensibilities and doesn't suffer in the comparison .

1|"some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled , making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen .  i finished mike figgis' "" leaving las vegas "" hours ago , and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr .  alot of people refer to this film as "" that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude "" .   "" leaving las vegas "" is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are : a drunk and a whore .  ben ( nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years ) is the drunk .  his family and friends have long since abandon him , and all he has left is his liquor .  in a scene early in the film , we see ben staggering into a resteraunt , looking for a "" friend "" of his to mooch some money off of .  he finds the guy ( richard lewis ) having dinner with a buddy and two chicks , trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid .  when ben approaches the table , you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable .  after lewis gives ben the money , he coldly says "" i think it would be best if you didn't contact me again . ""  now even though through the course of the film , some much more depressing things happen , this is when i felt the most for ben .  there was such a look of sorrow and dispare on his face , ( not to sound hokey or anything ) it almost brought a tear to my eye .  it turns out that ben was once a semi-successful hollywood player , and apparently a pretty popular guy .  now he spends his time getting robbed by hookers and trying desperatly to pick up women , not so much for the sex , but for the company ; for someone to talk to or spend time with .  once he is fired from his job , ben decides to burn all his belongings , collect all his cash and relocate to las vegas to slowly drink himself to death .  one night he runs into a prostitute ( a brilliant performance by elizabeth shue - how far she has come since "" adventures in babysitting "" ) named sera .  she is involved in an abusive relationship with her pimp , a scumbag who gets-off by cutting her .  they are both very lonely , self-destructive people .  they immediatly hit it off , both of them realizing that they need one another .  and it isn't even a sexual relationship .  they don't even have sex until , like , the last ten minutes of the film .   "" leaving las vegas "" is not a film about plot .  with the exception of what i have already revealed ( which all happens in the first thirty minutes or so , by the way ) , there isn't too much of a story to it .  it is more a film about people and how they react to one another .  from what i can see , this is basically a perfect film .  the direction is great ( with mike figgis doing a brilliant mix between the glamor of las vegas and the moody , smokey atmosphere of a film noir ) and it contains two of the best performances to come out of the 90s , or any other decade for that matter .  but don't go rushing out to see this movie without knowing what you're getting yourself into .  first off , if you are easily offended by frank sexual dialouge , stay away from "" leaving las vegas "" .  it is filled with lengthy discussions of orgasms , rape and various forms of perverted activities involving burbon ( that's right ) .  secondly , if you are not in the mood to see a very depressing film , don't see it .  however , if you are cool with those two things , you are in for one of the most memorable experiences you will ever have .

1|`run lola run' , a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival , is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance .  for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non-stop movement , we follow a fiery-haired heroine named lola ( franka potente ) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers .  lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100 , 000 marks in time to save manni ( moritz bleibtreu ) from being killed by the dealer .  but , in something of a pseudo- `groundhog day' approach , director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal .  in these trio of episodes , we gradually learn the unique effects of fate , for even if tiny changes are made in lola's journey , the future can be seriously altered .  `run lola run' is an experience like `fight club' or `the matrix' , in that each film takes you through a super-charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways .  in addition , all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack .  `lola' is no exception , with stylish quick-flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get-go .  tykwer's world is a landscape of mood and color , with brilliant shades of red and pink ( including lola's fiery hair ) used as effective symbolism throughout .  with it's visual style and mind-blowing pace , `run lola run' is one of the more invigorating movies of the year .  even more so when considering the fact it's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period .  as a heroine , potente does little more than run wildly through the streets ( as the title suggests ) , but she has a certain flair and charisma .  her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star .  meanwhile , bleibtreu does an equally fantastic job of bringing the dopey but passionate manni to life .  both actors perform beyond the call of duty .  the dazzling fun comes from predicting what each episode holds in store for lola , and the outcome is ultimately rewarding - several twists and turns are unique and unexpected .  the other characters lola runs into ( both purposely and inadvertently ) include her banker father ( herbert kraup ) and a friendly security guard ( armin rohde ) , but aside from the two leads , no one has more than a few minutes of screen time .  additional stars that couldn't possibly be ignored are cinematographer frank griebe and editor mathilde bonnefroy , who are both responsible for the film's eye-catching visual elegance .  `run lola run' is subtitled , so be prepared to meet the challenge of reading the lightning-fast dialogue - occasional sections of it are especially fast .  this is only one of the minor chores involved in watching .  the other is the sense that we never get to really recognize who the real people are in this hyperactive situation .  most are just chess pieces in tykwer's elaborate game of visual presentation , and he never really makes a significant move with any .  but , the average viewer is likely to be so absorbed in the action that few will realize the lack of potency in a few elements of the screenplay .  a few petty gripes aside , this film is a wild , exhilarating ride that turns maniacally on its wheel of originality .  most people believe foreign films are mainly boring , talky character studies .  perhaps `run lola run' will recharge their batteries .  not only does this film offer insight into some intriguing questions of fate and destiny , it also delivers a white-knuckle visual rollercoaster ride of overwhelming audacity .  like how the experience must have been for the persistent title character , `run lola run' is exhausting .  |0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|0.9|"""Run Lola Run"" is a dazzling and kinetic film with a unique storytelling approach, captivating visual style, and engaging performances that offer an invigorating and rewarding experience.

1|"in "" the sweet hereafter , "" writer/director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living .  he shows us how it isn't dying that hurts , but rather the pain of living in the hereafter of death , and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings .  on a cold winter day in a small , isolated town in british columbia , a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake , where it cracks through the ice and sinks .  fourteen children die , and numerous others are hurt .  for the residents of this small town , all of whose children were on that bus , it is an earth-shattering event that resolutely alters their lives .  they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain , but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle .  alberta and risa walker , who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident , hire an attorney named mitchell stephens ( ian holm ) to bring a lawsuit against someone , anyone for responsibility .  the bus driver , dolores driscoll ( gabrielle rose ) , is a kindly woman who loved the children and , although she lives with a burden of guilt , is not held responsible for the accident .  the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice , and there was nothing should could do to prevent it .  however , according to stephens , there are no "" accidents "" in life , and someone will pay for this tragedy , whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through .  he goes through the town , approaching the parents who have lost children , asking them to join the class action suit and find vent for their anger .  and , for his work , stephens will receive one-third of the settlement money .  however , it is immediately apparent that stephens has little or no interest in the money .  he is driven by something else , something deeper that he shares in common with the grieving parents .  he has lost a child , too , but not in the same manner .  his daughter , zoe ( caerthan banks ) , who once almost died in his arms as a young child after a spider bite , has been in and out of drug re-hab clinics and detox stations for ten years .  she calls him on an irregular basis , begging him for money , but refusing to tell him what she needs it for .   "" i don't know who i'm taking to , "" he tells her .  in his mind , his daughter is dead .  the lawsuit is , to stephens , not only a way to mend the town's pain , but also his own .  however , not everyone in town wants it to happen .  billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who was driving behind the bus when the accident happened and lost two children , wants nothing to do with it .  he has already lost his wife , and he buries his grief in an affair with a married woman .  he doesn't want to talk about the accident , and he sees the lawsuit as nothing more than the unnecessary opening of old wounds .  to him , the town should be able to take care of its own pain , and it doesn't need outsiders like stephens getting in the way .  central to "" the sweet hereafter "" is the tale of nicole burnell ( sarah polley ) , a teenage girl who dreams of being a singer before the accident turned her into "" a wheelchair girl , "" as she puts it .  aside from stephens , nicole is the most complex character in the film , and it is she who ultimately decides the fate of the town and how the lawsuit will turn out .  it is also her sad , haunted voice that we often hear on the soundtrack , reading robert browning's poem about the pied piper , and how when he led all the town's children away , one was left behind because he was crippled .  obviously , nicole is that child , and she feels somehow betrayed that the rest of the town's children left her alone by dying in the wreck .  her situation is further complicated because she is involved in a loving , but incestuous relationship with her father ( tom mccamus ) .  there is only one , fleeting scene that suggests this relationship , but it is somehow tied into the final act of the film .  of all the storylines in "" the sweet hereafter , "" this is the most complicated and unresolved , although its implications stretch throughout the entirety of the film .  egoyan knows that the kinds of questions he brings up have no simple answers -- if any at all -- and he doesn't condescend to the audience by trying to neatly wrap it up .  what egoyan has done in "" the sweet hereafter "" is really nothing short of miraculous .  in his adaptation of the novel by russell banks , he has made a deeply moving film about a lawyer by transcending the pettiness of law and driving headlong into the deeper meaning of what is loss , and how pitiful monetary and material possessions are when compared to human life .  egoyan has always been a talented , but distant and cerebral filmmaker whose work suffered only in that it felt so cold .   "" the sweet hereafter "" is quite the opposite ; egoyan's stylistic and narrative structures work brilliantly to heighten the impact of the natural emotion , and draw the audience into the tragedy .   "" the sweet hereafter "" seems to contain the combined emotional impact that all his other films lacked .  the film is filled with beautiful , subtle performances from all the actors , especially ian holm as the lawyer and sarah polley as the sad child who was left behind .  the beautiful , roving camerawork by paul sarossy and the haunting , melodic musical score by mychael danna ( both previous egoyan collaborators ) give the film a visual and aural cohesiveness with the thematic elements .  like his earlier films , egoyan weaves together multiple storylines that form a blanketing whole .  he works with time as a fluid substance , shifting back and forth between the past , the distant past , and the present with effortless ease .  the actual bus wreck itself doesn't happen until midway through the film , but by that time the event has built up so much emotion that egoyan can film it from a distance with no graphic detail , and still have it carry great , devastating weight .  because human life has become such a cheap commodity in movies , it is astounding that egoyan can convey so much heartbreak in such simple , direct terms .  certainly one of the best films of 1997 , "" the sweet hereafter "" is a deeply rewarding , mystifying , and ultimately human film .

1|"when i first heard about scream in 1996 , i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies .  from the master of the horror himself , wes craven , it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them , by making the teenagers do what they know they're not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them ( don't run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door , never say "" i'll be right back , "" etc . ) .  when i first heard this description , i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie .  how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies .  was this wes craven's remedy from making "" real "" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn ?  it just seemed cheap to me .  then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes , involving drew barrymore and a nail-bitingly intense phone conversation , completely changed my attitude .  scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick , it's also a pretty scary movie .  if you've seen a million of these kinds of films , you know exactly what is going to happen .  this is part of the fun of watching scream .  the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent , attractive teenagers .  to those who rarely see these types of movies , scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film .  there's nothing wrong with that misjudgment though .  i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience , the newbies to horror and the fanatics .  their opinions on the film were so different but both very positive .  from these varied reviews , i am convinced that scream has not only revived the teen horror movie and the normal teen romance movies but also the hilarious parodies of these and other categories .  films that both deride and celebrate genres like galaxy quest and the big hit would not have existed , in my opinion , if it was not for the outstanding success of scream .  the low - budget 1996 gem may , alongside pulp fiction , be the most influential film of the 1990's .  this influence may exist to the chagrin of some moviegoers who despise movies like teaching mrs . tingle or television programs such as dawson's creek but to others such as myself , we congratulate the movie that has opened new doors for excellent young actors , screenwriters , and directors .  scream is also an extremely funny movie thanks to its quickly-paced script by kevin williamson .  within the film are characters who tell other characters , as well as the audience , the basic rules and cliches of a horror movie .  mainly from the rants of randy ( jamie kennedy ) and stu ( matthew lillard ) , we are reminded not only of the obvious and hilarious rules but also some of the more subtle stereotypes that when thought over are mostly true as well ( the virgin always survives ; have sex and you're dead meat ) .  not only are we treated these rules on a plate but also the rules are referenced to a number of different films and actors .  the script feels like an obsessive essay from a college film geek who has nothing better to do but find every little blunder from every little film for his own self-satisfaction .  in this case , williamson finds these errors for the audience's satisfaction and amusement .  i hear there is a new movie coming out called scary movie which is a spoof of scream , which is a spoof of scary movies .  i will certainly see the film but i have the feeling that this parody will be more obviously ridiculing the genre rather than scream's perfect subtlety .  however my last gut feeling about this stuff , scream , was dead wrong . . .  so who knows .

1|"bob the happy bastard's quickie review :  i must admit , no doubt's single "" new "" is quite catchy .  it was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon , the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back .  the result ?  a movie that's just as good as that song , really .  it follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend .  first we hear about a grocery bagger ( sara polley ) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave ( with bad results , as a drug dealer feels he's been swindled by her ) ; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker ( same store ) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends , where sex , gunplay , and stolen car trouble come into play ; then we see the story of two gay movie actors ( played by scott wolf and jay mohr ) who deal with a cop's strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl ( sara ) with their car ; and , finally , we come to another grocery worker ( katie holmes ) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer ( the one mentioned earlier ) .  really , it's all confusing to keep track of in review format , your best bet is to just , well , go .  the movie features some very good acting from all angles , and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product .  the dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized , not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending .  think of it as a , well , ending .  the intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie , as it's never really confusing and tells different sides of the story , like sliding doors kinda did .  however , it's better suited for the younger generation who want a little spice in their flicks , which sliding doors kinda isn't .

1|"while watching "" shallow grave , "" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens' "" blood simple . ""  both are good films in which several characters , none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil , indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes .  the body count rises , and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands .  both films are also flawed , but for different reasons .   "" blood simple "" is unrelentingly dark and moody , but its characterizations were a little hollow .   "" shallow grave , "" on the other hand , is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes , and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they'd accomplished for a more standard , audience-pleasing ending .  the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time , yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end .  as the film begins , we are introduced to alex ( ewan mcgregor ) , juliet ( kerry fox ) , and david ( christopher eccleston ) , a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow .  they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious , but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch .  a man named hugo moves into the apartment's remaining vacancy , and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose .  juliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash ( presumably from criminal activities ) .  the three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death ; after a drawing of straws , the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david , who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning .  all of this transpires in the first twenty minutes or so of the film , and part of what makes "" shallow grave "" so brilliant for a while is that i honestly had no idea what was coming next .  other than the obvious question of why they don't report the death and simply hide the cash , which is not addressed , the plotting and characterization , while sometimes predictable , worked in a way that kept my attention and , on more than one occasion , gave me chills .  i will , therefore , attempt to continue this review in a way that doesn't give away too much of the plot .  broadly , the trio are in danger due to hugo's underworld connections , as two goons search for the money and kill several people in the process .  a police inspector ( ken stott ) is clearly suspicious and visits the apartment , asking pointed questions and trying to unnerve the three suspects by exchanging banal and weirdly humorous bits of dialogue with a junior detective .  david , meanwhile , becomes increasingly paranoid , moves into the attic , and develops an affinity for sharp objects .  director danny boyle effectively creates an atmosphere of mounting tension and suspicion in the apartment , and finally the three seem ready to turn against each other .  while i do not consider myself the "" happy endings are automatically stupid "" type , i thought that "" shallow grave "" really should have ended in tragedy - a realistic analysis of the story up to the last ten minutes of the film would indicate that all three characters were probably about to end up in prison , in the mental hospital , or in the morgue .  this could have been accomplished , quite credibly , but then boyle and screenwriter john hodge seem to flinch and opt for a more conventional "" caper "" ending in which we get a kick out of seeing who outsmarted whom , and nothing more .  granted , this isn't really a "" happy "" ending , but it's still pretty light-hearted compared to what preceded it .  i really shouldn't say anything more about the ending as far as details go , but let me add that it seemed not only shallow and lazy but also inconsistent with the rest of the film and not very believable .  yes , this ending made me crack a smile for a couple of minutes , but ultimately it left me feeling as if i'd been cheated .  still , "" shallow grave "" was brilliant most of the way through , and it does at least meet the minimum requirements for an entertaining thriller , and i am therefore awarding it three stars .  i guess i just can't help but think about that fourth star that boyle and hodge let slip away .

1|"since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they're portraying , it's fitting to say that "" beloved "" come as a real shock as a film .  it's confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i've seen all year , and that's not necessarily because of the three-hour running time .   "" beloved "" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , "" beloved "" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) .   "" beloved "" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children .  when the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family .  sethe is proud , though , and will not move .  her sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation .  a couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging .  he has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot .  when he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies "" it ain't evil .  it's just sad . ""  some more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears .  but when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house .  her name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills .  she stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk .  they let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down .   "" beloved "" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story .  most of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts .  sethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , "" they took my milk ! ""  worst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back .  she runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don't leave them alone .  when she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn't regret it .  she killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing .  of course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren't flat out told that until later on in the film .  beloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long .  thus , "" beloved "" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , "" solaris , "" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system .  that film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely .   "" beloved "" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable .  the most interesting films are the ones that don't explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense .  sethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she's being played by oprah winfrey .  it's been well over a decade since her last major performance in "" the color purple , "" but judging from these two films , i'll bet she's one of the best actresses working today . . . if  she was strictly an actress .  her talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that's a shame because she brings so much to this movie .  emotion .  sadness .  strength .  watching the strong sethe , who's so afraid of the past that she's built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great .  she makes it real .  that's not to say this is a perfect film .  in fact , i'd wager to say that the fact that it's confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is .  while oprah's performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i'm dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn't show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film .  it doesn't necessarily move as though they're memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore .  but despite its tediousness , perhaps that's the point .  the distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality .  and for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be .  jonathan demme's direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters .  there's more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism .  the acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination .  everyone has been raving about thandie newton's performance , and how it should be rewarded .  however , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part .  act like a baby .  throw things .  stumble around .  chew food with your mouth open .  i do think there's another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it's kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother's loss of reality towards the end .  it's not that newton isn't great : she's as annoying and wacky as the role demands .  it's just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better .  despite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , "" beloved "" has still not done well .  costing , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two .  unfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic "" caligula , "" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) .  although i respect "" beloved , "" i can't say that i really enjoyed it .

1|"with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up , loading their guns , kissing each other and uttering what sounds like "" rock and roll ! ""   ( actually , it's "" lock and load "" ) , you can't help thinking tarantino .  and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery , the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie & clyde to natural born killers .  but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction , exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run , normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon .   "" inspired by true events "" -- we've heard that one before , and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated . . .  or so strangely poignant .  for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality , who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged .  beginning with their final arrest , the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris ( luke perry ) , a policeman , and pam ( ashley judd ) , a factory worker .  they fall in love and marry , but pam's increasingly erratic behaviour ( going on spending sprees , slashing herself with a knife after an argument ) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris .  when chris gets sacked , they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up .  then , chris begins to rob banks . . .  luke perry accomplishes the not-inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer .  moustached , with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation , he is perfectly cast as the long-suffering husband .   ( it's another of john mcnaughton's coups of casting-against-type , after transforming robert de niro into nerd and bill murray into gangster in mad dog and glory ) .  but it is the character of pam who commands centrestage , and ashley judd rises to the challenge with great alternating currents of ferocity and tenderness , making pam into a fascinating yet often infuriating person .  if the performance falls short of greatness , however , it is perhaps because the role of the mad woman has been done so often before it is virtually a staple of cinema , whether it's in betty blue , tom & viv or georgia .  as in those movies , there's the danger that the performance seems mannered , a collection of screwy tics and tantrums designed for the oscar presentation piece .  judd doesn't entirely avoid this pitfall , but pam's 'craziness' is best and most movingly presented in counterpoint to the more 'normal' chris .  when pam reacts to her father-in-law's death by showing up at the funeral in rollerblades and blaring headphones , chris' face is the picture of pained restraint .  of course , it's the question of what is 'normal' that is asked in normal life .  mcnaughton constantly offers up the ironies of the aspirations for the average domestic life and its kinship with insanity .  it is the rational chris that loves guns ( "" shooting is about precision , control "" ) and the 'crazy' pam that loves astronomy and yearns for a dog ( who is then called chaos -- "" chaos and you and me . . .  we're a real family "" , she notes wryly ) .  it is chris' methodical mind and his knowledge of police procedure that allows him to be such a successful bank robber ( his well-planned disguise as a bearded , roaring man of terror is another piece of method in madness ) .  in the carpark where he sets out for his first robbery , a huge sign on a shopping mall stands out in the background : "" buy-more "" -- the perfectly respectable consumption-crazy american dream that has driven pam to her extravagant purchases , and both of them into desperate situations .  it's not a perfect film .  some of the dialogue is a touch too banal ( perhaps intentionally ? ) .  the use of the punk hardcore soundtrack in pam's crazed scenes comes rather too close to making emotional disturbance seem glamourous and sexy an image which only detracts from the rest of the film .  indeed , as in mcnaughton's seminal film henry : portrait of a serial killer , it is the avoidance of glamour or sensationalism , the denial of some of the standard thrills of the outlaw film genre , that gives this determinedly unflashy , moving film its great strengths .  mcnaughton has filmed this story with a quiet , coolly 'realistic' method that works far better than any nbk theatrics at unsettling the viewer .  the suburbs , with their miles of white-fenced houses and identikit malls , take on a sense of claustrophobic blankness .  in its very different way , this makes for as haunting a backdrop as the wide open spaces in terence malick's badlands .  while pam shares the yearnings of malick's heroes to escape from ordinary life , chris takes up crime precisely so that they can lead a 'normal life' - their little house on the suburbs is financed by his violent robberies .  but these are dreams defined by , constrained by , and even doomed by , the limitations of the 'normal' , conventional world .  pam's final scene takes place at the edge of the suburbs , where wild bushes grow -- symbolically the frontier , the outer limits of her society , but also quite literally the end of the road , where there is nowhere left to go but to the final tragic denouement .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

1|"it's not often that i laugh so hard at a movie that my head hurts .  but that's just what happened to me at uhf , weird al yankovic's big screen debut .  uhf is a television parody a la airplane , and like airplane , the movie is extraordinarily stupid .  but it's dumb in the best way a movie can be dumb : it's so silly and outrageous it's hilarious .  the movie stars weird al as george newman , a world class nerd with a hyperactive imagination , the type who fantasizes he's indiana jones and who uses hostess twinkies as hot dog buns .  george is basically a loser ; his daydreams and smart-alec attitude perpetually prevent him from holding onto a job for more than two weeks .  but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station .  george revives channel 62 with innovative programming : shows like "" wheel of fish "" and movies like "" conan , the librarian . ""  as the station's ratings rise , it comes into competition with channel 8 , the leading vhf network-affiliate .  as r . j .  fletcher--channel 8's ill-natured , hard-nosed owner--veteran stage and film actor kevin mccarthy is flamboyantly sleazy ; he really hams it up with his snorts , grimaces , and scowls .  uhf satirizes anything and everything to do with television , including game shows , tabloid talk shows , children's shows , dizzy news women , and movies--everything from rambo to close encounters .  the funniest scene , the one that made my head spin , is a commercial for spatulas which has to be seen to be believed .  like most movies in its genre , uhf is hit or miss .  for every gag that works , at least one fizzles .  for instance , weird al's mock video of "" money for nothing "" by dire straits is only mildly amusing and brings the film to a grinding halt ( although it does have some nifty computer animation ) .  but the funniest bits in uhf are so hysterical that we can forgive the ones that fail ; we know another gut wrencher is on the way .  in fact , uhf hits the mark often enough to make it the most effective airplane-type movie since . . .  well , since airplane .  much of the credit goes to weird al's exceptionally inventive script and to the movie's winsome cast .  weird al seems a little stiff at the beginning , but because he's not afraid to look silly , he ultimately has a lot of fun with his character .  the real standout is michael richards as stanley , the dim-witted janitor who becomes the host of his own children's show : "" stanley spadowski's playhouse . ""  stanley's off-beat , mixed-up personality is a big hit with the audience and makes him an over-night star .  he is an endearing mixture of good-natured innocence , high-energy enthusiasm , and puppy-dog cuteness .  and above all , he's a good janitor who adores his work .  another highlight is a vintage cameo by the incomparable emo philips .  the cast also features gedde watanabe ( the chinese foreign-exchange student in sixteen candles ) as the karate master who hosts the hit series , "" wheel of fish . ""  also aboard for the ride is fran drescher , who plays pamela finklestein , channel 62's roving reporter .  unfortunately , as weird al's girlfriend , victoria jackson is wasted in a role that calls for nothing but whimpering , whining , and sulking .  her character is extraneous and should have been either further integrated into the story or cut from the script altogether .  while uhf is not an absolute must-see , it's definitely the ticket if you're looking for a wild and zany , whacked-out comedy .  the movie is good enough to see in the theaters , but it may work even better on television , the very medium at which it pokes fun .

1|"it's hard not to recommend "" the others . ""  the supernatural thriller , written and directed by alejandro amen ? bar ( "" open your eyes "" ) , adroitly establishes and maintains a low-key atmosphere of menace .  the cinematography , by javier aguirresarobe , is as good as i have ever seen and nicole kidman gives another in her growing body of fine performances .  but the pacing of the story moves from deliberate to downright sluggish and the payoff of the tale left me less than satisfied .  overall , the film plays like a very high quality version of any number of old "" twilight zone "" episodes where the characters spend a great deal of time wandering about looking afraid and disoriented , only to learn they are actually a child's toy , a military test subject or a department store dummy .  watching those vintage shows and listening to the players chatter , i always wanted to shout , "" get on with it ! ""  as much as i appreciated the atmosphere and acting in "" the others , "" my reaction was much the same .  set at an island mansion off the coast of england during world war ii , the story focuses on grace ( kidman ) , who tends to her children anne ( alakina mann ) and nicholas ( james bentley ) and worries about her husband , charles ( christopher eccleston ) , a missing serviceman .  anne and nicholas suffer from photosensitivity and grace patrols the estate with the keys to all 50 doors , protecting the little ones from excess light by making sure that only one door is open at a time .  at the beginning of the film , three servants , mrs . mills ( fionnula flanagan ) , young , mute lydia ( elaine cassidy ) , and mr . tuttle ( eric sykes ) , an aging gardener , join the family .  the two that speak seem agreeable enough at first , but it soon becomes apparent that they know something that grace does not .  to make matters worse , the children are upset : nicholas is unusually jittery and anne claims to be seeing ghosts .  grace attempts to blame the troubles on the new arrivals to her home , only to realize that whatever is happening is beyond them .  that's essentially the whole story , with the tension growing until the pivotal moment when everything becomes clear .  earlier , there is an outstanding scene where grace darts outside , only to be enveloped in fold after fold of shimmering fog .  the visuals in the otherworldly sequence , courtesy of aguirresarobe , are simply astounding .  i also enjoyed the presence of religion , a rarity in films dealing with the supernatural .  grace is a christian and answers her children's questions about life and death with the assurance of a devout worshiper .  when mother is away , though , the kids speculate whether her statements are fact or folklore , just as real children do .  but those nice touches fail to enliven a film that is too slow or make up for a lackluster ending .

1|"after indecent proposal and up close and personal , redford was wise to direct himself in a picture at last .  redford may look great on-screen , but over the past few years , he's proven himself a bigger talent behind the camera .  ordinary people is one of the best films of the nineteen-eighties , and it was the first picture he helmed .  while the milagro beanfield war was only occasionally successful at combining magic-realism with . . . um ,  realism , and i've never been much of a fan of a river runs through it ( to the chagrin of many ) , quiz show was dazzling , energetic and convincing .  the horse whisperer represents both his directorial return to nature films and the first time in that sub-genre redford seems equally concerned with humans and scenery .  scott-thomas plays annie maclean , an uptight but respected new york magazine editor whose daughter grace ( johanssen ) loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi .  grace's horse survived , but barely , and has gone mad .  annie refuses to put the animal out of his misery , believing that if the horse heals it will mend grace's newly-broken spirit .  eventually , mother and daughter travel alone to montana to be with tom booker ( redford ) , a famed "" horse whisperer "" who has a gift of calming horses with simple looks and touches , leaving busy husband neill behind .  eventually , they move onto the booker ranch with the rest of tom's family , and annie finds herself falling in love with all things montana , including , naturally , tom , the wise and lonely trainer .  the horse whisperer is delicately made .  i dare say lyrical , since to many people's ear , that word is synonymous with boring .  hardly .  the horse whisperer has little to offer in the way of surprise , but it does have an honesty that is refreshing and consistently enjoyable to watch , especially in the final third of the story .  scott-thomas and johanssen seem like mother and daughter , and you have no doubt believing that the mountain vistas would put these new yorkers under a spell , especially since d . p .  robert richardson's photography casts montana as heaven on earth .   ( a gimmicky but effective technique the filmmakers employ is a switch in aspect ratio from squarish to widescreen when the central location shifts from new york to montana . )  the underrated sam neill turns in perhaps his most heartfelt , emotive performance as the nice-guy husband , who is as authoritive and likeable as tom .  he is indeed a refreshing change from the sexist , lout of a husband so many writers resort to as a short-cut for explaining away the cheating spouse's motivation .  unfortunately , one of the horse whisperer's only flaws is the chemistry between would-be lovers scott-thomas and redford .  i liked both of them , but i didn't necessarily believe that redford would fall for such a cold fish , even if the countryside air thawed her slightly .  luckily ( and curiously ) , this is such a rich and textured movie that it doesn't quite matter-their adultery seems like an afterthought , the obligatory sub-plot that ties many of the characters' complex relationships together .
