1|in 1912 , a ship set sail on her maiden voyage across the atlantic for america .  this ship was built to be the largest ship in the world , and she was .  she was also build to be one of the most luxurious , and that she was .  finally , she was built to be unsinkable and that unfortunately she was not .  to get a ticket for this voyage you either : spent a life's savings to get to america to start life anew , were part of the upper class and had the money to spare , or finally were lucky enough to have a full house in a poker match by the docks like jack dawson .  jack dawson makes the trip , and happens to be at the right place at the right time .  rose dewitt bukater , a first class passenger , climbs the railings at the aft of the ship with thoughts of jumping .  thus is started a tale of romance and intrigue , and a tale of death and tragedy . . .  this movie is about a tragic event that took place a great many years ago , an even that should not be taken lightly as any other bit of historical trivia .  the movie titanic shows what happened , maybe not with a 100% degree of accuracy , but it still shows it very realisticaly .  now the titanic is both a story on its own and a backdrop for a story .  it serves as both admirably , brining forth an interesting story that although simple in its most simple premise is very captivating .  this movie is very emotional simply because of what it is , but that alone is not enough .  the story is brought out with a certain style that makes is so much more emotional and so much more effective .  movies such as this will not be forgotten all too quickly and unfortunately then are not something that is produced by hollywood with any great frequency .  the attention to detail that was paid is remarkable .  the whole premise for the telling of the story is interesting , with the showing of brand new footage from the wreck of the titanic adding much flavor to an already good movie .  part of the magical chemistry behind this story is the acting , and for this movie its extremely good acting from the whole cast .  the performances put in by the main stars is something to be admired .  the characters were played out so memorably that both leonardo dicaprip and kate winslet should receive at the least nominations for their roles .  looking at the acting done in the movie it seems as if they aren't acting but are actually the characters in the movie .  the casting for the movie could really have been better , in my humble opinion that is .  one character that will most likely not be mentioned by any other review or commentary about this film is that of the ship itself .  yes , you read correctly , the ship is a character .  how is the titanic a character ?  you ask well simple , a ship had a certain character about it and as most sailors and boats men will tell you .  this character is everything about the ship from its specifications to its luxuries and the titanic was no stranger to this .  mr . cameron brings the ship to life in an almost literal sense .  all this adds to the movie in a certain way that most hollywood productions cant seem to grasp .  now , to produce the effect that i mentioned above and to sink the ship itself are feats that are accomplished by special effects wizards .  the effects in this movie range from marvelous costumes to beautifully rendered scenes of the ships sinking .  in some respects you cannot tell that the effects are there , you simply think that what you see is what happened or what is happening ( if your imagination is good ) .  the technical wizardry done in this movie is just spectacular and actually getting new footage from the wreck of the titanic is unique .  the movie will leave you amazed at the effects , and that is a feat since there is no monsters or aliens in this movie , just humans and an oversized ship .  the movie will amaze you and it will pull on your emotions , the theater that i went to had a few people leaving with tears in their eyes .  now that is not a feat accomplished by most movies , now the fact that the tragedy actually occurred is brought home with something of a punch , i wont spoil the ending and say what happens regardless it is an interesting movie from beginning to the very end .  the historical value of this movie is quite high , and honestly is something that should be watched for the sake of seeing it and seeing the tragedy , for it is extremely well done .  the method of telling the story is also good , maybe not totally unique but effective none the less .  regardless of anything mentioned above this movie is a grandiose production and the sheer size of the project undertaken is something to be marveled at .  the simple fact that the movie is smashingly successful at what it aims to achieve is just astonishing .  if you get the chance to see this movie go ! ! !  it might not be the best movie in the world . .  but it ranks fairly highly and is well worth the time spent watching it .  during none of the 3 hours and 13 minutes of the movie are you bored nor does your attention wane from the movie .  |0.6|0.7666666666666666|0.7999999999999999|The text's positive sentiment is attributed to the admiration for the Titanic's grandeur, luxury, attention to detail, acting performances, emotional impact, and technical wizardry, as well as the recommendation for others to see the movie.
1|"the start of this movie reminded me of parts from the movie stargate .  people are looking around in an egyptian temple reading about some dangerous thing that is going to destroy earth in the future .  after a sort of confusing bit involving fake-looking cyborg things , the movie jumps into the future and the movie improves by leaps and bounds .  the basic idea behind the movie is that every once in a while ( make that every 1000 years or so ) an evil force comes to destroy earth .  the things needed to defend against this menace are the four elements of nature plus the fifth element .  the plot in this movie really isn't that important to the thing though .  this movie has very good special effects , for the most part .  the techno-ish music in the background fits the mood very well .  bruce willis is an illegal taxi-cab driver in a futuristic new york city .  one day a lady draped with a few bandages drops down into his trunk .  this movie is about what happens .  the plot twists are interesting and the movie never fails to present the viewer with a variety of different locations .  also there is a fair bit of action in the film , particularly towards the end .  some characters are just plain strange including a highly-energetic deejay in drag .  bruce willis does his normal job of blowing things away like he always does .  the movie is definitely watchable and rarely slows down .  it is one of those sci-fi films where you'll be saying "" cool "" followed by a "" what the hell ? ! ? !

1|"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  james toback's return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake's absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue .  embracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters .  fortunately , the film's cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing .  the film's setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly .  we meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft .  as they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they're both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn't take long for them to come to the realisation that they're being two-timed by the same guy .  more indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake's loft and await his arrival for a confrontation .  it's when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride .  played with magnificent bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights .  it's fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film's best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour .  whether he's flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it's never less than wildly entertaining and insightful .  though at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly .   ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla's unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat's out of the bag . )  double-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs .  surprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film .  however , it'd be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou's outrage to full feature-length , and it's as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel .  the dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film's tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat .  subtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale .  one key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla .  two girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr . toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film's thematic narrative is rather dubious .  if anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr . downey jr . , whose versatility is put to the test in this film .  he plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered .  it's a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it's hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake's self-chiding to "" get [his] shit together "" is disquieting in its resonance .  while mr . downey jr . 's showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles .  ms . graham is quickly becoming one of america's more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman .  she's quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry .  meanwhile , ms . gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing .  she tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox .  the film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout .  two girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr . toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors .  while the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn't feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background , and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner .  two girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it's still often an enjoyable , bitingly funny romp , particularly as we watch the surprisingly-resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends .   "" i'm an actor , "" he tells them at one point , using the ol' tried-and-tested occupational-hazard defense .   "" actors lie . ""  but not , they all seem to agree , denzel washington .

1|"robert altman's cookie's fortune is that rare movie that does not depend on sentimentality to be uplifting and to make its viewers feel good .  it is a sunny , delightful , dreamy comedy , filled with lovely performances , skillful direction and topped off with an understated , clever , extraordinary script .  as this is an ensemble piece , it is forced to start of slowly as it introduces us to its characters , all of them residing in a southern town called holly springs .  first we meet willie ( charles s . dutton ) , an honest man with a slight drinking habit .  we then see that willie takes care of an elderly lady nicknamed cookie , who is slowly losing her grip on sanity and is being filled with loneliness , despair , and want of her dead husband .  we cut to camille ( glenn close ) who is obsessively directing a play with her sister cora ( julianne moore ) .  then we briefly get acquainted with emma ( liv tyler ) , an apparent relative of cookie , who is a down-but-not-out teen outcast , still full of love and hope even though she has no real place to live .  we also fleetingly see emma's lover jason ( chris o'donnell ) , an ambitious but far too excitable young cop .  we are now about one quarter through the two hour picture , and robert altman decides that it is time to set the plot in motion .  we see the ecstatic cookie stare hopefully at a picture of her husband .  she exclaims "" here i come ! ""  and then puts a pillow to her face and shoots herself .  soon after , her niece camille stops by to get a fruit salad bowl , comes upstairs , finds cookie dead and flips out .  convinced that suicide is a disgrace and that she will have none of that in her family , she eats the suicide note and convinces her slightly slow ( yet sweet ) sister that it was a murder .  she makes sure that she stages it like a murder as well ; scattering jewelry all over the floor , breaking a few cabinets , windows and doors , and then throwing the gun out in the back yard .  the only reasonable suspect is willie , who immediately gets taken into custody , and put in a jail cell ( they all know he didn't do it , so the cell stays open and he plays scrabble with the sheriff and the faithful emma ) .  meanwhile , the unperturbed camille continues her none-too-subtle manipulations trying to further cover up for the murder while at the same time making her easter play a success .  so begins cookie's fortune , a film aptly described by critic scott renshaw as "" a southern spin on fargo , "" except that this one is far funnier and much more enjoyable than the coen brothers' darker , somewhat disturbing and slightly overrated escapade .  robert altman's slight picture is in some ways reminiscent of something like midnight in the garden of good and evil as well , in that both films focus ( on and off ) on the eccentricities of the residents in a southern us town .  indeed , most of the characters in cookie's fortune are loads of fun to observe , and a portion of them are fascinating and surprisingly multi- dimensional .  glenn close turns in an insubstantial ( in terms of her career ) but magnificent performance as the conniving camille and is also the source of a good portion of the many laughs that we enjoy in this movie , and she is perfectly cast as the prolific "" aunt alexandria "" character , endlessly obsessed with family dignity .  the equally essential role of willie is handled with an intangible grace by veteran thespian charles s . dutton ( mimic , a time to kill )  there is nothing like a movie which leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside hours , even days after the film ends .  cookie's fortune is such a movie .  i loved the light , kindhearted approach altman ( whose last project was the dark , intense drama the gingerbread man ) took towards the tricky subject matter .  i enjoyed the talented ensemble cast .  i even liked the trite "" in the south everybody is related to everybody "" cliche that is inevitably employed by the time this movie draws to a close .  i'm not sure why cookie's fortune had such an all-around pleasing effect on me .  perhaps it's that good ol' southern charm .

1|"niagara niagara ( r ) bob gosse's niagara niagara follows a blueprint not unlike a lot of young-lovers-on-the-road movies .  wild marcy ( robin tunney ) and calm seth ( henry thomas ) meet cute , literally running into each other while shoplifting at a local store .  a mere couple of scenes later , the two embark on a journey to toronto from their small , unnamed american town in pursuit of a rare doll that marcy desperately wants .  along the way , true love inevitably blossoms .  what sets niagara niagara apart , though , is that marcy is afflicted with tourette's syndrome , a neurological disorder that causes sudden muscle and vocal tics .  tunney , displaying an acting range not hinted at in the teenage witch thriller the craft , delivers an astonishing performance that won her the best actress prize at last year's venice film festival .  to term her work a tour-de-force is not to imply that she attacks the scenery ; tunney's effectiveness lies in her modulation and vulnerability , which makes her depiction of marcy's illness--which often causes her to act violently--that much more convincing and tragic .  she and the nicely subtle thomas develop a sweetly innocent and beguilingly off-kilter chemistry .  their journey hits a few rough spots creatively along the way , mostly the fault of writer matthew weiss .  a detour involving a kindly widower ( michael parks ) who takes the couple in brings the story to a screeching halt , and the key character of a trigger-happy pharmacist ( stephen lang ) is highly unbelievable .  but these missteps do not blunt the power of tunney's bravura turn , which carries niagara niagara to a level of poignance it would not have otherwise achieved .

1|notice : this is a review and analysis of exotica .  the first part of this piece is the review , the second part contains some analysis of the movie which might be construed as spoilers .  if you have not seen the movie and after reading the first part you intend to do so , then save the second part for the discussion afterwards .  starring : bruce greenwood , mia kirshner , elias kosteas , don mckellar , arsinee khanijian , sarah polley director : atom egoyan screenplay : atom egoyan  exotica is a film that grows on retrospection .  exotica keeps the viewer guessing about the relationship between the various characters in the film .  all of the people know each other , but apart from that , there seems to be no other reason why to select such set and follow them in this fictional account .  the director hints for possible solutions , using a multi-line plot , so popular with critics in mystery train , and used to good advantage by quentin tarantino in pulp fiction .  exotica reaches a whole new dimension using this technique .  at the end it is surprising to see how well the pieces of the puzzle fit together , in spite their apparent unconnectedness and even misleading features .  the out-of-chronological-order technique has become ever so popular , perhaps even de rigueur , for biographical films .  similarly , we can now expect to see more movies in the future which will use , to varying extent , converging multiplots .  on a first glance , once the multi-plot puzzle in exotica is solved , there seems to be little left to look at .  but perceptive minds which take the time to dig further will be rewarded with interesting views on life or rather , commentaries on views of life .  exotica is very much worth seeing .  it opened to critic's praise worldwide ( i first saw it in mexico city , last december ) .  in canada , it broke records for a movie of its kind , which prompted the american distributor to go for a wide release .  apart from a strong plot , acting is very convincing , and the soundtrack seems as if made for the movie .  the spoon-fed-entertainment crowd may not appreciate this movie , and thus it might last little on screen .  but if you want to try a movie a cut above the crowd , with an originality that is ever so rare , by all means see exotica .  analysis ( * * spoilers * * ahead )  what is behind the complex plot in exotica ?  first , a common theme of the quest for gratification by monetary means .  the lone tax-auditor , the repressed homosexual pet shop owner , the pregnant woman which runs the nightclub , the rich man which has the club remodeled , the audience at the movie theatre , all use personal wealth to buy palliative relief for the penuries of the soul . . . .  then we have the quest for gratification through visual means by most of the same people , including those who sit watching exotica . . . .  in that regard exotica stands for onlookers at a nightclub , for the rich man looking through silver mirrors , and poor-rich people looking at other's people lives through a silver screen .  exotica also stands for unwanted society attention into the lives of other people , such as the tax auditor and the pet shop owner .  exotica is the customer agent looking at the pet shop owner , which in turn is looking at the core of the problems between the strip dancer and the tax auditor through the detached eye of a gay person ( no attraction to the strip dancer ) , and only interested on avoiding jail ( no personal relationship with the tax auditor ) .  in exotica everybody is watching , and what is worse , everybody knows .  second , exotica is about isolated people holding back their feelings ; about people which by voluntary or involuntary means transfer their view of reality to other characters .  the strip dancer becomes the proverbial daughter , the dj becomes the proverbial killer by means of breaking the relationship between the father and the proverbial daughter .  the niece becomes the baby sitter , the baby sitter becomes the dancer , and the dancer becomes the proverbial daughter .  the pet shop owner becomes the proverbial dj , by finding the proverbial daughter .  a chain made of real and imagined links coming around full circle , just as everything comes around to a fitting whole at the end of the movie .  |0.5|0.8000000000000002|0.6999999999999998|"The sentiment of the explanations is positive and they collectively discuss the film ""Exotica,"" highlighting its complex plot, strong acting, and originality.

1|"i actually am a fan of the original 1961 or so live-action-disney flick of the same name starring hayley mills twice as a pair of twins , separated at birth by divorcing parents , never to come in contact with the other so the parents never have to meet again .  and everyone should know how i feel about remakes , especially of films i happen to enjoy ( my fallacy : unless you're going to either capture the same exact spirit of the original or do something different with it or maybe even both , just wrack your brain and come up with a * gasp * new idea ) .  this remake was not originally on the top of my viewing list , and was actually quite the opposite .  contemporary live-action-disney films are not one of my favorties , anyway : they're usually unfunny , alienating , and a big fat bore , at least to anyone over the age of 11 and above the iq of 10 .  this one , however , is shockingly not bad .  in fact , it's actually good .  not the original good , but what's great about it is that it doesn't necessarily retread the original or capture the same exact spirit as it does become entertaining for the same exact reasons the original was entertaining .  because it's cute and innocent fun .  because it has a pretty killer plot that is endlessly fun to follow along with .  because the lead star is immensely appealing .  because the parents are also immensely appealing .  and ( i'm repeating myself ) because it's cute and innocent fun .  there's nothing too risque about it , save the plot ( the idea of separating twins and denying them the truth for years is ominously selfish , but that is precisely the point of the movie ) , and it's aimed directly at either kids , adults who want to remember the original , or young adults who want to remember what it was like to be a kid .  i , personally , am somewhere between the second and third .  i can vividly remember when my taste in movies wasn't so weird or diverse ( the names godard and kubrick weren't even a glimmer in my right eye back then ) , when i would tune in every sunday night for a couple years to see abc's "" wonderful world of disney , "" where they'd show you a live-action and/or made-for-tv disney flick an hour per week .  i can remember my mom taking my sister and i along with all my friends and their mothers to see all the rereleased disney films ( like "" lady and the tramp "" and "" pinnochio "" ) .  and , most sadly , i remember every single christmas , without fail , there were a barage of children's animated half-hour shows , made exclusively for the christmas season , that i wouldn't dare missing .  i can even remember seeing the made-for-tv "" parent trap ii "" on tv one night , and after i had seen that one over and over and over again , i saw the original "" parent trap . ""  it's more of a late childhood movie , because it deals with the issue of divorce , but it deals with it in a disney-ized version .  it's playful , and witty , and charming , and if i saw it for the first time right now , having never experienced that part of my childhood , i'd probably dismiss it .  i'd probably do the same for the new version of the same movie if i hadn't seen the original at such a perfect age .  watching it , i could remember what fun it was to watch a disney film , and how divorce for me started to get me thinking about the possibilities of my seemingly-perfect parents splitting up , and how it affected my adolescence .  and also how it brushed that fear off with a smooth stroke , and pointed out that even in the most fucked-up of situations , things could always work out if you , well , manipulate things a bit , at least for the better .  this new version did that for me , but it's also charming in its own way .  it has a new cast , a contemporary feel , and , for the first time in awhile for a live-action-disney flick , a tone that isn't corny or condescending , but just right .  the moments that would otherwise seem corny are actually affecting in a safe kind of way .  and for the first time since the original film , the kids actually know better than the foolish adults .  the story is basically classic by now , repeated almost as many times as kurosawa's "" the seven samurai "" : a pair of twins ( played here by lindsay lohan , just like they were played by hayley mills in the original ) are separated at birth by their divorcing parents .  one , annie , is sent to live with the mother ( natasha richardson , resembling her mother , vanessa redgrave , more than i had ever noticed ) in london , where she lives with her parents and her devoted , foppish butler ( simon kunz ) , as she works as a swingin' fashion designer .  she grows up refined and classy , but also with a keen knowledge in sports and poker-playing .  the other , hallie , is sent to northern california with her father ( dennis quaid ) to live on a vineyard with their pseudo-maid ( lisa ann walter ) , and grows up rugged yet charming .  they both meet at the same camp , one that annie wants to go to to become more rugged .  they feud because they look all-too similar , and are thus in tight competition , which results in some nasty pranks , which winds them in seclusion together in a private , out-of-the-way cabin .  there , they become friends , then learn about eachother .  once they know everything , they concoct a scheme to switch places so the one can meet the other parent , whom they've only heard of .  they learn about eachother's lives in detail , they make sure they look alike ( which requires hair cutting and , notoriously , ear-piercing - a scene which is like the kiddie version of the hypodermic needle scene in "" pulp fiction "" ) , and when the end of summer comes , they switch and hope for the best .  lindsay lohan doesn't necessarily copy the acting style of hayley mills in the original .  but she comes off just as appealing as she did once .  she does , though , add a couple new things : she makes the california twin a little more appealing and the london twin a bit more frank and snobbish than the snotty and proper original , respectively .  she also adds on an american and british accent to each one , with one faking the other accent throughout , and if you really take notice , you can see that the fake ones' accents aren't exactly perfect .  she's also incredibly appealing , not merely cute , which is especially notable since this is her first feature film , and we know how notorious child actors are , especially in their first films .  she makes a great protagonist , and it only helps that the supporting cast is equally appealing .  dennis quaid , in fact , hasn't been this likable in about a decade - his big dumb smile and near cocky attitude is what has made him a notable actor in the past , not just that he's mr . meg ryan .  ditto natasha richardson ( except that she just hasn't ever been this likable period ) .  the two make a winning couple , maybe not so winning as maureen o'hara and the late brian keith in the original , but they still work for this film .  instead of the bickering that ensued in the original , the film adds another dimension and another angle to their characters that was amiss in the original : during the opening credits , we see glimpses from their courtship on the qe2 , where they fall quickly and madly in love with eachother , and when back together again , the film's more smarmy scenes come off as actually sentimental , but in that great way , not the migraine-inducing way as in many such films .  this all brings this new "" parent trap "" to a level of entertainment that hasn't really existed since , well , the original film years ago , still my money the best live-action-disney flick of all time .  this is because it has a form of intelligence and wit that makes such plot points as an otherwise standard villainous love interest subplot ( a gold-digging sharon stone type , played by elaine hendrix , who's deliciously tormented by the twins later on in the film ) a treat instead of a bore .  like the original , this film transcends all the crap that it very well could be ( case in point : "" it takes two "" starring the olsen twins ) because it treats the children as the smart ones , and the adults as the silly ones , not the other way around .  and because , above everything , it knows exactly how to be charming without biting off more than it can chew .  however , in comparison with the original , it could be a bit better .  certain scenes work well , but not nearly as well as they worked in the original .  i liked the way the parents fought over past dilemnas and then fought over falling in love again better than i liked watching two old flames getting back together over a bottle of wine - somehow , feuding is always more cinematic and pleasing than mere reminscing , a lesson extracted from the howard hawks/cary grant films of yesteryear .  and as much as this film transcends mere cutedom , compared to the original , this film almost drowns in cutedom .  the original , though not gritty , was far more stylized and just as suitable for adult audiences as it was for young audiences .  as such , this remake may never be nearly as great or classic as the original film , but it at least knows how to treat its source material with dignity and respect , and how to create virtually the same effects without bordering on plagerism or petty annoyances .  "|0.6833333333333332|0.8833333333333334|0.9|The overall sentiment is positive, as the user initially had skepticism towards the remake but ended up enjoying it. They appreciate the cute and innocent fun, the appealing lead star, and entertaining plot, while also acknowledging that the original may still be superior.
1|"gere , willis , poitier chase each other around the world  the jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman  when the soviet union imploded , the western countries lost their shadow .  with the united states friendly with the russians , we no longer had an entity to blame for the world's problems .  this showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy .  it's time to rejoice because we've found our new villain .  now it's no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands , it's the russian _mafia_ .  a perfect solution , it combines the dread of organized crime and the still-present uneasiness with the former eastern block countries .  best of all , the villains are still foreigners : fear of the other always plays best .  so it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal ( bruce willis ) to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid .  the fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they're not sure even exists .  coming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen ( richard gere ) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston ( sidney poitier ) and russian major valentina koslova ( diane venora ) .  mulqueen's ex-girlfriend basque terrorist isabella ( mathilda may ) is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal .   ( presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met . )  the film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his $70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn't slip away .  crossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini-van , the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers .  being very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller "" the day of the jackal "" , comparison between the two films is inevitable .  there is no doubt that the original is the better movie , playing the story for suspense rather than the current action/adventure .  as a mystery , "" the jackal "" has enough holes in it to ruin the tale , but if you can accept it for what it is , there's entertainment to be had .  holes ? let's see ? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up .  for a 20-year veteran that can command the big bucks , the jackal is an incredibly poor shot .  the final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police , but it's just the two of them .  willis' disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmer's in "" the saint "" .   ( and lest you misunderstand , that's not a compliment . )  but the three stars are fun to watch .  it's good to see gere in something other than a business suit .  willis has a mixed history in picking projects , but his characters are always watchable .  poitier is by far the superior actor , but has limited screen time .  the problems in logic are flaws , but don't ruin the experience .  occasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes .  this is one of them .

1|"it's terribly unfortunate that "" stir of echoes , "" tautly written and directed by david koepp ( who made one of 1996's unsung treasures , "" the trigger effect "" ) , should be released little more than a month after "" the sixth sense , "" which is still going strong at the box office .  these two films are undoubtedly going to be compared ( judging from practically all of my fellow audience members last night ) , and although they have eerily similar storylines , "" stir of echoes "" is more of a straightforward psychological horror film , while "" the sixth sense "" is closer to a psychological drama .  additionally , while "" the sixth sense "" had a shocker of an ending that undoubtedly has been one of the major factors in its recent repeat business , "" stir of echoes "" is more conventional and predictable in its final twist .  and where "" the sixth sense "" was disturbing , "" stir of echoes "" is just plain scary .  i have a feeling most viewers are going to come away unimpressed because of the unavoidable similarities , and will foolishly forget to judge this film on its own respectable merits .  adapted from a novel by richard matheson that was written some forty years ago , "" stir of echoes "" opens with a cute six-year-old boy named jake ( zachary david cope ) who is taking a bath .  he is speaking directly at the screen , but we immediately have a feeling someone else is there .  finally , he asks , "" does it hurt to be dead ? ""  apparently jake sees the ghosts of dead people , but unlike "" the sixth sense , "" this young child isn't the focus of the picture .  instead , tom witzy ( kevin bacon ) , a chicago lineman , is our protagonist .  jake is his son , and maggie ( kathryn erbe ) , whom has just discovered she is six weeks pregnant , is his hard-working wife .  one night while at a party with their closest friends , tom convinces maggie's new-age sister , lisa ( illena douglas ) , to try and hypnotize him .  it unexpectedly works , and before long , tom is seeing things he wouldn't normally see , including a deceased teenage girl ( jenny morrison ) in his house who happens to have been missing for the last six months .  seeking help from lisa , she tells him that , while he was under hypnosis , she told him that after he awoke , his mind will remain clear and free , like an opened door .  she didn't expect it to work , but it did , and the only way to stop it is for tom to somehow find a way to help this girl he sees .   "" stir of echoes "" isn't a perfect film by any stretch of the imagination , but in the thick , atmospheric mood it conjures up , it is a terrifically eerie domestic horror-drama , and is not only effective on a technical level , but is impressive in its portrayal of a struggling working-class family .  kevin bacon and , especially , kathryn erbe ( 1997's "" dream with the fishes "" ) , are top-notch and exceedingly believable as a loving married couple who nonetheless have their fair share of problems .  after tom is hypnotized and starts seeing ghastly visions , he is completely taken over by his desire to solve this mystery of the disappearing girl whom he has seen lurking in his house , and instead of maggie not being understanding , she instead believes what tom says , and aside from being a little worried by what he is going through , does not try to stop his pursuit .  bacon and erbe are not traditional hollywood stars like tom cruise and julia roberts , and therefore , are easier to relate to and always plausible as a struggling couple who have to work overtime at their jobs just to make ends meet .  in a masterfully-done , entrancing sequence , tom is hypnotized by lisa , but instead of watching him , we instead see what he sees , starting from his view as he closes his eyes into darkness .  lisa tells him to visualize being in an empty movie theater , and so , we , as audience members , are watching a movie screen from inside a theater , which is also showing a movie screen in a theater .  telling him to move closer and closer to the screen as a fuzzy word in black letters pops up on the screen , we begin to float closer and closer to the front of the theater until we see that the word is "" sleep . ""  never before have i seen a hypnotism scene as mesmerizing and brilliantly-construed as this one .  truthfully , this set-piece , and another in which tom wakes up from a nightmarish dream only to quickly discover he is reliving what he has just dreamt , are worth the full price of admission alone , just to see them on the big screen .  having loads of fun with her small role as maggie's sister , lisa , illeana douglas ( 1995's "" to die for , "" her last great character ) is a delight , but rarely used to her full advantage in feature films .  funny and enjoyably offbeat , douglas gets to utter the best line in the film : while talking to maggie about tom's visions of the girl , she remarks , "" i wouldn't be worried about him seeing another girl , although the fact that she's dead gives one pause . ""  also of note are jenny morrison ( 1994's "" intersection "" ) , who is truly poignant in the last half of the film when we flash back to see what really happened to her missing character , and liza weil , remarkable in 1998's "" whatever , "" as morrison's grieving teenage sister , debbie .  if the resolution of "" stir of echoes "" does not live up to its obviously frightful full potential ( and it doesn't ) , what comes before is both involving and appropriately gritty .  the music score , by james newton howard , and unsettling use of whispers and ghostly sound effects , successfully compliment and foreshadow the off-kilter frame-of-mind that tom is put into , and director david koepp proves once again that he is a director with a knack for creating almost unbearably tense situations that revolve around realistically-written characters .   "" stir of echoes "" isn't as good as "" the sixth sense , "" but why should it need to be ?  both films are fully capable of standing on their own two feet , and "" stir of echoes "" really is a spinetinglingly good horror film .

1|"usually when a blockbuster comes out , it's loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action .  mystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year .  the film is based upon the comic book series "" the flaming carrot "" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) .  things go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city .  well , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance .  this is where the film takes a turn for the better .  in the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes .   "" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , "" mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and "" the shoveller ( william h . macy ) .  sure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast .  that is until they aquire "" invisible boy "" ( kel mitchell ) , and "" the bowler "" ( janeane garafalo ) and "" mr . splein "" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess .  thankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen .  the whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest .  for one , the film is considerably clever .  it literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way .  a part of the cleverness comes from the cast .  sometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here .  while azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out .  one was paul reuben .  no matter how disgusting or revolting "" mr . splein "" may be , you still can't help but laugh .  it' so incredibly moronic , it's just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions .  janeane garafalo also was an interesting character .  she seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing .  men is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes .  on the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off .  kel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless .  their parts were so limited , they'd be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes .  ben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue .  none of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film .  as far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects .  while the set designs and action all look nice , i'm glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud .  slow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers .  it forgets about money making , because it's not likely to make a bundle like it's proceeders , and that's what works .  stupid ?  maybe , but for once i'm not disappointed .  no one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year .

1|review- peter jackson's the frighteners has received some notice for setting the record for most computer effects ever in a movie , and still coming in at the extremely cheap $30 million price tag .  but for those who were dismayed by this year's blockbusters like twister and independence day , the frighteners has much more to offer than special effects .  and for those worried wether or not peter jackson would compromise to hollywood you can rest easily .  the frighteners is as far removed from hollywood as a high-profile movie can get .  michael j . fox stars as frank bannister , a con artist who can speak to ghosts .  he uses this ability to set up a scam in a small town where his ghost buddies scare the hell out of people , then he comes and pretends to get rid of them .  this is how he has made a living ever since his wife died in a car crash 5 years ago .  frank's latest customers are a young couple , played by trini alvarado and peter dobson .  when dobson ends up dead , alvarado starts to take an interest in fox .  but dobson's spirit is still around as he refuses to beleive he's dead .  this leads to a very awkward and amusing dinner date between fox and alvarado , with dobson tagging along as a ghost .  things start getting complicated for fox when he is accused for a series of murders taking place in the town .  fox sees someone named the soul collector crushing the heart of the victims , but noone else can see that .  so when fox shows up to try and save each victim , naturally people suspect he is the killer .  fox sees that alvarado is next on the soul collector's hit list , and the last half hour of the movie deals with fox's attempts to save her from this evil spirit .  there are many wonderful twists and turns in the screenplay written by peter jackson and frances walsh .  the movie starts off as a black comedy , and ends up a horror-action film .  the mix between these genres are perfect .  no laughs are sacrificed in the name of horror , and vice versa .  one point of contention might be a lackluster score by danny elfman .  but that hardly seems like a flaw when you have such a diverse cast all in top form .  michael j . fox delivers one of his best performances to date as a man who hides the sorrow of his wife's death , and then is forced to confront this later on .  alvarado , looking like andie macdowell , makes a great frightened , tough , and smart heroine .  and jeffery combs , as a paranoid fbi agent , is brilliantly bizaare .  the frighteners never once feels like it is running long .  the first hour is as funny as any comedy this year , and the last half hour is as thrilling as any of the big budget blockbusters .  this movie is probably what casper would've looked like if david lynch directed it .  it's easily the best film of the year , so far .  |0.7416666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive, praising the film for its special effects, diverse cast, twists and turns in the screenplay, and the performances of the actors.

1|"before you read my review , you gotta know that i love woody allen .  this is a very important note because allen's films are generally an acquired taste and definitely not for everyone .  i know folks who believe him to be a complete genius , while others see him as a dirty ol' schnook who keeps making the same movie over and over again .  i love most of his films , but will admit to having been quite disappointed by his recent crop during the 90s .  in fact , why he felt the need to make 10 movies in those 10 years is beyond me !  if you look at the quality of those films , you'll hear what i'm saying .  the only two films of his that i really liked during that time were bullets over broadway and husbands and wives .  in fact , i secretly hoped that he would take some "" time off "" at the turn of the millennium , just to re-energize or something , but it doesn't appear as though he has any intention of doing that .  so here i am again , reviewing yet another woody allen movie and hoping that it brings back the woody from the days of old .  plot : the year is 1940 and woody allen is a top-notch insurance investigator .  his methods are very old-fashioned and apparently out of date .  a new employee ( hunt ) has just been hired to streamline the operations for greater efficiency .  the two do not like each other .  one night , they are both put under a hypnotic trance by a magician , and unbeknownst to them , placed under his control .  soon thereafter , jewels are stolen , words of love are exchanged and everyone is looking for an answer .  critique : a wonderful recreation of the 1940s style movies , with the fast-talking witty banter between co-workers , a catchy jazz score moving things along , film noirish elements such as the veronica lake-type sexpot , one-liners galore and a fluffy , if inconsequential plotline .  on the downside , the film actually starts off pretty slowly , with the first hour tossing only a few guffaws out there , but never really generating any kind of steady flow or energy .  the sets , on the other hand , were amazing , the production design and costumes were perfect , and the casting ideal , so i kept hoping that the film would pick up and not turn into yet another mediocre outing for the man .  but it wasn't not long before i was fully engaged by the characters , entertained by the many zingers delivered back-and-forth between allen and hunt , and actually interested in the resolution of the flick .  i also appreciated how allen played the fine line between homage to the films of old , parody and actual reinvention ( note theron's entire female persona that is drenched in film noir- very cool ) .  of course , films like this ( with little or no real tension in the plot ) need solid actors to keep you interested in the quick-fire dialogue , and once again , allen does a great job in playing his character , who for once , isn't his typical new york jewish neurotic cheating insecure husband dude .  he actually plays a "" macho "" guy here and handles it pretty well , especially the scenes in which he's hypnotized .  but the bigger surprise for me in this film was helen hunt , an actress who i was openly "" sick of seeing "" in movies late last year ( sorry babe , you were just in too many at the same time ! ) .  anyway , she's really great in this film as the headstrong woman looking to a new era of equality amongst men , and doesn't miss a beat of allen's fast-paced dialogue .  i didn't care much for her running joke about him "" dying "" whenever he left a room , but overall she was really good and i especially liked the way that her sweaters clung to her breasts as they did . . . yum ,  yum !  harumph , but i digress .  so let's recap .  a great looking picture with a nice jazzy score , some funny one-liners , especially in the second half , a decent plotline , although you shouldn't expect a real mystery or anything , and some solid acting all around .  i can't say that this is even remotely close to any of allen's best work , but i certainly believe it to be a step in the right direction , especially after the dinky decade of films that he just went through .  it's probably better geared towards allen fans more than anyone else , but i would still recommend this film to anyone looking for a cute , "" old-school "" kind of vibe , with chemistry between the leads , zippy dialogue and a satisfying conclusion .  little known facts about this film and its stars : annie hall ( 10/10 ) - celebrity ( 5/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - husbands and wives ( 9/10 ) - mighty aphrodite ( 5/10 ) - small time crooks ( 7/10 ) - when harry met sally ( 10/10 ) - you've got mail ( 4/10 )  "|-0.3333333333333333|0.7666666666666666|0.20000000000000004|The reviewers express a combination of disappointment and hope for Woody Allen's recent films, highlighting both praise and criticism for the film's style, acting, and plot.

1|"what do you get when you combine clueless and dumb and dumber ?  to answer the question , you get director david mirkin's new comedy romy and michele's high school reunion .  romy white ( mira sorvino , mighty aprhodite ) and michele weinberger ( lisa kudrow , tv's friends ) have been inseparable buddies since they graduated from sagebrush high in 1987 .  however , when former classmate heather mooney ( janeane garafolo , the truth about cats and dogs ) confronts romy about the 10 year reunion , she is astounded that she forgot .  watching pretty woman for the um-teenth time , they are reminded of how they wouldn't let julia roberts' character shop in the expensive stores because of her appearance .  then it hits them : they are not successful .  what are she and michele going to do ?  romy's instant solution is lose some weight off their already slender frames , "" bag a couple of boyfriends , "" and get jobs .  romy says this will be easy , but michele retorts that if it is so easy , why hadn't they already done it .  robin schiff's script keeps the show moving with some nice one-liners .  one of the best has romy reminiscing about her life's battle against the bathroom scales .

1|martin scorsese's triumphant adaptation of edith wharton's the age of innocence is a stunning film for the quintessential new york filmmaker , the man who brought the streets of taxi driver and mean streets to life .  it seems like an odd choice for scorsese to do a period piece in the early 1900's , but the fact that he pulls it off so brilliantly is a wonder , and a testament to the greatness of scorsese as a filmmaker .  this is a gorgeous visual experience that it surely one of scorsese's finest .  newland archer ( day-lewis ) is a prestigious lawyer who is engaged to may welland ( ryder ) , a somewhat empty and shallow new yorker , who belongs to a prestigious family and is quite beautiful .  the marriage is one which will unite two very prestigious families , in a society where nothing is more important than the opinions of others .  on the day that archer is to announce his engagement to may , countess ellen olenska ( pfeiffer ) , cousin of may , walks into archer's life .  archer is immediately captivated , and finds himself in love with ellen .  archer is also bound by the limits of new york society , which is an intrusive as any other in the world .  archer finds himself having a secret love affair in his mind with countess olenska , attempting to keep her in his mind while trying not to lose his social status .  the film's subject matter may seem alien to scorsese , but the theme is definitely not .  it is a theme of forbidden romance , guilty pleasures , and the consequences causes because of those actions .  there is a painstakingly flawed hero , and his choice between the life he wants , and the life he is destined for .  in truth , it is a film about a society the audience doesn't know about , but wants to find out more , much like the society of goodfellas or even kundun .  the performances are absolutely breathtaking .  day-lewis portrays more mental anguish in his face than one man should be forced to take .  pfeiffer is marvelous as countess olenska , a mix of passion and beauty that the audience would die for as well .  ryder is probably the gem of the group , for it is her quiet presence that overwhelms the plot , and slowly pushes day-lewis closer and closer to his eventual ending .  the supporting cast is also wonderful , with several characters so singular that they are indelible in one's memory .  scorsese definitely has a passion for filmmaking .  his lavish and sumptuous set design and marvelous recreation of new york is a wondrous sight .  he literally transports the viewer to another world with incredible imagery .  his script is also excellent , slow in buildup , with a rapid conclusion and a fantastic ending that has to be seen to be believed .  it is difficult to make a period piece gripping : scorsese , however , does it beautifully .  the famous cameras of the legendary director are also everywhere .  he is patient , but he films everything and anything remotely important .  the cameras sweep , pan , track , and do more than they've ever done , but they are so subtle , one doesn't realize he's watching all the scorsese hallmarks until a 2nd viewing .  the central tracking shot is probably longer and more complex than the famous goodfellas shot , but the viewer doesn't notice it , because we want to see more of this gorgeous world .  there are a few deft touches of filmmaking that are simply outstanding , and joanne woodward' narration is exquisite .  not a fast film like goodfellas , this shares more in common with kundun than anything else .  and like kundun , this is a slow-starting film that truly shines , when given the chance to fully breathe and bloom in the end .  a beautiful film by a director continuing to challenge himself year after year .  |0.9186666666666667|0.9166666666666666|0.9|"The user's prompt expresses overwhelmingly positive sentiment towards Martin Scorsese's film ""The Age of Innocence.""

1|"wyatt earp has a lot to tell and little to say .  this story of the legendary lawman runs three hours and nine minutes and that's too long for this epic-wannabe that plays more like a tv mini-series than a movie .  the story opens on the earp family farm , with young wyatt ready to run away from home .  he wants to fight in the civil war , but his dad ( hackman ) has different ideas and wants his son to study law .  time passes and wyatt heads west , returns home to marry , and , after a spell , begins his career in law enforcement .  by the time he ( costner ) and his brothers ( madsen , david andrews , and linden ashby ) arrive in tombstone , wyatt has tried his hand at everything from hunting buffalo to dealing cards .  wyatt earp is very appealing in places-- such as cast , costumes , and cinematography-- but an overstated story and overpowered score deaden most of the emotional impact .  who can be moved by scene after scene after scene of swelling strings and suffocating speeches ?  somber is fine-- just ask clint eastwood-- but this film that boasts not one , not two , but three , count 'em three , hammy death scenes !  still , a little bit of earp goes a long way and the life and times of the legendary lawman are from uninteresting stuff .  his , uh , unusual relations with women , for example , are an intriguing contrast to his character's credo of "" nothing counts as much as blood .

1|"when i first heard that kevin costner was making a movie called "" the postman , "" i thought , "" an american version of 'il postino ? '  starring costner ?  god help us ! ""  when i found out that it was not a remake of "" postino "" but an postapocalyptic epic , i thought , "" 'landworld ? '  please , god , make him stop ! ""  as it turns out , "" the postman "" is a much better film than i had expected .  despite being set in 2013 , the movie is , at heart , a western : a band of thugs terrorizes peaceful villagers ; a wandering hero opposes the bandits and inspires others to fight back .  the setting , however , allows that familiar plot to take on greater significance : american society has collapsed due to plagues and wars , and survivors live behind barracades in isolated villages .  the struggle of a dead society to be reborn has a grand quality and deserves the epic scale costner grants it .  costner's nameless character , a wandering actor , rides in from the vast wasteland and is soon shanghaied into the service of general bethlehem ( will patton ) , a former copy-machine salesman turned bandit king .  our hero escapes and discovers the body of a dead postman .  taking the uniform and bag of mail , he passes himself off as a representative of "" the restored united states . ""  he is shocked at the hope that he inspires in the people he meets .  one young disciple , ford lincoln mercury ( larenz tate ) , organizes a full-scale postal service .  ford spreads the postman's message of hope until bethlehem finds that the once-meek villagers are beginning to resist his rule .  as war breaks out between bethlehem's army and the postal workers , costner's character steps into the legend he created and goes from self-centered loner to leader of the revolution .  his lie of the restored united states becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy .   "" postman "" is an odd blend of a bleak setting and a message of wide-eyed optimism ( sort of "" sergio leone meets frank capra "" ) , but its treatment of hope and renewal is compelling .  what could have been another knock-off of "" the road warrior "" ( like "" waterworld "" was ) surprises the viewer with a sensitively told story of nobility emerging from rubble .  tate is the stand-out in the movie's large cast .  ford lincoln mercury ( self-named ) is the polar opposite of o-dog , tate's character in his debut film , "" menace ii society "" ( 1993 ) , and tate makes ford's innocent belief in hope as convincing as o-dog's cynicism and brutality .  his performance sells the movie .  interestingly , as tate moves from his usual street-smart roles to youthful optimism , the soft-eyed patton , who usually plays nice guys , proves a disarming villain .  olivia williams makes her film debut as the postman's love interest , abby .  when they first meet , abby asks him to father her child because her husband is sterile .  predictably , the husband is soon eliminated by the bandits , and abby is thrown back into the company of the hero .  however , their relationship develops slowly as the emotional conflicts of both characters are explored ( she , torn by grief , guilt , and anger ; he , resisting his destiny ) .   "" the postman "" is costner's best work thus far .  perhaps that alone gives us hope for the future .   .   .

1|"in zoolander , the world's most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , "" is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? ""  obviously , the film's creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ?  no , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more .  much like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie .  it's not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek's model roommates all die in a tragic "" gasoline fight "" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) .  but it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused .  better yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag .  zoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs .  fashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed .  enter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight .  on the trail of mugatu's plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller's real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she's hoping to use mugatu's pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme .  much like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today .  wilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel .  ferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers .  jerry stiller -- ben's dad who's best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek's slimy agent maury ballstein .  even ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse .  as for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he's stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners .  unfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here .  maybe it's just because i can't stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn't had sex in two years .  she leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would've added real comic substance to the flimsy role .  while zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days .  zoolander's no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction .

1|originally titled 'don't lose your head' , this parody of the scarlet pimpernel story was the first carry on to be produced by rank film productions .  two english fops , the 'powdered , be-wigged , be-ribboned' sir rodney ffing ( sidney james ) and his counterpart lord darcy pew ( jim dale ) decide to travel to revolutionary france in an attempt to rescue their fellow french royalists and aristocrats from losing their heads by the guillotine .  due to a series of machinations and disguises , they are largely successful .  ffing becomes known as 'the black fingernail' because he leaves a calling card behind which shows two fingers sticking up , one with a black fingernail .  after the fingernail rescues a prominent royalist the duc de pommfrit ( charles hawtrey ) , citizen robespierre ( peter gilmore ) orders the head of the secret police citizen 'the big cheese' camembert ( kenneth williams ) and citizen bidet ( peter butterworth ) to follow the fingernail to england and do away with him .

1|"if there is one thing that bothers me about hollywood films it's their predictable endings .  the devil's advocate has the atypical hollywood ending , when everything that should happen does .  unfortunately for the devil's advocate , this ending nearly collapses in on itself , and ruins the entire film .  nevertheless , the film does provide two and a half hours of pure entertainment ( note to self : kill whomever was in charge of the previews for this film ) .  i don't think i was quite prepared for this movie because the trailers made it appear to be some supernatural horror film about satan .  well , it does contain this element , but what is not mentioned in the ads is the other plot elements ( and seemingly more interesting ones at that ) .  the devil's advocate begins in florida with an ongoing trial in session .  kevin lomax ( keanu reeves ) is the defense attorney , working for a client whom has been accused of raping a young girl .  he ends up with a not-guilty verdict , despite an emotional testimony from the victim ( heather matarazzo ) .  he leaves the courthouse with his lovely wife mary ann ( charlize theron ) where he is approached with an offer to travel to new york city to help choose a good jury .  he accepts ( mainly after seeing the paycheck he will receive ) and he flies to new york with his wife .  after proving his worth for selecting juries ( and his perfect winning streak in court ) , the head of the firm , john milton ( al pacino ) , asks him to work permanently as a criminal lawyer .  he graciously accepts , where he is treated almost as a god .  he is given an incredible apartment ( which is bigger than my entire house now ) , and a hefty paycheck .  his life seems to be on the rise .  and of course , his life suddenly begins to waver and slowly decline .  he is attracted to fellow employee christabella ( connie nielson ) , and his wife begins to feel very lonely in her large apartment .  mary ann takes up a friendship with a neighbor who always gives advice , especially if it is not wanted .  meanwhile , kevin nabs a case surrounding alexander cullen ( craig t . nelson ) who apparently murdered three people .  he spends hours upon hours with this case , while forgetting his loving wife , who may or may not be going insane .  all of this while john milton may or may not be the devil himself .  after a while , things turn completely upside-down , as kevin's wife claims to have seen monstrous images superimposed on her friends .  a fellow employee is murdered in the park , and his mother ( judith ivey ) reveals information about kevin's real father .  is it all just a big nightmare ?  or is john milton really satan , playing tricks with kevin's life ?  the devil's advocate plays out fairly straight-forward , but for some odd reason , the screenwriters wanted to surprise everyone by giving us something we don't expect .  is this surprise conclusion supposed to make us feel good and go home without feeling depressed or disturbed ?  if so , the devil's advocate messes up completely , and ironically , i felt more depressed because of the ending as is now , than i would have if it had ended ten minutes early .  i went into the devil's advocate expecting a shocking horror film , and that is exactly what i got .  i was settled in to be disturbed mentally and emotionally , and that is what i got .  but what was the most disturbing and horrible aspect of the movie is the poor ending ( did i mention that i didn't like the ending ? ) .  the producers of this film take you on a thrilling roller coaster ride and just as it is ending , they pull the rug out from under you .  films like se7en and the usual suspects can survive with this surprise ending because it is expected , more or less .  we know it is going to end in an unpredictable way .  the devil's advocate , on the other hand , ends unpredictably , not from us knowing a lot , but knowing nothing at all .  if that is confusing , i recommend watching the film , and then reading that again .  as for the film overall , i enjoyed the entire first two hours , being drawn in by a terrific character study and then adding the supernatural plot to increase the tension build from the character study .  the film runs like a well-built clock , slowly building until finally exploding with a highly charged climax ( and an unpredictable one at that ) .  and then you settle in for a nice resolution , which does not occur .  it was at this point that i felt cheated .  taking us on a terror ride of intrigue , we follow kevin lomax around , as he is the centerpiece of the film .  everything occurs from his perspective .  he is our representation on screen ( sort of ) .  but we are forced to witness a conclusion which makes most of the film seem like a game .  i don't want to spoil the ending , so all i can say is go see the film and decide for yourself .  perhaps the most shocking thing about the devil's advocate is the extreme amount of everything .  it earned its r rating for a reason .  there is plenty of nudity , sex , violence , gore , and then you have gore , violence , sex , and more nudity .  this film really isn't subtle about anything , showing us everything .  it actually surprises me that this film did not receive an nc-17 rating , as it is quite harsh .  however , the movie does have its merits , and nudity and sex are among those .  i don't condone sex and nudity in films , but if its there , i might as well enjoy it .  the biggest merit of this film is also the most interesting to watch .  the confrontations between kevin lomax and john milton are entertaining , but what stands out amidst this extreme hatred is the decline of the wife , mary ann .  portrayed by the extremely effective charlize theron , mary ann's problems are incredibly intense , and i found myself wanting to witness her decline .  this may sound uncaring , but i wanted to watch because i felt sorry for her .  she is the most interesting character on the screen , who is forced into a world where she is not wanted .  something the devil's advocate contained actually shocked me for reasons other than extreme violence and nudity , especially for a film of this nature .  the story actually has something to say about humanity .  in one of the last scenes , john milton explains to kevin lomax the game god plays with his children ( he is satan , of course ) .  he comments that it is human nature to lust and loathe in vanity .  then , god sets up rules which contradict human nature .  this semi-religious bashing is more humorous than frightening .  what milton says is so true about our society that i found myself laughing out loud , partially thinking it was funny , but patially realizing it was true .  these moral dilemmas are present throughout the devil's advocate , giving it an added depth many films skip over in their writing ( but i'm sure they came straight from the novel it was based on ) .  when a film has something to say about our society , it deserves to be watched .  the cast of the devil's advocate is one of the highlights , as we see memorable faces , and they put spins on those memorable faces we don't expect .  heather matarazzo makes a brief appearance as the terrorized victim in the opening court case , and she does a great job .  probably the big surprise of this film is keanu reeves .  he has proven himself an uneven actor ( successes such as speed and bombs such as johnny mnemonic ) , but he tops himself with this performance .  i have never seen him more believable to date .  al pacino is of course the scene stealer .  his devilish performance is equal to those of jack nicholson ( the witches of eastwick ) and max von sydow ( needful things ) .  he could have easily gone too far over the top in many scenes , but he remains completely believable ( if that is the correct term ) .  jeffrey jones ( mostly known as the principal in ferris bueller's day off ) also gives a good performance as eddie barzoon .  judith ivey manages a credible performance as the mother who holds a secret to kevin's past .  connie nielson is very effective in her role , and she also appears naked several times .  one familiar face with a twist was "" coach "" star , craig t . nelson , who gives a very good performance .  the devil's advocate is rated r for sexuality , nudity , violence , language , and some gore .  at 144 minutes , this film moves along fairly quickly .  for the first two hours , i sat completely engaged in the good performances and strong characters .  the technical quality is also remarkable , with great special effects and a good musical score .  director taylor hackford has managed to create a very disturbing motion picture , only to ruin a good chunk of tension with the final fifteen minutes .  i guess my biggest problem with the ending is the fact that i went into the theater expecting a disturbing film , and hackford gave me just that for a long time .  but just before the end , he got jitterish and relied on the hollywood safety net in order to make his film more mainstream .  personally , i would have preferred it ending fifteen minutes early .

1|ingredients : down-on-his-luck evangelist , church  synopsis : sonny dewey ( robert duvall ) is a tireless texas pentecostal preacher who unexpectedly catches his wife ( farrah fawcett ) in bed with another guy .  in a regrettable crime of passion he takes a baseball bat to the guy's head , and suddenly finds himself a fugitive for murder , and estranged from his wife and two kids .  to atone for his sins , sonny flees to a rural bayou town in louisiana and baptizes himself as a new creature - - the apostle e . f . as the apostle e . f . sonny's main mission is to revive an abandoned church community and preach the gospel at the local radio station .  soon he sets about resurrecting the one way road to heaven holiness temple .  but sonny knows his time is short ; one day the police will find him .  opinion : this movie is a thought-provoking look at an evangelist in real life terms .  i believe that robert duvall ( who is the producer , director , writer , and main star of the apostle ) deserves an oscar for his performance as sonny the religious crusader - - a performance which is so complex and realistic it ranks as one of the finest acting performances on film .  duvall's portrayal of a true believer is authentic , superb , and inspired ; it offers the audience a completely honest look at southern religion , as well as a portrait of a fallible , complicated man driven by his beliefs .  incidentally , in real life duvall was just as 'driven' in getting the project underway .  since no major hollywood studio wanted to risk financing a complex movie about an evangelist , the apostle as a project lay dormant for almost 13 years before duvall was able to get it done , paying for its production with his own money ( about five million dollars ) .  in terms of hard-hitting realism and character portrayal the apostle would rank as one of the best movies of this decade , and i emphatically recommend the apostle for connoisseurs of stage and fine acting on film .  similarly , those with a steep background in pentecostal christianity would find the apostle a thought-provoking experience .  on the other hand , the apostle's main strength - - duvall's preaching - - is also what limits the apostle's target audience .  in terms of plot and pure entertainment value , the apostle is definitely not for everyone .  teenagers , action fans , comedy fans , and people who find church completely boring should stay far away from this movie , since three quarters of the film is watching sonny preach at church .  in other words , the apostle is a four star performance , but with a very limited audience .  |0.19533333333333336|0.8500000000000001|0.8166666666666668|"The movie ""The Apostle"" is described as thought-provoking, authentic, and superb with one of the finest acting performances on film by Robert Duvall. However, it is not recommended for everyone due to its limited target audience and lack of entertainment value for some viewers."
1|"the most amazing thing about paul cox's innocence is how unlike a movie it is .  i mean that as the highest compliment .  if most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i'd want to run and hide .  the sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence .  along with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable .  the romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles "" bud "" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby .  they decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair .  complicating matters is andreas' frail health , and claire's longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can't understand why he's suddenly become obsolete .  in my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved .  john , claire's husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong .  claire initially insists she's a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her .  andreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence .  cox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train .  it's a reminder of andreas and claire's past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed .  a pall is cast on the whole affair .  a master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments .  in andreas' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire's love .  we also get glimpses into john and claire's relationship .  during a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could .  all that's heard is the scraping of forks against plates .  the characters are unlike anything i've seen -- they're people .  so many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky .  or they're reduced to comedic buffoons .  ordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren't sure what the next step is .  they do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they've known throughout their adult lives .  bravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire's affair is automatically justified .  norris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire's love difficult to accept .  we feel for him .  he's a decent man .  sure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now .  with so much presented to the audience , it's only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does .  however , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn't likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon .
