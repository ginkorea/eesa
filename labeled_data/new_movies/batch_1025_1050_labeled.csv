0|"one might expect a cathartic viewing experience walking into a new jean-luc godard film .  after all , he was a founding member of the highly influential french new wave .  he is also an esteemed film critic , lending intelligence and historical perspective to us in much of his writing .  however , his latest creation , in praise of love , is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year .  the abstract concept on which the film is based had merit , to dissect love into the following four categories : meeting , physical passion , quarrels , and reconciliation .  these four universal truths would be revealed through three different couples : young , adult , and elderly .  it is edgar's ( bruno putzulu ) self-appointed task to capture these moments after a recent breakup , to define a central idea : "" it's only when things are over that they make sense . ""  whether this project will end up a play , film , or opera remains undecided .  the thesis is simple enough that , if played right , it could really hold sympathetic value for anyone .  instead what ensues is an hour and a half of repetitive vignettes , the next scene no more engaging than the last .  only once does any character utter something worthwhile , but by the time it happens you're so thoroughly bored you can easily miss it .  but don't fret , it will surface again .  you could easily sleep through whole sections of the film ( as some fellow critics did ) and wake up in a scene exactly like the one you nodded off in , not having missed anything worthwhile .  but you hold hope for some time .  the background music keeps you in a state of urgency , and even suspense , for the first few conversations .  it's only after repeated failures to pay any of this off that you lose all hope .  and with speeches like , "" i am thinking of something , but i can only think of that something when i am thinking of something else , "" how can you expect to hold anyone's interest ?  to godard's credit , he certainly knows how to frame a scene .  the black and white footage used for the first half of the film is starkly beautiful .  watching edgar read while walking along a train track on a mountain makes you wish you had something to ponder along with him .  and if this film had anything poignant to say , you would have , which makes you all the angrier at the numerous missed opportunities .  the environments , be it city or country , are impeccably captured in crisp detail , but the script never complements them .  unfortunately , godard also manages to pillage his photographic eye by randomly cutting to black numerous times within any given scene .  sometimes these breaks are used for chapter headings , but these are even more cryptic than the spoken words .  the second half is composed of nauseating hyper-color that often blurs the image .  you suddenly feel like a doomed character straight out of scanners .  the only scene that makes any sense is one that complains about the united states bastardizing history in the making of movies .  steven spielberg is picked on in particular .  while i'll grant that this does happen , and i tend to shy away from watching such garbage , it's still a pointless focus for a film that purports to articulate the specific qualities of couplehood .  it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller .  the days of breathless are no more .

0|"america loves convenience .  after all , we're the culture that invented the cell phone , the 24-hour atm , and my most beloved , the remote control .  yet perhaps this time , with ghosts of mars , we have taken our love of convenience to far .  ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails , pill-poppin' , martian cop , sent with her squadron to retrieve "" demolition "" williams ( ice cube ) from a remote mining town for trial back home .  when she and her comrades , appropriately dubbed "" the commander , "" "" the rookies , "" and the guy with the cool accent discover the town's residents slaughtered , they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents' head-chopping , alien-possessed clutches .  filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks , flashes-sideways , and viewpoint changes , ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill-conceived action sequences .  the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story .  ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie , ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next , stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose .  attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced .  most of these moments come off as kwik-e-mart wisdom , dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even-tempered streetwise hand of ice cube .  with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other , cube reminisces about his street life , comparing the zombie-stomping fun to "" me and my brother when we was kids . ""  apparently , crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment .  but , even in the film's darkest moments , fate conveniently lends a hand , supplying heavily armored transportation and easily accessible rifles and dynamite .  yes , in the future , man may travel to space and conquer mars , but nothing beats a good stick of tnt .  and as we all know , every police station , past , present , or future , keeps a healthy supply on hand .  characters die , heads are lopped off , but they were only supporting roles anyway , so why should we care ?  as long as you have plenty of narcotics , immunity is guaranteed .  eventually though , even the most well-trained zombie alien gets a bit uppity and needs to be taught a lesson .  what better way than by sacrificing a few minor characters to a convenient nuclear detonation , killing anything the machine guns can't handle .  explosions are fun .  and even if the nukes don't get them , the conveniently placed dynamite packs on the train stolen from the set of the road warrior certainly will .  in the end this film defines itself when our cop's tribunal pronounces , "" is that all you have to tell us ? ""  for , indeed , john carpenter has run out of things to say , and has instead decided to use whatever is convenient to tell a ridiculously bad story .

0|"reindeer games is easily the worst of the three recent films penned by ehren kruger ( scream 3 and arlington rd are the others , each derivative in their own special way ) .  the guy can't seem to write believable dialogue ( sample from reindeer games : "" rule #1 : never put a car thief behind the wheel "" ) , create multi-faceted characters , or even engineer coherent plots but he sure knows how to pile on numerous nonsensical twists and turns ( no matter if each one deems the actual story increasingly unlikely ) .  his screenplay for reindeer games turns the tables on the audience so many times that watching the film becomes something of a punishment with no reward anywhere in sight .  i can just envision kruger laughing behind his keyboard , "" oh you thought my movie was gonna go here , f * ck you jack ass , take that twist , decipher this mother f * cker ! ""  it's almost as if the writer were angry at us for shelling out money to see his stupid movie .  and why the hell would anyone want to invest time in a movie when the screenwriter keeps changing his own rules for no reason other than to congratulate himself on how damn clever he is ?  auteur theory be damned ; it's kruger's "" style "" , not the director's that winds up on screen .  kruger has obviously never paid much mind to the old chestnut "" sometimes less is more "" .  and his numerous twists can't even claim to be originals ; arlington rd's ending is a direct steal from the much better alan j . pakula thriller the parallax view , and in reindeer games we get this ol' gem ; character incriminates themself by saying something they shouldn't know ( pronouns used to protect the gender of the "" character "" . . . grammar  be damned ) .   "" how did you know that ? ""  the stunned protagonist asks , suddenly realizing that the character was in on the whole thing all along .   .   .  since twist endings are currently so in vogue , and seeing as how kruger's screenplays usually come equipped with about three twists per ending , i guess it's no wonder why he works so frequently .  he's quickly becoming miramax's mickey mouse ; the company has already signed him to work on several of their upcoming projects .  this is appropriate considering that miramax ( which used to place their label on some of the most artistically daring films ) has quickly become a grindhouse for coddling foreign imports ( life is beautiful ) and freddie prinze jr . vehicles .  their company's current logo could be "" we ride the trends "" .  reindeer games stars ben affleck as rudy , a supposedly hardened criminal spending his days and nights behind bars with fantasies of pecan pies dancing atop his head .  although affleck is given some barbed wire tattoos to insinuate bad assness , he plays the role like steve guttenberg preciously mugging through a police academy flick .  affleck is such a puppy dog that it's impossible to believe he could survive in a harsh prison environment without becoming nearly everyone's bitch .  the role itself is so badly written ( the character only grows balls when the plot calls for it ) , the twists so outrageous , and the directing so self consciously gritty that this is about as close to self parody as i can recall a recent "" serious "" movie getting .  it may have been wiser had the film makers simply went all the way in that direction , casting jerry seinfeld as the hardened criminal and howard stern as the sniveling bad guy ( who's played here by gary sinise in yet another over the top villain performance )  james frain is nick , rudy's cellmate , a manslaughterer who's found a pen pal in the gorgeous ashley mason ( charlize theron ) .  ashley is a prison groupie who sends nick many cheesecake photos of her though she's never seen one picture of him .  which works out fine since the character is killed in a near-riot , and rudy ( who was to be paroled on the same day as nick ) takes his place , which leads to a sudden and very frenzied sex scene between ashley and rudy ( so frenzied it kinda looks like rape ) and a surprise visit from ashley's brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) , who waltzes into their shabby hotel room flanked by his thuggish co-horts .  he plans to rob an indian casino on christmas eve with the assistance of rudy who he thinks is nick who , according to what he wrote in the letters to ashley , used to work as a guard in the indian casino .  though by the end , the film pulls the rug out from under us so frequently that everything i've described might as well be irrelevant .  this is what you can expect should you chose to take this reindeer on ; several scenes in which , after catching his prey , the bad guy proceeds to stall interminably until the good guy has a chance to kill his captor and crack a stupid one-liner .  included : two ( 2 ) scenes of two ( 2 ) different bad guys explaining their motives to the hero when they should be killing him ( one following the other no less ) .  though it's an action film , the ending is more a talkfest where we get the whole movie explained to us by one flustered character actor after another while affleck looks on , incredulous as the audience .  the flick was directed by john frankenheimer , a straightforward action director who lucked into the manchurian candidate early in his career , fell off the a-list following a string of flops and now , in his old age , is slowly climbing his way back up .  it would be a success story if he were choosing better scripts but his last major film was ronin ( one of those almost but not quite movies ) which followed the island of dr . morneau   ( you remember , the one with marlon brando in mime make-up and a not so flattering moo-moo ) , and now this .  he films action sequences with a minimum of quick cutting which i like considering that nowadays action scenes are commonly comprised of millisecond flash cuts strung together and laid out for a brain-zapped mtv audience to pick apart .  problem is these action scenes ( nearly all failed escapes ) serve no purpose in the story other than to further pad out the running time and to remind the audience that their watching an action movie rather than a filmed radio play .  character problems abound ; rudy is made to shift between sweet boy next door earnestness and hard edged wiseacre , the latter of which is not ( at least at this point ) something ben affleck is capable of pulling off .  the former he can do with ease and often the actor coasts on his lackadaisical charm while those around him growl and swear .  but then suddenly affleck starts growling and swearing alongside them like the class clown imitating a tarantino gangster .  charlize theron , an extraordinary talent , is , like affleck , playing whatever part the script requires her to play , whether it be vulnerability at one moment , anger at the next .  she never has a chance to evince any charm or make much of an impression beyond her obvious physical attributes ( frankenheimer has her needlessly pop her top to further italicize this .  gary sinise has played this role frequently , and here , as in snake eyes , he does the snarling bad guy thing with such over the top vitriol ( the guy must be so incredibly bored of stomping through the same paces that going out of control is the only thing that keeps him interested any more ) , that it becomes more of an annoyance ( oh there he goes again ? ? ? ) than a threat .  these are talented people who made the mistake of jumping on to a script with little but stock characters and a bag of tricks that it dully springs on its audience .

0|"a follow-up to disney's live-action "" 101 dalmatians "" that's better , more entertaining than the first ?  just as unlikely .  with "" 102 dalmatians , "" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier .  1996's "" 101 dalmatians "" certainly wasn't the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance .  in addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies .  this time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close's facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers .  but that's only half the problem with kevin lima's laborious film .  what makes "" 102 dalmatians "" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he's a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic "" heroes "" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? .  gruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can't even aspire to that .  the dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close's split ends are more animated .  bad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro's in "" men of honor . ""  jean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu's over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail .  france's most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in "" 102 dalmatians "" the producers milk that realization for all it's worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as "" poopies , "" par example ( and ad nauseum ) .  the finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) .  that done , it's back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown .  the dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that's pretty much all they are .  there's always the feeling that there's a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder .  savvy holiday goers should skip "" 102 dalmatians "" and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead .  it's one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying .

0|"play it to the bone , the newest addition to ron shelton's sports - themed repertoire fails in numerous ways .  like most of shelton's other great films ( bull durham , white men can't jump ) , this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots .  shelton's films are not considered sports films , but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story .  shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions .  play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull , but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse .  the film has no social message like its predecessors .  the relationship between the friends , two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars , is very confusing for a number of reasons .  the whole film , since it is primarily a "" buddy picture , "" depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other .  unfortunately , it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below .  1 ) we never see how cesar ( antonio banderas ) and vince ( woody harrelson ) meet .  the two are so different from each other , that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory .  2 ) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas .  there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something .  3 ) the third character on the trip , grace ( lolita davidovich ) stands in the way .  she is in nearly every scene with them , making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other .  4 ) there are two many interfering , irrelevant side stories .  vince is convinced that he sees jesus on a regular basis , cesar yells at the sky in spanish when he is angry , and grace tries to sell her inventions to hotel owner robert wagner .  these boring tales only hurt the central plot .  5 ) when it comes to time for the two men to fight , they don't even hesitate to pound each other .  wasn't the whole point of the road trip to show that these two are friends who could never hurt each other ?  by the time the road trip part of the movie is over with , the film wants to be over .  shelton , on the other hand , continues to tell his story .  forty five painful minutes remain .  the boxing scene between cesar and vince starts out very powerful and interestingly different from other boxing movies .  however , the fight goes on for way too long and becomes very repetitive and predictable after awhile , kind of like the whole film .

0|"some movies i should just skip .  my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program .  true , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it's a cartoon .  but it's a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen .  but my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ?  turns out i was right , mostly .  inspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick .  at first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver .  this odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where "" formula "" isn't just business , it's a way of life .  the producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits .  in some parts you can just hear them saying "" more zany !  i want more zany here -- and -- here .

0|"hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell .  the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films .  in a nutshell , the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous .  with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership , a lot of hong kong's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u . s . productions .  such talents as jackie chan ( rush hour ) , chow yun-fat ( anna & the king , the corrupter ) and yuen woo-ping ( the matrix ) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results .  now we can add two other hong kong filmmakers to the mix with star jet li and director and fight choreographer corey yuen kwai .  unfortunately "" romeo must die "" bears all the trademarks of a typical hollywood action film and none of hong kong's rhythms .  the film opens in a nightclub as an asian couple is necking .  enter a group of chinese gangsters led by kai sing ( russell wong ) .  kai confronts po sing ( jon kit lee ) , the son of kai's boss and leader of the local chinese family .  a battle breaks out between the bodyguards of the club and kai , who handily kicks and punches his opponents down .  it's not until club owner silk ( rapper dmx ) , bears down on kai and his henchmen that the fight ends .  the following morning po sing is found dead .  suspicions escalate , as issac o'day ( delroy lindo ) is told of the murder .  his concern that the war between his and the chinese family may explode and ruin his plans to move out of the business of corruption and into a legitimate venture .  issac implores his chief of security , mac ( issiah washington ) to watch after his son and daughter .  the scene shifts to a prison in china , where han sing ( jet li ) learns of his brothers murder .  he fights with the guards and is dragged off to be disciplined .  hung upside down by one foot , han recovers and battle his way out of custody in a blistering display of fight choreography and stunt work .  escaping to the u . s . han sets out to find the person responsible for his brother's death .   "" romeo must die "" is in many ways a fun film .  it is both absurd and assured .  the basic plot of a gangster wanting to become legitimate echoes "" the godfather "" .  the relationship between jet li's han and aaliyah's trish o'day reminds us of abel ferrera's "" china girl "" , except that romeo must die's couple never once exchange more than a loving glance towards one another .  their romance is much more puritanical than any other romance in film history .  the performances are adequate if not fully acceptable .  li , of course has the showiest part , having to express both an innocents and steadfast determination .  allayah , in her feature film debut manages to carry what little is asked of her with a certain style and grace .  it's obvious that the camera loves her and she is very photogenic .  but , still the part is under written in such a way that even a poor performance would not have affected it .  delro lindo as issac o'day carries himself well in the film .  an unsung and under appreciated actor , mr . lindo turns out the films best performance .  the other performers are all adequate in what the script asks of them except for d . b . woodside as issac's son , colin .  the performance is undirected , with the character changing his tone and demeanor in accordance with whatever location he is in .  an unfocused performance that should have been reigned in and / or better written .  first time director andrzej bartkowiak does a workmanlike job in handling the film .  having a career as one of the industry's best cinematographers , bartkiwiak knows how to set up his shots , and "" romeo must die "" does look good .  but the pacing of the film is lethargic , only coming to a semblance of life during the fight scenes .  the script by eric bernt and john jarrell is not focused in such a way that we can care about the characters or the situations they are in .  the big gambit of buying up waterfront property to facilitate the building of a sports center for a nfl team is needlessly confusing .  and of course the common practice of one character being the comic relief of the film becomes painfully obvious here as anthony anderson as allayah's bodyguard , maurice has no comic timing whatsoever .  the best things about the film are its fight scenes .  jet li is a master of these intricate physical battles .  one needs only to see his film "" fist of legend "" to understand that the man is without peer in the realm of martial art combat .  here , jet is given the opportunity to show off in a way that "" lethal weapon 4 "" ( jet's u . s . debut ) didn't allow .  unfortunately , a lot of jet's fights are aided with computer effects that detract from his ability and precision .  also "" romeo must die "" must be noted as having the most singularly useless effect ever committed to film , and that is an x-ray effect that appears three times during the course of the film , showing the effect of bone crushing blows on an opponent .  obviously a homage to the famed x-ray scene from sonny chiba's "" streetfighter "" , the scenes here are just pointless and interfere with the pacing of the film .  it's as if the film has stopped and a video game has been inserted .  one problem though about the fight scenes .  those that are familiar with hong kong action know that even though the films are fantasies and are as removed from reality as any anime or cartoon .  they do have an internal rhythm to them .  a heartbeat , so to speak in their choreography .  the fight scenes in a hong kong film breath with an emotional resonance .  this is created by the performance , the direction and the editing .  here in "" romeo must die "" , there is no staccato .  every fight scene , even though technically adroit and amazing becomes boring as the editing both cuts away from battle at hand and simple follows a set pattern .  the rhythm is monotonous .  a hong kong film has a tempo that changes , heightening its emotional impact .  'rmd' is limited to a standard 4/4 tempo , not allowing for any emotional content whatsoever .  a fine example of this difference can be found by examining a couple of jackie chan's films . .  watch the restaurant fight from the film "" rush hour "" and notice that the context of the fight , while technically amazing is rather flat ( the framing and cut always do not help ) .  now look at the warehouse fight from "" rumble in the bronx "" .  there you have a heartbeat , and emotional draw that doesn't let the audience catch its breath .  the stops and pauses for dramatic effect work perfectly , causing the viewer to be both astounded and flabbergasted .  here in 'romeo must die' , the fight scenes have no more emotional content or character than any john wayne barroom brawl .  jet li is a grand and personable screen presence .  it's a shame that his full talents were not used to full effect here .  one day filmmakers here in the u . s . will stop making films by the numbers and start to embrace the style and emotion that has made hong kong action pictures such a commodity .  until then , we'll be left with emotionally hollow product like "" the replacement killer "" and , currently "" romeo must die "" .

0|out of sight director steven sorderbergh baffles the hell out of us all in the limey , a cold , uninvolving , confusing new thriller .  though the plot description may at first seem like it came from the pen of elmore leonard ( author of out of sight , as well as jackie brown , get shorty and pulp fiction ) , after you watch it , you realize that it's not nearly good enough .  in an aggressively non-linear fashion , the limey ( li * mey , noun : an english gentleman ) tells the story of wilson ( terrence stamp ) , a british ex-con just released from a 9 year stint in prison for armed robbery .  he has come to the us to seek vengeance for the death of his daughter jenny .  he doesn't know much about the circumstances of her demise , all he has is a name : terry valentine .  valentine was jenny's former boyfriend , a wealthy and corrupt record executive .  he's played by peter fonda , in his first major role since the terrific ulee's gold in 1997 .  seeking valentine's reclusive place of residence turns out to be no easy task for wilson .  he finally finds the impressive abode high in the mountains and sneaks in just as valentine is having a big party .  he winds up breaking his cover eventually , setting off valentine's head of security and valentine himself , who decides to run for it .  what a mess .  i have no problem when films refuse to be constricted by the linearity of time -- pulp fiction , which twisted time every which way , was a masterpiece -- but i do take exception to movies that decide to play around with it for no reason other than to confuse the viewer .  the limey does exactly that .  the plot is permeated with flashbacks , flash-forwards and what can only be described as random time-travel , without any evident purpose .  there is no method to this movie's madness .  it uses a fancy way to tell a story that would be better off told more conventionally and more comprehendably .  the plot isn't particularly interesting in the first place : traditional , mildly hackneyed and not very involving .  this is a sort of brooding film -- our protagonist doesn't speak much and the action sequences are done with an annoyingly perfunctory attitude .  i felt like the director wasn't very interested in the proceedings himself , almost like he made this film for a paycheck .  ditto for the editing , which seems to be deliberately sloppy and unpleasant .  sixties icon terrence stamp manages to at least be menacing as the aging criminal .  he's not much in the way of stature but he has a surprisingly imposing physical presence that works to his advantage here .  peter fonda is an unbelievably underrated actor : he's shy , quiet but always effective .  he's adept at conveying emotions through speech rather than expression : his feelings don't always show on his face by you can always tell what they are .  this is basically a conventional thriller told in a pretentiously bizarre fashion .  why soderbergh couldn't just parrot down and tell a story , i don't know , but what he does do certainly doesn't work .  the result is a wild cornucopia of images that amount to precisely nil -- even the action scenes don't work .  1999 may have signified the death of the traditional act one - act two - act three storyline , but obviously some movies have not yet transcended it .  shall we go back to basics ?  |-0.8000000000000002|0.9|0.8000000000000002|The summary explanation is that the sentiment towards the movie is negative due to criticisms of the director's vision and execution, including the film being cold, confusing, and not good enough.

0|"all through its production and into the early days of its initial , aborted pre-release publicity , hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood .  ultimately , however , paramount pictures , nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996's other , underperforming disaster films ( dante's peak , volcano ) , changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year .  but , to paraphrase the bard , swill , by any other name , would smell as rank .  no number of name changes can help this picture .  it's not just about a disaster , it is a disaster .  hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute .  the best shot occurs during the opening credits , as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg , indiana as the water level slowly rises .  the community , protected by an overworked dam , is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud-choked skies .  from that moment on , it's all downhill .  whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point .  it takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest-seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured .  basically , hard rain is one extended , dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot-outs .  there's a lot of water , broken glass , gunfire , and explosions .  it's all very routine and uninteresting because there aren't any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense .  the film's conclusion is so preposterous that it's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around .  action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion .  graham yost , the writer of both speed and hard rain , surely understands that principle .  unfortunately , neither he , nor cinematographer-turned-director mikael salomon ( a far off place ) , applies it .  the action in hard rain grows tedious through repetition .  we see the same kinds of things -- speedboat chases , flood damage , shoot-outs , etc . -- over and over again .  the movie constantly recycles about twenty minutes worth of material to pad the running time out to an acceptable movie length .  the storyline gives us a number of paper-thin characters in contrived circumstances .  there's tom ( christian slater ) , the one- dimensional action hero who works as a security guard driving an armored car full of cash .  he and his partner , charlie ( edward asner , tv's "" lou grant "" ) , get stuck on a street that's rapidly turning into a river .  a group of men , led by jimmy ( morgan freeman ) , arrive on the scene not as rescuers but as robbers .  after charlie is killed in a shoot-out , tom hides the money , then runs .  as he swims and boats his way through huntingburg's roads , he encounters some of the locals : karen ( minnie driver ) , a would-be love interest ; a bickering old couple ( richard dysart and betty white ) , who are on hand to provide comic relief ; and the easily-corrupted sheriff ( randy quaid ) , whose seeming helpfulness hides sinister ulterior motives .  there isn't any real acting in this film .  christian slater utters a few lame one-liners and does a lot of mugging for the camera .  tom is easily one of the most lifeless characters the actor has brought to the screen .  randy quaid sneers a lot , and is totally unconvincing .  morgan freeman and minnie driver both attempt to give legitimate performances , but they are defeated by the script .  freeman , one of the best cinematic thespians working today , looks suitably embarrassed to be here , but i suppose everyone needs a good paycheck from time-to-time .  following in the wake of twister , this is yet another natural disaster movie that doesn't trust nature's fury as the chief engine of conflict .  as a result , we are saddled with an idiotic good guys/bad guys story that effectively ruins any potential that the flood tale could have had .  titanic proved that there can be a wealth of drama in a movie where everything goes under water .  hard rain successfully demonstrates that the opposite is equally possible .  thus far this year , hollywood has already subjected us to its unique brand of moronic mayhem by fire ( firestorm ) and water ( hard rain ) .  fortunately , there are only two elements left .

0|"instinct is the kind of movie that inexperienced moviegoers will undoubtedly label as "" powerful "" or "" touching "" .  i have a name for it myself : "" gross "" .  this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully , the bully looks at the "" rebel "" threateningly , about to hurt him , and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too .  how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me : aren't present day moviegoers beyond being "" inspired "" by something like that ?  this is one example ( there are actually some more in instinct alone ) of filmmakers insulting the audience's intelligence .  instinct's plot is brimming with potential : world-renowned anthropologist ethan powell ( anthony hopkins ) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa .  he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer ; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him .  after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport , the authorities stick him in a prison's "" psychotics ward "" .  assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright ( or so we are told ) young psychiatrist theo caulder ( cuba gooding jr . ) .  caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career .  of course ( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way ) he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison .  and then there's the inevitable "" heartless meanie "" character , in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder's mentor .  he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell .  let's get one thing straight : dr . theo caulder is the most blatantly incompetent psychiatrist i have ever seen , on screen or off .  any good shrink will listen to what his patient has to say no matter the subject because any good shrink will learn a great deal about his patient that way .  not good old theo .  no , he asks purposefully pointed questions and when powell dares to venture to another subject caulder says "" we need to talk about this right now . ""  this is a flaw only in the sense that it detracts from instinct's already dubious credibility ; unfortunately it's also the least of its problems .  director jon turteltaub , who made the delightful john travolta vehicle phenomenon as well as the surprisingly above-par cool runnings decided to make this movie so shamelessly sentimental that , contrary to what this movie's promotion would have you believe , it has much more in common with patch adams than with the silence of the lambs .  it's not the kind of sentimentality that can almost bring tears to your eyes ( what dreams may come aptly demonstrated that ) but the kind that brings vomit up your esophagus ( excuse the graphic depiction ) .  it aims to "" inspire "" rather than to touch hearts .  as yoda would say , inspire it does not .  it is the ultimate sign of futility when a screenwriter ( the very experienced gerald di pego ) has to resort to literally telling the audience a movie's story .  indeed , somewhere in the beginning of instinct , one of the characters actually reads aloud the film's plot to another character .  this , like the instance i mentioned in the first paragraph of this review , is a horrid insult to our intelligence .  i am forced to wonder whether turteltaub and di pego did not think that we could figure out what instinct is about simply from regular conversation .  i think that anthony hopkins is one of the greatest screen actors , and he chews the scenery in this movie , brilliant as ever .  oscar winner cuba gooding jr . on the other hand is dreadful .  his performance is at least part of what makes his character seem so incapable of being a shrink .  i liked the guy in jerry maguire as well as in as good as it gets but here he fails to project any shred of credibility or real feeling .  i love animals , and instinct's prominent save the gorillas/live in harmony with nature theme is certainly something i could sympathize with .  however this movie's execution is completely unacceptable .  tone down the violence and this will be a chick flick .   ? 1999 eugene novikov  "|-0.8500000000000001|0.8166666666666668|0.7833333333333333|The reviewers express strong dissatisfaction with the movie's plot, characters, sentimentality, and insult to the audience's intelligence, using negative language and criticizing the director, screenwriter, and Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance.

""  ho ho ho .  1900 grows up never setting foot on dry land .  when he's about 30ish and can play the piano like nobody's business , onboard comes another musician .  his name is max ( pruitt taylor vince ) and he plays the trumpet .  after 1900 catches max barfing everywhere during a storm , he sits him down on the piano next to him , takes the piano's braces off and plays while the piano flies all around the hall , taking them with it .  how the chair they're sitting on and the piano don't separate , i don't know , but this apparently isn't the kind of thing we're supposed to ask .  after that , 1900 and max become friends .  max is determined to get 1900 off the ship and discover what he is missing on land , but 1900 has no intention of doing so .  what's more , he doesn't even want his music to go anywhere without him : when a record company hears about his talents , they come on board to make a record of his music , but after finding out that -- gasp !  -- they're going to make millions of copies , he breaks the record .  the conflict of the movie is that after max , unsuccessful in his endeavor to get 1900 off the ship , gets off himself , he stumbles upon a record of 1900's music in a store .  the record shouldn't exist because a ) 1900 never stepped on dry land and b ) the one record that was made on the ship was broken .  ladies and gentlemen , it's a mystery !  the story itself is ludicrous and uninteresting and so are its elements .  we're supposed to be roused by a climactic . . .  piano duel ?  there isn't anything in this movie with the potential to compel .  1900 comes off as a whiny , brooding , extremely unlikable man : i can't recall a single word he said that was not some sort of depressing pseudo- meditation on life .  ditto for max , who doesn't seem to have a life outside his friendship with 1900 .  tim roth plays 1900 with about as much panache as a fig leaf ; there's no spirit , no gusto to the character .  he insists that he leads a happy life on the ship , but to us he is dead .  pruitt taylor vince is a little more palatable , at least providing a moment of comic relief here and there to liven things up a bit .  the highlight of the movie would have to be the eminently amusing clarence williams the iii as the arrogant , leering "" king of jazz "" who challenges 1900 to the aforementioned piano duel .  the legend of 1900 was made by giuseppe tornatore , whose 1988 cinema paradiso is considered a masterpiece by many .  this effort is utterly limp and lifeless .  at once ridiculous , boring , narrow-sighted and pointless , this is one movie that should be -- and will be -- quickly forgotten .
