1|synopsis : upper middle class , suburban family man lester ( kevin spacey ) realizes that he is just going through the motions : he is unable to feel passion ; he is soulless , cynical , and no longer able to feel the edge between success and failure .  everyone else around him has similar symptoms .  lester's unassertive daughter jane ( thora birch ) is too lethargic to change her world , yet all too ready to whine and complain .  his wife carolyn ( annette bening ) is reduced to keeping up appearances and reciting commercialist slogans .  and these are people with a big house and a decent standard of living .  the only person who seems able to appreciate beauty and freedom and life is the person most deprived of it : a dope-dealing teen from across the street who is practically imprisoned by a domineering , bullying father .  when lester embarks on a mad scramble to feel the edge again , the fact that he has quit his job to feel what it's like - - and his newfound interest in exercise to impress a teenage girl - - ruffle a lot of feathers in the family .  will lester regain his ability to appreciate life ?  opinion : people say it all the time : you never appreciate good health until it's gone .  likewise , people raised in fabulously pampered prosperity can become unhappy and spiteful over the dumbest , most inconsequential problems , simply because they have no clue how good they have it .  sometimes it takes a near fall - - accidentally or through deliberate fasting - - to move out of apathy and reclaim your ability to challenge the world .  the deprivation/appreciation cycle is a major theme of american beauty .  american beauty is a non-formula , intelligent and articulate movie that offers fantastic performances by everyone in the cast , especially kevin spacey , who is simply gosh darn amazing this movie .  the thing i like about american beauty is that there is no sentimental music , no hospital scene nor any overly dramatic hokum .  the movie entertains and offers brilliant performances just as is .  if you are in the mood for a thoughtful , non-formula flick , i highly recommend american beauty .  |0.75|0.8999999999999999|0.9|"The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive as they highlight the appreciation for life, the brilliant performances in the movie ""American Beauty,"" and the recommendation of the movie to others.

1|"though it is a fine piece of filmmaking , there's something about elizabeth . . . that  left me a bit cold , and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films , particularly these days ; i just didn't care about the characters .  to me , the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters ( be they imagined or historical as the case may be ) that the audience gives a hoot about .  and though elizabeth works well on many levels , it falls short of excellence because of that very reason .  elizabeth takes place in england in 1554 , as queen mary , half sister of elizabeth and a monarch on the side of catholicism is dying .  before she dies , though , she cannot bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs .  as a result , amidst much anger within the council , elizabeth becomes the queen of england .  the film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of england and tries to bring order to her personal and political life .  much of the film deals with elizabeth's love for lord robert , a mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen .  there is much ado about her lack of a husband , and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation .  the problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece , as love interests are such a character driven element .  i didn't much care about the characters ( perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett ) and so i didn't have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials .  the cast is rounded out well with the marvelous rush who plays the queen's most loyal advisor , sir francis , and attenborough as a well-meaning but old-fashioned lead council .  why then , you must be asking , do i recommend elizabeth ?  simply because it is the result of a perfect pairing of director and cinematographer .  kapur and his cinematographer remi adefarasin ( neither of whom i have heard ) create a beautifully realized piece of filmmkaing from the technical side .  the light streams through each frame as in any painting from the period and beautifully captures the realistic light sources that would have been found in churches , cellars and castles in 16th century europe .  each frame is rich with color contrasted with blackness or blown-out white light from windows .  the costumes by alexandra byrne deserve a mention as they are such an inportant aspect of each shot .  indeed , elizabeth is one of the most visually beautiful films of the decade , ranking with kundun and braveheart .  watch also for the incredibly "" godfather-esque "" mass murder scene .  it made me think in retrospect of the similarities between the two films .

1|"carolco pictures and dutch director paul verhoeven ( robocop ) came together to create the 1990 mega hit that is total recall .  the film is a masterpiece of sets , action , and special effects .  action and science fiction just don't get any better than this !  the story involves a construction worker named douglas quaid ( arnold schwarzenegger ) who lives on earth with his beautiful wife lori ( sharon stone ) .  quaid is obsessed with mars and decides to go with the second best choice ; a brain implant ( fake memory ) of a two week vacation on mars .  while being implanted a memory cap is triggered and the doctors realize that quaid's memory has previously been erased .  now the people who did it are after him .  quaid must find out who he really is and why these people want him dead .  the plot unfolds at a rapid pace explaining itself through great action , special effects , and twist after mind-boggling twist .  it grabs you and never lets go !  this film is a winner from beginning to end .  the plot is superb ; combining the best elements of science fiction and psychological mystery to create a rip-roaring saga .  schwarzenegger gives his best performance ever , and the supporting cast is good too .  the action and stunts are terrific .  the sets are huge and elaborate with a lot of attention payed to detail .  the music and sound effects are perfect for the film and really add a certain level of impact to the action .  the make-up effects by rob bottin ( the howling , the thing , and robocop ) are top notch , not to mention extremely outlandish .  the visual effects by dream quest ( the abyss ) and industrial light and magic ( star wars trilogy , jurassic park , and terminator 2 ) are phenomenal !  the visuals had such a state of the art "" slickness "" that they won an oscar .  of course the film isn't always realistic ; it's more fiction than science .  for example , it is true that a body won't explode in the vacuum of space but in total recall they do .  who cares ?  it's a movie .  movies are supposed to entertain .  and in my opinion this film achieves an entertainment level in film that is so terrific , it may be impossible to beat .

1|"with the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late '90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically .  for the former , you need look no further than director tom tykwer's incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards .  lola , a contemporary goth-girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day .  it seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he doesn't deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed .  this gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies .  so she runs -- not just jogs , sprints -- in hopes that somehow , someway , she'll be able to obtain the money and save a life .  >from there , as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like "" sliding doors on steroids .  with a non-stop techno soundtrack , wierd camerawork , all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace , anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something .  indeed , the movie is often outrageously exciting , as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious .  very much like titanic , run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film .  the way the movie is made , for pure visual style , tykwer's movie is breathtaking ( literally , sometimes ) .  thematically it does leave something to be desired ; it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash .  while you are watching , this will not matter .  running a breezy 81 minutes , this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted .  it is the equivalent of a roller-coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  "|-0.18333333333333335|0.75|0.7666666666666666|"The explanations suggest that the sentiment towards the movie ""Run Lola Run"" is mixed, with mentions of positive elements such as excitement and visual style, but also criticisms of the lack of substance and desire for it to be longer.

1|"i was anxious to see this for a long time .  a friend of mine recommended this to me because he has a crush on neve campbell , and he wanted to prove that she's as hot as he thinks he is .  he proved it for me all right , but the reasons i enjoy this film go way beyond that .  scream treads on familar ground , horror movie with , as star neve campbell puts it , "" some stupid killer stalking some big breasted girl who can't act who's always running up the stairs when she should be running out the front door . ""  it's very familar , your typical horror film .  so why , you may ask after watching it , does it seem so new and original ?  because it treats itself as if it hasn't been done before , and thus the viewer is disilusioned into believing that it is not old , familar tired stuff .  this raises another question : how does it do this ?  simple : the characters .  they're not your typical stupid horror film victims who don't know what the hell to do when being chased by a guy in a ski mask and a machette .  they are horror fans , they know how stuff happens in a horror movie , they know what to do and what not to do , and that makes it scary , and even funny at certain times .  you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker ( drew barrymore ) is making popcorn , getting ready to watch a video , and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that , if she gets it wrong , will get her and her boyfriend killed .  she knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions , she just can't answer his final question , "" what door am i at ? ""  and that gets her killed .  that scene works because in a normal horror film , half the things that happen in that scene would never happen .  the plot is typical horror stuff : sidney prescott ( an impressive neve campbell ) , an attractive young high school student who's mother was killed a year ago tommorrow , is being stalked by a killer who's previously murdered one of her classmates ( casey , naturally ) , and everybody in this small , california town is a suspect , including sidney's boyfriend , billy loomis .  but as i said before , these people know how horror movies work , and that's what makes it so appealing .  that and the references to horror movies , like when casey says , "" the first ( nightmare on elm street ) was scary , but the rest sucked . ""  which is obviously director wes craven ( who does a good job of poking fun of the genre that made him a legend ) patting himself on the back as he directed the first nightmare movie and none of the others , and when tatum , sidney's friend , mentions the director , wes carpenter , which is obviously an homage by writer kevin williamson to not only craven , but also director john carpenter .  the cast is well chosen , neve campbell pulls off a good heroine ( and unlike most horror film heroines , she * can * act ) , drew barrymore does a good janet leigh impression for what little time she has in the film , and david arquette is impressive .  also good ( and funny ) in his role is henry winkler ( "" the fonz "" ) as the school principal .  i took half a point off for the unnecessary ( albeit limited ) appearance by friends' courteney cox as reporter , gail edwards , sidney's rival because she covered her mother's disappearance .  i hate that show , i hate those actors .  they're untalented , overexposed , and overpaid , imho , and i would think wes craven is smart enough to know those actors are overexposed enough , but i suppose he isn't .

1|to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie , mulan is a whole new world .  the mouse factory's latest feature is a treasure , featuring magnificent animation , a strong story and finely drawn characters .  mulan is the story of a fiesty , head-strong young woman who , unlike other disney heroines , isn't seeking her prince charming ,  mulan's motivations are simple ; to save her father , serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say .  the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation .  the emperor has called for a conscription , one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation .  mulan's crippled father is called , but mulan sneaks off , steals his armor and takes his place .  mulan is a saga of courage and self-discovery .  yet , despite the grim backdrop of war , it is a lively tale of self-reliance and brain-over-brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy .  the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian-american talent as the voices for the main characters , including the wonderful ming-na wen ( the joy luck club ) as mulan , b . d .  wong as shang , mulan's commanding officer and later love interest , pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon-tek oh as mulan's proud , but loving father .  also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon , sent by mulan's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman .  his fast , wise-cracking , hip-talking mushu may seem out of place , but it's a crowd pleasing performance , especially for the youngsters .  the movie features only a couple of songs , fewer than most previous disney animated flicks , but mulan's are winners .  the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot .  the overall score by jerry goldsmith also is a plus .  mulan is a treat , more powerful than hercules , with more heart than the hunchback of notre dame .  at about 85 minutes , mulan moves rapidly , and will hold the attention of youngsters from beginning to the end .  mulan will set a new standard by which future animated efforts by disney and other studios will have to work hard to attain .  also , it is hoped that the success of mulan , and there is no doubt that it will prove to be a popular vehicle , will spur an interest for more movies with oriential or asian-american themes so as to provide more substantial roles for the talented performers who gave their voices for this production .  it would be nice to see them on screen as well as hear them .  committed to lifelong learning through effective communication  |0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.9333333333333332|"The summary explanation of the provided explanations is that ""Mulan"" is praised for its magnificent animation, strong story, and finely drawn characters, as well as its themes of bravery and self-discovery.

1|"as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot , mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences .  you know the type : his shirt is always shredded , his face always scarred , he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a "" to kill "" list for his enemies .  oscar-hungry director/executive producer roland emmerich did not intend to , but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century .  as gibson delivers lines like , "" before this war is over , i am going to kill you , "" schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind .  oddly enough , the patriot is as much an epic three-hour-tear-fest like gladiator , as it is a ninety-minute guilty pleasure .  at times absorbing , at others enjoyably insipid , this is good , bloody summer fun .  i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend .  some of the images are so zealously americanized ( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example ) , that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it .  like emmerich's id4 , this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all .  sure it's predictable and melodramatic , but for a moment after leaving the theater , i was dumbfounded with patriotism .  and isn't that the point of the patriot ?  gibson plays benjamin martin , the lionized french and indian war veteran , who , at the beginning of the film , is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away .  he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants ( not slaves ! ) .  as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away , martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields .  but when the oldest son enlists anyway and another is murdered by a wicked redcoat colonel ( jason isaacs ) , martin quickly decides to save the day ( or save the fate of america as presented by emmerich ) .  forming a band of aggressive farmers and using guerilla tactics considered unfair in the art of war , martin becomes the number one target of the british army .  the best parts of the patriot are the scenes in which martin and his rugged militia men outsmart the british armies left and right .  every time the farmers attacked the unsuspecting enemy , to see the disbelief on british general cornwallis' ( tom wilkinson ) face was priceless entertainment .  and as the tension gradually formulates with the running time , a final battle is inevitable .  as for the numerous battle scenes , they are expertly done .  clearer and more realistic than those of gladiator , the gruesome images are what give this film an r rating .  you really get a sense of how warfare was performed during that time period .  everything is performed in an orderly ( but still quite gory ) fashion - one side shoots , then the other side , then the remaining soldiers charge .  it's organized , strategic and , according to martin , ineffective .  there is a very interesting contrast between the traditional battle style and martin's take-no-prisoners method .  what drives martin to these supposedly unfair actions , are the originally brutal tactics of colonel tavington .  played wonderfully by jason isaacs , tavington is the type who loves to glare down from his horse at civilians , who nervously avoid eye contact .  this character is viciously evil ; he kills women and children and then laughs about it on the way home ; even his eyes are evil .  his portrayal has sparked some controversy in britain , some claim that he falsely represents his countrymen as "" cowardly "" and "" sadistic . ""  i disagree with this accusation .  tavington does not represent his country ; his unnecessary executions shock his own colleagues and even anger his general .  besides tavington , the redcoats remain stick figures that are neither glorified nor patronized .  and stick figures make the easiest enemies in these kinds of movies - why give the audience a reason to love the bad guys ?  heck , why not spend the entire film glossing up the good guys ?  the patriot is three hours of fictional fireworks .  with an action hero seeking revenge and a comic book villain ready to take him down , it's a lethal weapon for the colonial times .  god bless america !  and god bless the patriot !

1|" "" if there's a beast in men , it meets its match in women , too . ""  starring sarah patterson , angela lansbury , tusse silberg , david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter , from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus  in recent years , there has been a trend in the field of fantasy : writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world , investing it with new life and energy .  in modern times , fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased ; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches , friendly dwarves , and cuddly talking animals .  but in their original forms , fairy tales have a dark , wicked edge .  crows tear out the eyes of cinderella's sisters , a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version .  hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven .  writers have become fascinated by the bloodier , morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales , and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots .  before this trend was in vogue , angela carter--whose stories always have a dark , wicked , subversive edge--had been reinventing fairy tales for years .  in the company of wolves , she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood , enlivening it with werewolves , rolls royces , and a visit from satan .  the story is structured as a dream , occurring in the mind of rosaleen ( sarah patterson ) , an adolescent girl about whose 'real' life we learn very little .  within the dream , there are a number of inset stories , most told by dream-rosaleen's grandmother ( angela lansbury ) , and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing , suggestive ways .  the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister , contemporary fairy tale .  i say "" surprisingly "" because there are so many ways this film could have gone wrong .  and there are ways in which it does .  the performances are mediocre , except for lansbury's--she finds the right note for the prim , apple-cheeked granny , the wise and stern teller of cautionary tales .  the soundtrack , synth-heavy , reminded me of bad 80s horror movies , as did the special effects in the shapechanging scenes .  probably state-of-the-art at the time , they are now laughable .  but jordan succeeds at what i consider the trickiest aspect of the film : he transcends the poor acting/music/effects and conveys a sense of the fantastic , of otherness .  one of the problems in adapting full-blown fantasies is that fantasy is often best left to the imagination of the reader , rather than being subjected to the 'realism' of the screen .  part of me would love to see an adaptation of 'the lord of the rings , ' but , on the other hand , i know that any filmmaker's recreation of ents , hobbits , and balrogs is inevitably going to be really lame compared to what i picture in my mind .  this makes jordan's accomplishment here seem mighty impressive to me : he imbues the company of wolves with a genuine sense of magic and mystery .  the somewhat ruritanian dreamworld becomes a kind of ur-reality .  the sunshine is exceptionally warm and abundant .  the nights are quiet and misty and eerie and ghostly .  the peasant village is rustic and cozy , the woods old and hoary .  this archetypal realm is the setting for a smart , subtle , literate script , a script which is as good as you'd expect from jordan ( himself an accomplished fiction writer ) and carter .  for carter , the cauldron of story is a witches' brew , bubbling over with primal ingredients : mist-shrouded forests , ancient graveyards , virginal girls and wise women , wolves with glowing eyes .  she adeptly blends them all together .  there is a symbolic richness to the film ; everything is permeated with a sense of significance .  the point of it all , i think , is to represent a girl's rites-of-passage on an unconscious , primordial level .  a night-journey through the forest , from the village to the grandmother's home , is the crux of the company of wolves .   "" don't stray from the path , "" rosaleen is told , again and again , and the path is both literal and figurative : the path through the forest and the path of life .  staying on the path is the conventional approach suggested by rosaleen's elders .  carter and jordan , never conventional , explore what goes on when you leave the path .  those who stray will supposedly meet with a dark fate .  this fate is literalized in the dream as werewolves , but the werewolves connote many things : death , sex , knowledge .  if straying from the path leads to death , then it's not a good idea--but if that's what you have to risk to get sex and knowledge ( and therefore power ) , then maybe it's worth the risk .  when you leave the path , the world becomes a dangerous , ambiguous place , but it's full of potential .  and it's certainly more interesting than the disney version .

1|"contrary to the title , "" the boxer "" is not another rocky story only this time spliced with some cold hard politics .  it's actually three movies in one : a political film , a boxing film , and a love story .  all of these work in their own respects and have some pretty decent balancing betwixt the three elements of the story , but somehow it seems kind of cliched and unoriginal .  we've seen it all before , and we're just not blown away with it like we should be .  oh well .  it's still an excellent irish story .   "" the boxer "" of the title is danny flynn ( jim sheridan staple daniel day-lewis ) , an ex-ira member who gets out of a belfast prison after 14 years , and finds out that his troubles are far from over .  first off , the ira is having a small civil war between its leader joe hamill ( brian cox ) , and one of its sub-leaders , harry ( gerard mcsorley ) , both having opposing views on getting many of their members out of jail .  while this is going on , danny and his old drunkard buddie , ike ( ken stott , who played the chief inspector in danny boyle's "" shallow grave "" ) , re-open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects , protestant and catholics , to work together .  danny not only begins teaching kids how to box , but has stayed in great shape whilst in prison , and is ready to start boxing real people again .  and danny runs into his ex-love , maggie ( "" breaking the waves "" 's emily watson ) , who hasn't seen him since he went in .  they don't easily start up their romance again because she's the wife of a prisoner whom she married during danny's tenure in prison , and also has a son , liam ( ciaran fitzgerald ) , from him , whom liam is hoping will get out soon .  but the two are slowly re-drawn to eachother again , and this begins to complicate things .  the political story is nothing really special but works in itself .  we've seen it many a time before , but it's at least interesting , sometimes emotional , and even riveting at times .  there's a big riot towards the middle of the film which is frightening in its brutality and honesty .  the boxing story is very minor to the story , but does represent people coming together to fight eachother fairly , and even with good sportsmanship .  there are only a few boxing scenes , but they're never like "" raging bull "" /let's-strip-down-the-sport-to-its-bones brilliant .  they're more realistic , and instead of bone crunching , we hear the sound of the gloves hitting eachother , which is slightly unerving at times .  and i didn't know daniel day-lewis was in such good shape .  but the backbone of the story is the love one .  because these characters are given such horrible circumstances , and since the two leads have such great chemistry together , we really feel for their plight .  as the film goes on , and circumstances get worse and worse , the characters have to make real human decisions , and we can sympathize with them as humans not characters .  this is how you write a love story - take note , hollywood .  these elements are pretty much equally balanced , with each of the parts of the stories working hand-in-hand with eachother .  i loved how each of the different parts of the plot mattered , and sometimes spilled over into the next .  it made sure that we didn't just care for one of them .  i'm not saying they're all equally great , because the love story really carries the film , but at least they all work out respectively .  the acting is amazing , with day-lewis and watson giving excellent performances and showing great chemistry .  i'm not sure if they're oscar-nominee bound , but they're very good .  in the supporting roles , billy cox is greatly sympathetic as the ira leader losing control of his daughter and his workers .  but the film is stolen acting wise by ken stott as ike , who is just a great scene stealer .  the direction and co-writing by jim sheridan ( with the other co-writing credit going to terry george ) is excellent , rounding out the characters well , but not pacing everything greatly .  i noticed that the first half was very leisurely ( yet fascinating ) , but the second half whirls by at a quick pace , and ends much too quickly .  more time could have been spent thinking up the ending , since it does seem quite sloppy .  though "" the boxer "" is a good film , it never achieves the greatness that it should .  sure , it's a masterpiece compared to most of the hollywood drivel we usually get , but on it's own , it just could have been better .  but it still works out , gives us a great love story combined with a political and boxing drama , and features great acting .  even if it could have been better , this'll do .

"" it's your turn to be afraid , "" he declares .  returning home on air force one , he gets the chance to demonstrate his words personally .  ultra-nationalist militants loyal to radek and lead by ivan korshunov ( gary oldman ) hijack the plane threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until the general is released .  marshall has a chance to escape in a jettisoned capsule ( which clinton says doesn't exist in real life ) but refuses , preferring to stay and fight .  director wolfgang peterson ( "" das boot "" , "" in the line of fire "" , "" outbreak "" takes the over-used "" die hard "" theme and gives us something new in a film that combines brilliant acting with hold-your-breath intensity .  if you can take your eyes off the screen , steal a look at the audience .  everyone is totally engrossed .  the two actors do what they do best and they are probably the best there are at it .  oldman has become typecast as a psychotic sadist and no wonder -- he does it so well .  when he engages the teenage first daughter in sensitive conversation about his family and the next minute threatens to blow a hole in her forehead , you know that he's over the edge in the manner that people with a cause can become .  you are convinced that young alice could end up terminated at any time .  when korshonov executes passengers , there is a frightening reality to it .  the guns in this film are deadly weapons , not cartoons .  harrison ford has done one role for several years .  his mastery of the man in the suit propelled into desperate action is in top form here .  marshall is a medal of honor recipient who now has a desk job .  realistically , he's a man afraid , but not afraid to act .  ford is one of the few actors that could make us believe that the president of the united states could be an action hero .  indiana jones in the oval office .  he and oldman's archetypes match up perfectly .  the other roles also go to accomplished actors .  glenn close as the determined but unsure vice-president is the picture of an executive forced into a position that she's not quite ready for .  dean stockwell as defense secretary eager for the authority ( "" i'm in charge here ! "" )  is her political nemesis and turns in a good alexander haig performance .  of course the politics are all wrong .  a cowboy president ( even down to his name ) with big guns shoots his way through problems .  much like the american collective memory of jfk's camelot , the image is wondrous if you don't look too deep .  the pulls on the patriotic heartstrings would be too much in any other film , but they work here .  no matter what political spin you put on the story , the movie is an outstanding one .  i left the theater feeling that there is hope for the country's future : not a common belief nowadays .  now if we only can get ford to run for president .  just because one actor didn't work out as chief executive doesn't mean that a different one couldn't .

1|"elizabeth is a potent historical drama set in england in the mid-1500s .  it is a time when stately royal ceremonies are as commonplace as public burnings .  internally , the catholics wage war against the protestants .  meanwhile , spain , scotland and france strategize their next moves in the struggle for power .  little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth ( cate blanchett ) will be their greatest hope for survival .  the film charts elizabeth's tumultuous struggle to gain true power over her kingdom .  as a protestant , she is the last person any of the catholic royalty would want to be queen .  but her half-sister queen mary ( kathy burke ) , deathly ill and unable to conceive a child , pleas with elizabeth to take over the throne .  mary gives her her blessing on only one condition : that elizabeth renounce her faith and uphold the teachings of catholicism across the land .  once declared queen , elizabeth immediately finds herself under assault , both by her own subjects ( including the duke of norfolk , played with steely-eyed grace by christopher eccleston ) and by forces abroad .  slowly but surely , the neophyte ruler takes england by its reigns and forges a new path for her kingdom .  elizabeth is surrounded by a keenly drawn cadre of subjects and advisers .  her closest ally is the mysterious sir francis walsingham ( geoffrey rush , in a perfectly subtle performance ) .  also on her side is sir william cecil ( sir richard attenborough ) , her well-meaning but misguided chief adviser .  with few people she can trust , elizabeth must prove her self-worth any way she can , even if it means being the iron-fisted ruler she secretly despises .  blanchett deserves an oscar for her performance as elizabeth .  she portrays the young queen with just the right balance of gawky self-consciousness and shrewd charisma .  though not a classical beauty , blanchett is able to entrance the viewer with just a coy smile or an impish smirk .  she is at home with her character's playful tendencies , particularly in one scene where elizabeth dances unabashedly with childhood friend and lover lord robert dudley ( joseph fiennes ) .  whether fending off unctuous suitors or "" playing "" the houses in court , blanchett's elizabeth radiates a confidence which impossible to dislike .  almost as interesting as the character of elizabeth are shekhar kapur's visual delights .  he and cinematographer remi adefarasin have crafted a film with a rich color palette that is a feast for the eyes .  rolling green hills , extravagant ceremonial galas , dark and foreboding corridors -- all are depicted with a real sense of artistic appreciation .  the castles and cathedrals of europe have rarely been doted on so lovingly as they are here .  though writer michael hirst's script gets a little murky at times , and his injections of humor get a little overplayed , elizabeth pulses with the right amount of dramatic and cinematic verve to make it just deserving of a theatrical viewing .  as a whole , the story survives because elizabeth's struggle is one which deserves attention .  by the time she makes her shocking ( but very sensible ) final declaration , we're ready to bow to elizabeth as our own queen .

1|set in the wild west , this carry on centres around the arrival of the rumpo kid ( sidney james ) and his cronies in stodge city .  his dodgy dealings and summary shootings aggravate judge burke ( kenneth williams ) so much that he asks sheriff albert earp ( jon pertwee ) to drive rumpo out of town .  instead , the rumpo kid shoots the sheriff dead .  therefore , judge burke sends for a law marshall to come in and clean up the city .  due to a misunderstanding , an english sanitary engineer called marshall p . knutt ( jim dale ) is assigned , without knowing it , as the law marshall for stodge city .  he arrives at the same time as annie oakley ( angela douglas ) who is seeking revenge for her father , the sheriff's murder .  when marshall arrives at stodge city , he soon becomes aware of the misunderstanding and due to his rather limited intellect , he is manipulated by the rumpo kid and always ends up getting things wrong .  in the end , there is a head-to-head between rumpo and marshall .  with the rumpo's past experience , it would seem that marshall is out of his depth , but using his sanitary skills and learning the ways of the west from annie oakley , he at least stands some chance !  sid james , with an american accent , is perfect as the rumpo kid , a part which suits him down to the ground .  jim dale provides one of his best carry on performances as the stupid sanitary engineer , and angela douglas is very effective in her role as the revengeful daughter .  other regulars that appear in this movie include charles hawtrey and bernard bresslaw ( in his debut ) as big heap and little heap respectively .  big heap is the local indian leader and the crazy casting of hawtrey for this part is very amusing , as is his performance : - he steals every scene he is in even though he does not enter the film until thirty minutes past .  joan sims provides useful and amusing support as belle , the local bar owner who takes a fancy to the rumpo kid .  however , the part of doc played by peter butterworth and sheriff albert earp played by jon pertwee are not really necessary , and pertwee's performance is rather poor .  kenneth williams uses a new voice but struggles with the weak part of the 'judge' .  even so , this carry on was sid james and kenneth williams' favourite .  a very different carry on film , in that it is played more seriously by the actors and possesses more realism than any other carry on .  the death count is the highest of any carry on film .  sets , costumes and action sequences are all very commendable .  the songs that are included in the movie ( the title song and annie's song ) are very impressive .  a strange but therefore very interesting carry on film .  not the best of its kind but it is certainly the most distinctive film of the series .  |0.042666666666666665|0.7866666666666666|0.86|"The movie ""Carry On Cowboy"" receives a generally positive sentiment, with praise for the performances, sets, costumes, and songs, while also mentioning some weak aspects such as unnecessary characters and weak performances."
1|"for example , in happy gilmore , sandler plays a rookie golfer trying to beat a self-confident jerk of a pro .  if the star were any other comic , that would be enough motivation to drive the movie , but with sandler , the rookie also wants to win the prize money to help his grandma keep her house .  that extra motive doesn't make happy gilmore a funnier movie .  it doesn't really add any genuine emotional depth , either .  in fact , the motive is almost totally irrelevant to the movie .  but sandler's philosophy seems to be , if it's a token gesture , why not make it a nice gesture ?  that is endlessly refreshing .  in the wedding singer , sandler is right on track .  the fact that he's a wedding singer is only superficially relevant to the story .  what kind of a wedding singer he is is even less important .  david spade could have filled the role with cynicism and sarcasm .  he could make fun of the fat , ugly , or embarrassing people he meets at weddings , and the story would be intact .  but sandler instead brings a mature goodness to the character .  he seems to really enjoy the people at weddings and treats them as though they were his own family .  robbie hart ( sandler ) doesn't just sing at weddings ; he also gets the loners to join in and have fun , and he smooths it over when someone does something embarrassing .  he is exactly the man you would want at your wedding .  the day comes when robbie has his own wedding , and he is stood up by his heavy-metal bride ( the movie is set in 1985 ) .  robbie takes it hard .  he doesn't sleep , he doesn't eat , and he gets punched out at work when he sings "" love stinks "" at a wedding .  julia ( drew barrymore ) , who waitresses all the weddings in town , gives him a shoulder to cry on and an ear to talk to .  eventually , robbie starts rebounding toward julia .  he really likes her , but she's engaged .  her fianc ? is a self-confident jerk ( do i see a trend - nope , just a formula ) who doesn't deserve her , but robbie is too depressed to fight for her hand .  julia seems to like robbie too , but she can't leave her seemingly safe and stable fianc ? for the off-chance that robbie might be serious about her .  you know the story .  you've seen it a million times before .  there's always a new way to tell it , with new lovers , new chemistry , and new details , but it's the same story .  and sometimes , it works .  the wedding singer works .  first of all , the chemistry between sandler and barrymore is effective .  actually , it's not so much the chemistry between the two as it is each one's own romantic tension .  sandler captures the forlorn sleepwalking look of a jilted man , struck with an unattainable love .  barrymore is charming as the girl next door looking for someone serious to settle down with .  sparks don't fly when they kiss , but they both seem right for each other .  second , their love is mature .  they are not driven by passionate sexual attraction - they're a cute couple , but neither sandler nor barrymore is centerfold material .  instead , they are both looking for someone meaningful , someone to settle down with , someone to grow old with .  at a wedding , robbie comforts a kid throwing up in a dumpster while julia sits by .  the repulsing situation is taken in stride , as if the two were already parents , caring for their sick child .  the ? 80s soundtrack and references play a big part in this movie .  other critics liked this movie in part because of the '80s soundtrack .  i liked it in spite of the soundtrack .  often , the music and references felt forced .  for example , robbie tells his ex-fianc ? to "" get out of my van halen t-shirt before you jinx the band and they break up . ""   ( ha ha ha .  get it ?  david lee roth did leave van halen ! )  or how about when sammy ( allen covert ) , robbie's chauffeur friend , shows up at a party wearing a michael jackson jacket and - get this - a single silver glove .   ( that's exactly what mj used to wear all the time ! ) .  unfortunately , making fun of generalizations about a past era is too easy to be rewarding .  that's not to say the movie isn't funny .  screenwriter tim herlihy has written for sandler before ( billy madison and happy gilmore ) , and the two make a good combination .  herlihy knows what sort of jokes sandler is good at and has tailored the script to his straight-faced , smart-aleck style .  let's hope herlihy and sandler stick together for a few more projects because this movie really won me over .  with barrymore's charm and sandler's heart , it was hard to go wrong .

""  truer words are hard to come by .  of course , it doesn't hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors , james cameron , who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time .  if you wish to argue that point with me , look at his list of credits : the terminator , aliens , the abyss , terminator 2 , true lies , etc . still care to disagree ?  not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it .  and to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs .  it's obvious he truly loves titanic .  the film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the "" heart of the ocean "" , which , according to bill paxton's character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today .  their search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond .  this picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture .  she is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond .  almost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past .  rose's narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn't want to marry .  her mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant .  they are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal .  meanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game .  they are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving .  for them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life .  for rose , she is sailing to her doom .  the first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love .  it's the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches .  but as i said above , the love portion isn't sappy and doesn't "" weigh the film down "" , as some critics have said .  it's sweet , and it didn't make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories .  of course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen .  most of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on .  all of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch .  of course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom .  the sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing .  it is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths .  the best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future .  the crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose's story , now are totally aborbed by her .  rose goes out onto the ship's ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard .  we then see a dream of rose's , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson .  most people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream .  however , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life : her and her one true love , jack .  if anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this , e-mail me at venom8@hotmail . com .

1|"sometimes you just have to tip your hat to a film .  sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride .  i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers , most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes .  surprised , they may have been , when they realized that this picture actually had something to say .  but by the attentiveness of the crowd i'd say they were won over - as was i . i can't tell yet if truman really is that good , or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year .  time alone will make that call .  but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank's side .  we were concerned for his well-being , and wanted him to win .  that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey , who has achieved legitimacy at last .  the truman show is a film best viewed cold , with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot .  unless you're under a media blackout , however , you probably know the basics .  carrey stars as truman burbank , a capra-esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl ( laura linney ) in the south florida island town of seahaven , which looks like michael eisner's idea of the perfect american small town .  truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle , complete with a working wife , a best bud , friendly neighbors and interesting co-workers .  there is tragedy in his past - his father drowned in a horrible boating accident , leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water , and of travel in general - but overall , life is good .  but then one day as truman leaves his house for work , a klieg light falls magically from the sky .  this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows : that he is a prisoner on the world's biggest soundstage , that his wife , friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him , and that his life has , for over 10 , 000 days , been broadcast as the world's most popular television program .  what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir .  the soundstage , we're told , is "" only the second man-made structure visible from space . ""  truman's movements are tracked ceaselessly by 5 , 000 cameras scattered throughout the town : button cams , dashboard cams , mirror cams , wife cams , big cams and small cams .  weir cuts the film so we're never quite sure if we're watching truman through the camera of director weir or through the camera of the show's omnipotent creator christof ( ed harris ) who oversees the show from a control room built into the man-made moon in seahaven's sky .  the second act offers a plethora of clues for truman as to the truth of his existence .  his best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) always has a six pack of beer with him .  his wife seems to exist in an eternal commercial in which she is always endorsing the latest hot household product .  he sees the same people walking in the same set patterns all over town .  one wonders why he didn't pick up on any of this earlier , but christof has an answer for this : "" people tend to accept the reality with which they're presented . ""  nevertheless , truman begins to grow restless , and dreams of escape to fiji , where an old college sweetheart ( natasha mcelhone ) supposedly lives .  this convincing reality of television as progenitor of reality is a magical and provocative concept ; the best thing jim carrey does is stay out of its way .  by underplaying truman , he allows the subtle manipulations of the film to take over .  there is a particularly poignant scene in which truman confides his fears to marlon , and marlon answers with best-friend sincerity , "" i'd gladly step in front of a bus for you . ""  but that line was fed to marlon through an earpiece by christof .  the abject cruelty to which truman is subjected to hits home - and from that moment , we're on his side .  the truman show derives much of its success from playing to our own secret paranoid fantasies - haven't we all , at least once , doubted our place in the world , doubted the sincerity of those closest to us ?  ultimately , however , the picture rises above its own artifice to raise some real questions about the relationship of humankind and our creator .  what does god really think of us ?  does he resent our abandonment of paradise ?  who exactly is watching us , up there in the sky ?  if you enjoy the picture as much as i did , credit weir for allowing the magic of the screenplay to work .  as for carrey - well , truman burbank is the kind of role that jimmy stewart was born to play .  carrey is no jimmy stewart ; to his credit , he doesn't try to be .  he just tries to feel the way you or i would , if we suddenly found out that the whole world was watching us .

1|"i didn't realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa ( the motion picture association of america - the folks who decide what's g , nc 17 , pg , r or x ) to ask why the preview was rated r . so that we can make some sense of their response , let me tell you about the movie itself .   "" the celluloid closet "" is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades .  it's brilliant , funny , naughty and extremely poignant .  it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that , as a rule , gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen .  regardless of how veiled - or how sordid - the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they're not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be .  the movie itself is rated r - and for good reason .  it contains scenes of bloody , violent gay bashing and graphic , uninhibited , sex .  as with any movie , i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time , so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend , a date , my 11 year old niece , alone or not at all .  but , that's the movie .  now back to the preview .  prior to this film being theatrically released ( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo ) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times .  there was no nudity , no violence , no bad language , nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience ( okay , whoopi goldberg did refer to someone "" boning "" someone , but the last i knew that wasn't one of the seven words you can't say on tv ) .  except for a scene of two fully clothed men kissing .  hmmmmm .  when i inquired about the rating on the trailer , a very nice woman at the mpaa quoted from "" the handbook "" that a trailer approved for all audiences could contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism and no going down on someone . ""  hello ? i was in the office and it was the middle of the day .  bravely , i pursued .   "" i've seen that trailer , oh . . .  probably half a dozen times , "" i gulped . . .   "" and i don't remember that scene . ""   "" well , "" she chirped .   "" it's there .  our little eyes are trained to see that . ""  no really .  in the words of dave barry , "" i am not making this up . ""  they are "" trained "" to "" see that ? ""  when someone who was shocked at the rating the first time and made a note to watch it carefully the following five times or so managed to let it slip past her ?  gosh , i certainly don't mean to question the mpaa , or "" the handbook "" .  i would , however , like to suggest that it's they who are in the closet on this one .  and the light ain't good in there .  but , having seen "" the celluloid closet , "" and being one of a handful of straight people involved in a primarily gay and lesbian weekly bible study ( email me and i'll give you the details ) , none of this was any big surprise .  the point of the movie was that homosexuality , even in the politically correct 90s , is ridiculously perceived as a threat to a mostly heterosexual society .  a point well made in this candid and honest film .  now , i could go off on the mpaa's ruling that a trailer must contain "" no homosexuality or lesbianism "" and ask how that is defined , particularly in light of some of the things , both sexual and non-sexual , that i've watched straight people do in trailers .  i just don't feel the need to go there , because it seems so obvious .  i'll instead suggest that the mpaa re-evaluated their evaluation criteria .  let the ratings reflect not subject content , like "" sex "" and "" violence "" .  let them reflect attitude content .  in the future , i'd be interested in knowing whether the movie is rated d for disrespectful or s for stereotyped .  then i'd truly be able to make an informed decision about how i spent my time .

1|"118 minutes ; not rated ( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language )  mamoru oshii is a name that probably isn't very well-known to most american audiences , but perhaps it should be .  oshii was the director of last year's best-known japanese animated film import , _ghost in the shell_ , and is known among fans of japanese animation , or anime , for making films with a deep philosophical bent .  one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series .  in its many incarnations--graphic novels ( "" manga "" ) , two different runs of made-for-video episodes ( original animation videos , or oavs for short ) , and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes--patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan .  set in the very near future ( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived ) , this atypical giant robot anime features the characters , rather than the machinery , as the primary focus .  as a whole , patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan .  as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains , giant industrial robots , known as "" labors "" ( an interesting play on words , considering that "" robot "" is derived from the czech word for labor ) , have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century .  with the rise of labors , however , has come a new menace--labor crime .  this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions , using patrol labors to fight labor crime .  the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division , sv2 , who , through no fault of their own , have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness .  sometimes utterly hilarious , sometimes almost deadly serious , the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers , and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life .  those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie , although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers .  the story , as has much of patlabor before , centers around the controversial babylon project , a gigantic seawall that will , on its completion , allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay .  this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists , most notably the house of sea organization .  however , the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist , but from someone who is already dead . . .  shinohara heavy industries , the premier labor manufacturer in japan ( if not the whole world ) , has just come out with a new operating system that increases labors' movement speed and efficiency by 30% .  this hyper operating system , hos for short , has very quickly been installed into well over 90% of the nation's labors . . . including the patrol labors of sv2 .  since that installation , dozens of labors , including a heavily-armed military model , have begun to go on berzerk rampages for no apparent reason . . . and the only factor they all had in common was that they were all running under the new hos .   ( some wags have compared this to windows 95 . )  it's up to asuma shinohara , labor command officer with sv2 and the son of the president of shinohara heavy industries , to find the source of these problems before more labors--including sv2's own--fall victim to them , and before hos drags his father's company down with it .  as was the case with _ghost in the shell_ , if you just want a no-brainer actionfest , this might not be the movie for you .  _patlabor : the movie_ is more of a psychological thriller , a technological suspense drama .  it is closer , perhaps , to a chrichton novel than to an action movie ( crichton novels that have been made _into_ action movies notwithstanding ) .  there are long , thoughtful montages of dialogueless footage as two investigators make their way through slums and derelict housing in old quarters of tokyo , similar to sequences from _ghost in the shell_ .  this movie is fraught with symbolism--in fact a large part of it is based on christian symbolism .  patlabor's near-future setting is , aside from the giant robots tromping around , very similar to our own present day .  the film uses this setting to make its central point : is progress moving too fast for humans to keep up ?  are history and culture falling by the wayside like the old buildings that are being torn down and replaced with new ?  this is a question just as applicable to today as it is to patlabor's alternate-1999 setting .  as far as the technical aspects of the film go ( referring to the subtitled version , as that's the only one i've seen ) , the film transfer is clear , almost phenomenally so .  the animation quality is incredible , though the character design is different from what most patlabor fans will be used to .  the oavs and tv series were more cheerful , better-suited to humor ; the movie , however , makes everyone look a great deal less cute , and emphasizes that this is going to be , for the most part , a deadly serious storyline .  as far as cinematography goes , there are many interesting moments in _patlabor : the movie_ .  i don't think i can recall ever seeing a fish-eye perspective used in any other animated film ( save for _ghost in the shell_ , another oshii film ) , or indeed , in many other movies at all .  the cinematography is well-suited to the storyline , emphasizing what it needs to , though a couple of scenes ( where characters' features are exaggerated in anger ) may seem slightly strange to western audiences .  the audio track of _patlabor : the movie_ is in glorious hi-fi stereo , and should be used to demonstrate home theater systems--it _is_ that good .  even without headphones , sounds from either side of the screen can be clearly heard to _come_ from that side .  giant robot footsteps are deep and booming .  the sometimes-understated , sometimes-blaring score is crisp and clear , and always right on the mark , enhancing the moods created by the animated scenery .  as far as the subtitles go , i have to say that they're among the most easily-readable subtitles i've ever seen for _anything_ .  large enough that they don't strain the eyes , but small enough not to conceal too much of the screen .  although it does have several action sequences in it , most notably the climactic conclusion , _patlabor_ is foremost not an action movie .  although it is a superbly-realized film , it relies in large part upon prior familiarity with some of the characters to carry the story , and that could detract from some people's enjoyment .  my .

1|taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers .  the story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters .  everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers .  although qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride .  liman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good .  the film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good .  there's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk .  the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life .  holmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature .  askew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious .  no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying .  he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it .  the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining .  also entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance .  the script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes .  it starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better .  the stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another .  also , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky .  still , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it .  it could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag .  because this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go's one is pretty decent .  unlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , which is a plus .  go is a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters .  thankfully , they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . )  they are who they are and they stay that way .  go is great fun , and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers .  ignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride .  erm , go to go , i guess .  |0.616|0.8166666666666668|0.9|The text is predominantly positive as it praises the film's entertainment value, talented cast, sharp script, and Sarah Polley's performance, with only minor criticisms of certain characters and aspects of the script.
1|"garry shandling makes his long overdue starring film debut as an alien from a planet populated only by genetically created men , who are looking to take over the earth by propagating their own species there .  shandling is chosen for the mission , is given the name harold anderson , and is set up as a banker in seattle .  after a few disastrous "" mating "" attempts , he figures his best bet will be susan ( annette bening ) , a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she won't have sex again until she gets married .  the leader of harold's planet ( ben kingsley ) tells him to marry her , and harold is soon exposed to all the "" joys "" of married life .  despite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s , what planet are you from ?  is a very funny movie .  the plot ( which the film wisely doesn't linger on the specifics of for too long ) is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes , most of which work very well .  the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many , and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead .  but he brings a sort of pathetic charm to the role , and it's his performance that makes the film truly funny instead of just offensive .  plus if you think about it , what planet are you from ?  could have very easily gone the gross-out route ( considering that shandling's character is given a detachable penis that vibrates and hums when he gets excited ) .  we never see anything though , it's all implied , which gives the film a touch of class amidst its crudeness .  i'm glad to see that someone in hollywood still understands the concept of "" less is more "" .  the talented supporting cast certainly adds to one's enjoyment of this film .  annette bening ( oddly playing a merged version of her real estate salesman character from american beauty and her ditzy spiritualist character from mars attacks ! )  does a fine job keeping up with shandling and makes a good catalyst for his brand of humor .  she even manages to pull off a potentially disastrous scene where she has to perform a rather goofy rendition of "" high hopes "" for a lengthy period of time .  ben kingsley , john goodman and greg kinnear all fare well in their performances as well , and linda fiorentino . . .  good lord , there should be some sort of law stating that no woman can be that sexy .  everything about her character in this film oozes raw sexuality .  what planet are you from ?  is available on dvd from columbia tristar home video .  the disc gives you the choice of either watching the film full frame or in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 ( and enhanced for 16x9 televisions .  also included on the disc as extras : a decent making-of featurette , an isolated score track , talent files for the cast and crew , and the film's original theatrical trailer ( as well as trailers for wolf , men in black , bugsy and as good as it gets ) .  when i first saw that the disc featured an isolated score track , i actually laughed .  how great could the music for a silly little comedy be for it to get it's own isolated track ?  well as it turns out , it's a mighty fine score from carter burwell ( fargo , the hudsucker proxy ) that i enjoyed listening to again while i typed up this review .  kudos to columbia tristar for adding that feature to the disc .  what planet are your from ?  was unjustly ignored in theaters , and i hope it finds its deserved audience on home video .  this fine dvd is certainly a great way to see it .
