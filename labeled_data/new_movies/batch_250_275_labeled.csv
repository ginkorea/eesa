1|"kadosh means sacred in hebrew .  amos gitai's fictional work , after spending most of his career doing documentaries , is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage , even though the marriage is a loving one .  the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic's intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government .  gitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel .  the emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god's law from only the male's view .  that if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are .  the story takes place in jerusalem's jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel .  this is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief .  it is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go .  the force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance .  the film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can't at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace .  the film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god .  he even thanks god that he didn't make him a woman .  his wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom .  she looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv .  meir is a talmudic scholar .  his father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva .  he has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child .  since the hasidim look upon a woman's role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man's role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage .  she receives an anonymous letter that states "" a woman without a child is no better than dead . ""  meir's response , is that it is written like that in the talmud .  meir's father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : "" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . ""  all the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren .  she will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel .  their religion doesn't permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor .  rivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion .  so when meir's father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters .  rivka's spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life .  she has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov .  but , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin .  when yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer .  he now works as a singer in a nightclub .  malka's mother is worried that her daughter won't get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn't love .  yossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies .  the two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage .  the harshest scene in the film is on malka's wedding night .  yossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love .  the sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does .  but the choices are obliterated by one's beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up .  for the sisters , the choices are life or death ones .  gitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close-knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life .  the film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed .  "|-0.5833333333333334|0.8166666666666668|0.75|The text explains that the film portrays a negative and controversial story about a failed Hasidic marriage, criticizing the rigid and intolerant attitudes of ultra-orthodox Jews towards women, and highlighting the societal consequences of such attitudes.
1|"the film "" magnolia "" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests .  the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower .  they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart .  the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially .  from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain .  they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness .  whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one .   "" magnolia "" is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of "" boogie nights "" fame .  the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make "" magnolia "" memorable .  however , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing .  anderson's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful .  he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of "" magnolia's "" scenes drag on too long .  any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending .  from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn't get boring .  it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot .  this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation .  every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees .  for example , cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall's daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly .  the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer .  anderson's explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing .  the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously .  this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get .  the performances in "" magnolia "" are perfection .  this is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting .  anderson allows many of hollywood's best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting .  all of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film .  worth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance .  he was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon's character as phillip baker hall's wife .  she seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film .   "" magnolia "" uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters .  anderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours .  to see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity .  diversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time .  i predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future .

1|"no humans were harmed , tested or tasted in the making of this film .  all recipes are fictions .  twentieth century fox does not condone cannibalism .  a psychological thriller that will scare you to the depth of your soul !  director/writer antonia bird shows us that the most terrifying horror is not provided by giant beasts , but instead by monsters lurking in ourselves . .   "" . . they were a party of settlers in covered wagon times and they had to resent to cannibalism in order to stay alive . . ""  this true story , briefly mentioned in "" the shining "" , has no turned into a 143 minutes long motion picture .  in 1847 , the united states was a land of pioneers , of gold-starved americans making their way west .  it was a period of manifest destiny , the inevitability of the country extending its boundaries , stretching out its arms and consuming all the land it could .  capt . john boyd ( guy pearce ) has become both a "" hero "" and a victim during this period of relentless consumption . . .  in ways he could never have imagined .  boyd's journey to hell begins when he is awarded for an act of cowardice during a horrific mexican-american war battle earns him banishment to a desolate military outpost , a waystation for western travelers in the barren and icy sierra nevada mountains in california .  upon his arrival he is greeted by a small , motley group of soldiers , including his commanding officer , hart ( jeffrey jones ) , a previously intelligent and sophisticated man who has lost his aristocratic origin in the heat of battle and has pretty much given up on life ; toffler ( jeremy davies ) , the fort's personal emissary to the lord ; knox ( stephen spinella ) , the veterinarian that plays doctor , who never met a bottle of whiskey he didn't like ; reich ( neal mcdonough ) , the no-nonsense soldier of the group ; and the seriously "" over-medicated "" cleaves ( david arquette ) , a cook whose meals are inspired more by peyote than culinary ambitions .  into this cold , bleak and bizarre world staggers a stranger , colqhoun ( robert carlyle ) , a half-starved scot who had been traveling with a group of settlers until they became snowbound .  seeking refuge in a cave , they soon ran out of food - and were forced to consume one another .  colqhoun barely escaped becoming an hors d'oeuvre himself .  our heroes then decide to journey through the mountains to find the survivors , and colqhoun tags along to help out .  soon it becomes clear that colqhoun's tale has ramifications beyond cannibalism and the will to survive .  it involves an old indian myth called weendigo , which states that a man who eats the flesh of another steals that person's strength , spirit and very essence .  his hunger becomes an insatiable craving : the more he eats , the more he wants , and the stronger he becomes .  there can never be enough , and death is the only escape . .  it's all fairly sickening and you have to have a healthy stomach to see the whole movie through .  as professionally made as the movie is , you have to wonder who they thought would come piling into the theater to see this .  teen-age horror fans won't care because none of the soldiers look remotely like neve campell .  older folks might show up when they hear that the movie is actually a satire about the pioneer spirit , but they'll be disappointed once all the raw meat starts getting waved in their faces .  but jokes aside , this is a film that is well worth watching .  it has wonderful and mature characters , that few horror film s can boast of and a strangely effective story that continues to electrify you till the end .  the two main characters are also the most interesting .  boyd is a simple , honest man tiered of war , killing and fear .  his sacred wish is to live a normal , quite life away from gunpowder and blood .  colqhoun is different .  he proves that a man , on the brink of death , would do anything to stay alive , including sacrificing his own soul .  he believes so much in this indian myth that he starts to change physically .  it is the power of the human mind and conviction that make miracles happen .  the atmosphere in "" ravenous "" is macabre and bizarre , scary and surreal .  completely isolated from the rest of the world , stands fort spencer .  here time stands still , and nothing changes .  the inhabitants are soldiers driven by war and pillage .  they are all somehow losers of society that have been banished -- men that are used to killing and have not done anything else in their entire life .  men that are nothing , and has nothing to loose .  the result is some sort of cabin fever .  cannibalism is more like a sick game for them .  since they find no pleasure in living , they find some excitement in killing and dying .  it's like "" who's going to die first ? ""  the unchangeable icy landscape , where birds do not sing and even wind doesn't move the leaves on the trees , resembles kubrick's "" the shining "" .  it's hard to not get mad here !  one of the scary aspects of the film is a strange connection that the viewer establishes with the characters , and starts to understand them , although they have turned into half crazed killers .  music is another factor that strengthens the atmosphere .  a strange musical score , composed by michael nyman ( the piano ) and damon albarn , that often seems out of place , and in complete contrast to the image , somehow reflects the characters' twisted reactions on the world and their situation .  the director herself stated that it was "" ok to laugh "" during the picture .  and i must admit that it is often very funny , in a strange way ( such as the wonderful quote : "" . . it's  lonely being a cannibal .  you don't get that many friends . . . ""  or when colqhoun is quoting ben franklin , saying "" eat to live .  don't live to eat . "" ) . but  mostly it is frightening and shocking as it goes deeper into the minds of these strange men and we witness their psychological change .  every actor does a great job .  especially robert carlyle as the sinister and intelligent cannibal , and guy pearce as the moral and honest soldier , nagged by his undeserved honor .  this strange couple resemble lestat and lois in neil jordan's 'interview with the vampire' .  actually there are many amusing parallels and connections to vampire movies , since the topics are so alike .   "" ravenous "" starts wonderfully and continues to shock and scare until it gets to the finale , where it looses focus and gets too primitive and rather boring .  however these little failures don't diminish the impression .  this is a bizarre dark comedy about the human mind and its change in different situations .  it is a scary fable about the monster that lurks in everyone's soul , a dark side which we're all trying to hide -- but it's there -- always .  it is one of the most frightening and successful horror films since "" the shining "" .

1|curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won't appeal to everyone .  to be specific , let me give you an example .  do you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ?  if you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don't see curdled .  on the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at .  our film's heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles .  luckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big .  the killer's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he's played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler ) .  one particularly striking m . o .  on the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims .  gabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests .  she immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post-forensic cleaning service .  no points for guessing what they do .  her workmates are confused by gabriela's fascination with murder ; to them , it's just a day job .  there's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say .  gabriela's partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela's wide-eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer's latest scene - they're the messiest , you see .  unbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he's also heading over there . .  the comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival .  apparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature-length film .  there are other parallels - the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who's probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death-obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction .  that role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr .  jones is great in curdled - she's wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character's innocence or likeability .  she can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow .  it's a great performance .  reb braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste .  the best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing - any more than that would be a spoiler .  the opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing .  of course , it's impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you're not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result .  the one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag .  while its running time is already a short 94 minutes , it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing .  curdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax .  it'll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well .  |0.5666666666666667|0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|"The text provides a mixed sentiment review of the movie ""Curdled"" mentioning positive aspects such as the dark and witty comedy, praise for the lead actress and director, and funny scenes.

( which is key to the conclusion's said ambiguity ) .  the performances by the three leads are abrasive at first , self-consciously "" quirky "" ; the introductory scenes are a chore .  these people do grow on you because they convey genuine passion , a belief in themselves , and because they have long-term goals ; henry and simon may drink a lot of budweiser and hang out on the streetcorner , but they aren't pop slackers .  the story is rather classical : the tutor is a better talker than a doer , raised on books ; the timid tutee has innate talent his master only dreams of .   ( shades of film school . . . )  the finished film is epic in its proportions for a story so small , and the final third does test one's patience , yet henry fool is tight , hardly excessive in its length .  how refreshing to see a movie this long in 1998 devoted entirely to character .  and unless i nodded off , not a single building exploded .  this , hartley's seventh feature , is contemplative about "" the artist "" ; fortunately , we never get a sampling of simon's work , and it's a testament to the actors and the screenplay that by the end we can surmise what sort of thoughts would pour from these writers' pens .

1|"most people fit into two different categories : you either love woody allen , or you hate his guts .  my family , for the most part , hates him and his movies .  i think he's very funny , but his shtick has gotten forced and contrived over the years .  so maybe taking his body away was the best decision any producer could have thought of .  unrestrained by physical boundaries , allen's humor comes shining through .  those who had problems with his physical appearance will be able to join the rest of us in laughing at allen's intelligent observations of life .  those who had problems with his verbal comedy may want to skip this one .  in 1995 , a film was introduced to audiences which sparked their imaginations and showed them something they'd never seen before .  toy story used state-of-the-art computer technology and presented a world of toys who would come alive when no humans were present .  many critics will call that a better film , but i believe they only say that because it was a completely original motion picture .  antz , however , has upped the ante considerably .  disney's a bug's life isn't due out for another two months , and dreamworks seems to have received the better end of the deal .  by beating disney out , they have satisfied the audience's thirst for computer-animated films .  but don't let that fool you : disney is definitely not scared .  in the past two years , competitions have broken out between studios .  in 1997 , it was the volcano duel .  in my opinion , dante's peak came out way ahead of its predecessor , both in time and in quality .  volcano had an original premise , but destroyed that with some very ridiculous situations .  in 1998 , there are twice as many competing films .  first was the comet competition , and armageddon blew away it's cheesily dramatic competitor deep impact .  but now , it's even more interesting , as one beloved studio ( disney ) goes up against the newcomer ( dreamworks ) .  who will prevail ?  time will tell , but i'm sure that mr . mouse has nothing to fear .  this may sound like i didn't like antz ; on the contrary , i'd put it up there with toy story .  but due to it's pg rating , many parents may be put off by some of the dialogue which shouldn't appear in disney's version .  some of the dialogue in antz pushes the envelope for a family-oriented film .  sexual innuendoes and profanity pop up occasionally , which makes dreamworks' animated feature geared more for an adult crowd .  the humor is also written especially for adults , though many kids were laughing in the theater i attended .  this is the type of film that should be made for families more often : entertaining for kids and entertaining for parents .  antz begins with a hilarious monologue which seems a meld between woody allen's shtick and franz kafka's metamorphosis , the short story of a man who wakes up to discover himself as a bug .  z ( allen ) is a troubled ant , believing he was not made to be a worker .   "" when you're the middle child in a family of five million . . . "" he comments about his neglected childhood .  one night , z is sitting in a bar with his friend weaver ( sylvester stallone ) , discussing his pathetic place in life .  in walks princess bala ( sharon stone ) , whom no one recognizes without a crown .  bala asks z is he would like to dance , and they engage in a pulp fiction-esque dance while everyone else is following the leader .  after discovering that she is the princess , z falls in love , but there's a problem : bala is getting married to general mandible ( gene hackman ) , a ruthless leader who merely wants to control a better and stronger colony .  in order to do that , he must eliminate not only the queen ( anne bancroft ) , but the weakest of the colony , namely the worker ants .  but to get rid of the queen , he needs to get rid of the loyal army ants who would be willing to die for her .  he and colonel cutter ( christopher walkin ) come up with a plan to send the loyal ants off to battle , where they will surely be killed .  the queen is reluctant at first , but decides it is best for the colony .  meanwhile , z wants to meet bala again , and he asks weaver , an army ant , to switch places with him .  so z gets sent off to battle , but he manages to survive the slaughter by the termites .  the battle sequence is absolutely stunning , though you may have flashbacks to starship troopers , which contained a very similar sequence .  however , antz and that 1997 film were both in production around the same time , so the similarities are merely coincidence .  the second half of the film revolves around z's kidnapping of bala , and their search for a mythical place called insectopia .  there , an ant can be his own boss and have all the food he wants .  the adventures z and bala get into are surprisingly high in tension , especially one involving a magnifying glass .  looming over the targets like the spaceships from independence day ( in fact , i'm just going to assume that the producers referenced id4 intentionally ) .  the ants look up in awe , and then a beam of fire blasts into the ground .  visually , it's an exciting rush of adrenaline .  but don't be fooled . . .  little kids shouldn't see this , as they may just try and copy it .  after seeing antz , i vowed never to intentionally step on an ant again .  hopefully , children will learn that killing ants is rather cruel .  as an animated film , antz is probably the best you will find to date .  visually , it's as stunning as what dreams may come .  the best aspect of animation is the fact that the characters aren't limited by gravity .  they can take ridiculous situations and make them seem plausible .  one great moment involves a mass of worker ants bunching up to form a wrecking ball .  the animation is so perfect that you can virtually see every single ant on the ball .  however , the most exhilarating scene involves bala getting stuck to the bottom of a young boy's shoe .  it's truly a great example of film making at its finest .  with computer technology , the animators have carefully made the ants' faces look similar to the actors providing the voices .  the best example would have to be barbatus ( danny glover ) .  at one point , you can even see the pores on his face ( although , i doubt ants have pores . . .  do they ? ) .  barbatus also has a touching but rather gruesome scene as he has his final words with z without a body .  young kids may be disturbed by the site of a dismembered head , but a good deal of humor is derived ( more appropriate for adults , of course ) .  disney's a bug's life looks good , but i don't know if they will be able to best dreamworks' newest animated feature in terms of animation .  if not , then dreamworks will have done something no other studio could do : go head to head with the big mouse , and knock him down ( yes , anastasia was good , but not nearly as good as even the worst of disney ) .  vocal talent is always essential to an animated feature , and antz has one of the best line-ups seen since toy story .  in fact , it far exceeds that one .  woody allen has always been funny , but here he transcends most of what he's done in the past few years .  without a body , his comic timing is the most noticeable thing .  in fact , i'm pretty sure that the writers let him improvise a lot of his lines .  sharon stone as bala shows off some of her comic ability , though for the most part , stone works best as a dramatic actress .  sylvester stallone ( teamed up with stone once again ) is beginning to solidify his statement that he wants to be an actor , not a typecast action star .  after a snub at the oscars last year , stallone is proving himself as the serious ( or comedic , as illustrated here ) actor that he is .  gene hackman is superb as the gruff-talking general , almost doing another take on his crimson tide persona .  christopher walkin is probably more noticed by his voice , and so many people will remember him from such hits as batman returns .  anne bancroft has a minimal role , but she's effective nonetheless .  danny glover has a small role , but he does a very , very good job .  dan aykroyd and jane curtin also lend their voices as two lovesick , euro-trash bees--both are very unrecognizable , especially aykroyd .  jennifer lopez plays a worker ant who falls in love with weaver , although most people won't recognize her voice either .  many people will recognize grant shaud's voice as the foreman .  he played miles on the tv show murphy brown .  this is definitely a huge cast with some high-profile names , and it will definitely help it's grosses .  of course , you can probably tell where a lot of the $60 million budget went to , also .  directors eric darnell and lawrence guterman are relative newcomers ( though guterman did direct a 1994 feature , headless ! ) .  but both show an incredible talent for this type of a picture .  tense at times , and very funny throughout , the two hold this film together like professionals .  the screenplay by todd alcott and chris weitz is quite simple in plot , but it contains a lot of subtlety that makes the film more suitable for adults .  kids will delight in the animation , while parents can laugh heartily at the humor .  most of it will go over young children's heads .  does that mean you shouldn't take kids to see it ?  not at all .  they will have a lot of fun watching this one .  what is great is the themes that are given to us .  part social commentary , part romance story , and part moral drama , antz gives everyone something to talk about , whether it be the animation , or the discussions of individualism and community .  thankfully , it's not subtle in either aspects .  antz is rated pg for mild language and some intense action .  sometimes the language can be pushing the limits for a family movie , but the violence is what should keep kids at home .  the battle scene has ants melting in acid , and bugs being speared to death .  and the magnifying scene shows an ant disintegrate in the beam of sunlight .  but other than that ( and some sexual innuendos ) , it's a perfect choice for some wholesome fun at the theaters .  i doubt many children will understand the sexual innuendos unless they are old enough , but it's still advisable to leave really young children at home .  have i confused you enough ?  if you do take your kids , i recommend seeing the film with them , because more than likely , you'll enjoy it the most .

1|"that's the question i asked myself when venturing nervously into "" the wedding singer , "" the latest film to star the saturday night live alumnus .  does he draw laughs from his sad , puppy dog expression and don't-hate-me-for-being-a-simpleton observations ?  or do fans giggle when he screams at the top of his lungs at people ?  or is it just the fact that he sings songs with silly lyrics that bowl audiences over ?  well , there's a little bit of all of that in "" the wedding singer "" and while i exited the theater still not one hundred percent sure of mr . sandler's thing , i did have a surprisingly good time .  that's because , in a nutshell , "" the wedding singer "" is one of the sweetest movies you're ever likely to come across .  that's right .  sweet .  the humor in the film runs the gamut from dumb to mildly amusing to laugh-out-loud hysterical but the tone ?  well , it's just lovely .  i have to admit i was half-expecting farting armpit humor , gratuitous nudity , superfluous , cloying subplots , and some nasty , unnecessary violence .  instead ?  well , i've said it before .  sweet .  the year is 1985 and sandler plays robbie hart , the eponymous wedding singer , a job aspiring rock stars often settle for .  when robbie's fianc ? e dumps him at his own altar , robbie gets depressed and turns to a plucky waitress called julia ( drew barrymore ) who has some problems of her own ( she's marrying a hunky junk bonds dealer who , unbeknownst to her , isn't that big on monogamy ) .  it isn't giving anything away to say that robbie and julia fall in love .  aww . . .  sandler and barrymore are a good match and they're assisted by some terrific cameo appearances , including steve buscemi and jon lovitz , whose individual scenes are perhaps the funniest in the film .  writer tim herlihy ( with uncredited assistance from carrie fisher ) keeps the story bubbling along to its predictable conclusion .  it doesn't all work but it's handled with such light-heartedness that robbie and julia coming together generates more smiles than groans .  herlihy and director frank coraci have done a great job of recreating the sights , sounds , and affectations of the 1980s .  the soundtrack--an ever-present force in the film--is packed with wall-to-wall hits of the period , new wave upon new wave of songs from billy idol's "" white wedding "" to the smiths' "" how soon is now ? ""  to culture club's "" do you really want to hurt me ? ""  the mix of music and fashion would make "" the wedding singer "" a great double feature with "" boogie nights .

1|"jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box-sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well-off .  maybe it's a classic case of displacement : it's easier to see jarvis' own lyrics ( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall ) as a fetishization of lowlife , rather than leigh's films .  but it's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working-class characters don't make for a guarantee of 'authenticity' , let alone a good film .  it's the triumph of secrets & lies , then , that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek 'authenticity' and honesty in everyday lives .  following her adopted mother's funeral , hortense , a young black optometrist , sets out to find her birth mother , and is disturbed to find out that she is white .  it is cynthia , a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne .  cynthia's younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages , largely because of his wife's animosity towards her .  hortense calls up cynthia , who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her .  but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually .  cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party , which maurice is hosting . . .  secrets & lies has a simple enough theme at its heart -- as one character puts it , "" best to tell the truth , isn't it ?  that way nobody gets hurt . "" .  but if the film delivers much more than a trite message , it's because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths , even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us .  hence , cynthia's difficulty with acknowledging ( first to herself , then to others ) that hortense is her daughter .  one of her first reactions to seeing hortense is a sincere denial that she has ever "" been with a black man "" , before a long-suppressed memory seizes her .  at the party , cynthia's pretense that hortense is her factory co-worker leads her to ever more convoluted lies , as agonizing as they are funny .  little lies seep into every corner , like maurice pretending that he's "" just dropping by "" when he visits cynthia after much deliberation .  maurice's job as a photographer gives the film opportunities for side comments on the main theme - a sad-looking bride that maurice coaxes to smile , a couple who pose awkwardly with a prominent wedding ring and argue about his spectacles .  one of the most startling images is of a beautiful woman with large scars on her face : she says she needs the photo to look "" as bad as possible "" to collect insurance money , yet the short scene leaves you wondering about what untold story lies behind the scars .  there are occasionally hilarious moments , as when cynthia attempts to give her daughter some unwelcome advice on contraception , "" i've got a dutch cap floating about somewhere upstairs "" ; or when cynthia stares at her own rather pedestrian legs and tells roxanne , "" if you've got it , flaunt it , is what i say . ""  as played by brenda blethyn , cynthia comes close to being a caricature , with her nervous , somewhat disconnected way of talking .  but she's really just right for the role of someone who inspires sympathy and yet strains the tolerance of those around her , precisely because she's so needy of love , perhaps .  indeed , the whole cast gives warmly rounded , detailed performances .  the script was developed partly through improvisations , and the fusion of cast , script and director shows best in the party scene - seemingly everyone is talking at the same time , and yet many subtle observations are being made throughout .  in a very different way , but also using a long single shot , the scene of hortense and cynthia's first meeting in a lonely caf=8a achieves a touching intensity , all the more for their reticence and unspoken feelings .  the film's climax - with all the secrets and lies finally spilled out in ibsen-esque revelations , and everybody hugging each other - is the one thing that seems false about this film .  however , it's a film that truly earns its happy ending after the misery and repression of the character's lives .  when cynthia says near the end , this is the life , innit ? , you get the sense that , following the cynicism of his last film naked , leigh has rediscovered that life can be sweet after all , without comforting illusions .  the flying inkpot's rating system : * wait for the video .   * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha !   * * * pretty good , bring a friend .   * * * * amazing , potent stuff .   * * * * * perfection .  see it twice .

1|"richard linklater's "" slacker , "" made in 1991 for a budget of only $23 , 000 , immerses itself in the twentysomething , college-town culture of austin , texas .  most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning .  their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation ; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy , the pervasiveness of slave morality , the subtle messages in pop culture , and such .  ask them what they've been doing lately , and they'll more likely than not reply , "" oh , you know , just hanging out . ""  linklater uses an interesting technique to examine these characters : the camera follows one person for a few minutes , then someone else walks by and the camera follows that person , who walks into a diner just as another person is walking out the door .   .   .   .  it's certainly a lot of fun listening to these characters talk : some of them are clearly very intelligent and have some genuinely insightful ideas , some of them are just plain weird , and some of them think their ideas are a lot more profound than they really are .  the opening monologue , delivered by linklater himself to a taxi driver , tosses around ideas about alternate realities that nicely set up the meandering structure of the film .  other characters along the way offer observations about everything from dating relationships to the history of anarchist philosophy , while groups of pseudo-intellectuals kick around ideas about the nobility of sitting around and doing nothing or the subtle bribery-based morality in "" scooby-doo . ""  for the most part , however , the best moments are the ones involving the slightly unhinged types .  near the beginning , a paranoid man follows a pedestrian for several blocks , warning him about government conspiracies involving everything from global warming to secret colonization of mars .  another man seems to be collecting televisions , keeping at least fifteen sets running at the same time and playing tapes of a graduate student who recorded himself having a nervous breakdown and destroying the camera .  and in a scene that drew a big laugh from everyone present when i saw the film , a man tries to achieve closure after a failed relationship by reciting poetry on a bridge and then throwing a typewriter into the creek below .  the only problem with "" slacker "" is that it starts to run out of steam towards the end .  since linklater only spends a few minutes with each character , the introduction of the new characters gets repetitive after a while .  there are only so many times you can hear , "" hey , what's going on ? ""   "" not much , what are you up to ? ""   "" nothing really , just hanging around , "" before it gets on your nerves ; the film might well have benefited from a slightly slower pace and a little bit more characterization .  and the dialogue in the second half of the film is by and large not quite as interesting as that in the first half ; a jfk buff , for example , seems like a pale imitation of the previous conspiracy theorist , and many of the characters just generally aren't as weird or unique .  instead of depicting a city populated by mostly normal people and then showing us the strangeness that we might not have noticed at first , linklater shows us the oddballs first , then stops and reminds us that ordinary people live there too .   "" slacker "" is a good film and a wonderfully offbeat and entertaining comedy , whatever its flaws , and its status as a cult classic is well-deserved .  i just can't help but think it might have been even better if linklater had slowed down a little bit and filmed these scenes in reverse order .

1|" "" a breed apart "" casts rutger hauer as a crazy , bird-loving recluse who picks his feathered friends over kathleen turner .  a bit hard to swallow ?  that's only the first of many improbabilities in this film .  hauer stars as a man obsessed with keeping the birds on his island safe , while boothe plays a guy hired to steal a couple of rare eagle eggs by a rich egg collector .  turner is the woman caught between the two men .   "" a breed apart "" isn't a bad movie , exactly .  indeed , i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters , even though their goals couldn't be more different .  the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies .  for example , early on in the film , hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at "" his "" birds .  later on , the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people , and hauer kills a few of them .  i have a tough time believing that the police wouldn't get involved at that point .  another problem is the silly love-triangle that develops .  i didn't care one way or the other who ended up with turner .  i was more interested in finding out which of the two men would be victorious in their respective missions .  however , despite this uninteresting sub-plot , turner did manage to give a great performance as the woman who reminds the two men that sometimes there's more to life than money and birds .  as for hauer , he's an actor i've always admired .  he has a penchant for picking strange and unusual characters .  and this one is no exception .  he's frequently seen riding around his island on a white horse , wearing pirate's clothing , and holstering a cross-bow .  despite all his eccentric mannerisms , though , hauer always manages to let the human side of his character shine through .  for example , there's a scene in which he barks at turner and her son because they came onto his island a day early .  he comes off as crazy loner in that scene , but a few minutes later , he is apologizing to turner , and we believe his intentions .  soon after , we find out he's a vietnam vet , and his actions become fairly clear to us .

1|titanic is so close to being the perfect movie it's upsetting that it isn't .  the film , which cost $200 million+ to make and could of put 20th century fox into a lot of finicial trouble if it 'sunk' ( pun intended ) is a labour of love for cameron , who wrote and directed the film .  we all know that big budget dosen't mean great film ( see waterworld ( 1995 ) ) but titanic is far superior to kevin costners waterlogged epic .  but sadly , titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece ( although it is one of cameron's best films )  the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic .  they find a safe , and inside a picture of a woman .  the woman in the picture ( an old winslet ) tells the explorers that the picture is of her .  the explorers invite her over , and she then tells her story of titanic .  in the flashback , dicaprio plays poor boy jack dawson , who , after winning a poker game , wins two tickets to board the grand ship titanic , leaving liverpool to go to america .  also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater ( winslet ) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all , cal hockley ( zane ) so her family can remain rich .  she nearly commits suicide on the ship , but jack comes to the rescue , saves rose , they fall in love , and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them .  oh yeah , and the ship sinks .  and that is the main problem with the film , and which stops it from being a work of genius .  the story and script ( both by cameron ) are both weak .  the story is full of cliched characters , ( the creepy man who the nice girl has to marry , the poor boy with heart , the stuck-up mother ) and poor dialogue ( the script consists of lots of in-jokes of how the boat won't sink , and most of the dialogue is pretty basic ) it's a shame really , as the audience does have to sit through 3 hours of this film .  without good dialogue , a film could become a very long , very boring film ( like camerons own terminator 2 , 1992 ) but , luckily , there are some redeeming features that make the story and dialogue problems just disappear .  firstly , there's cameron's direction .  there are some great sweeping shots of the titanic , and some clever fades between the flashback titanic and the ruined titanic .  but the scenes cameron directs especially well are the disaster scenes at the end .  there is a lot of mayhem and panic , all done very well by cameron .  it's a scary sight , watching bodies fall from great heights into the watery depths below .  thanks to cameron's direction , then , the audiences attention is held for the full 3 hours 15 minutes .  to support the directing are the excellent cast , working very well with their underwritten characters .  dicaprio is good , although he only looks 16-17 years old .  his performance of a over excitiable , yet also well mannered boy is excellent , and he also has some funny lines .  winslet is great also , and her transistion from a well mannered rich girl to a rebelous young adult is pretty smooth .  zane is deliciously evil as cal , saying every line with a sneer and a flicker of the eye lash .  the audience really does come to hate him .  he may be playing the same character he plays in every film he's in ( like dead calm , 1988 ) but he does it really , really well .  also worthy of note is kathy bates ( edward scissorhands , 1990 ) as a loud mouthed american .  finally , the icing on the 'great things' cake are the special effects .  cameron is a whiz with effects ( just watch aliens ( 1988 ) , terminator 2 and true lies , 1994 ) and they are used very well throughout .  the sweeps of the ships are awesome , although digital domain , who did the effects , cannot animate human movement too well .  the humans seem to move to 'smoothly' , there's just something odd about them .  you can tell that they have been animated on a computer .  of course , the ship sinking scenes are awesome , with bodies flying all over the place , and the scene where the ship splits in half has to be seen to be believed .  titanic is one of the only films where effects have reinforced the film .  titanic , then , is a wonder of directing , acting and cgi , but not writing and story .  again , like most of camerons films , the editing is loose ( cameron edits himself ) , and the film could of come in under three hours with a few more cuts .  titanic , then , although not the godfather of movies it could of been , is a wonderful attempt at creating a work of genius .  enjoyable , scary , and even sad , titanic is a film cinema was invented for , filling the screen with incredible images , and assaulting the ears with awesome sound .  a superb film , but sadly not perfect .  overall rating= (  |0.35000000000000003|0.7833333333333333|0.7333333333333334|The sentiment of the explanations is generally positive, with praise for James Cameron's directing, the cast performances, and the special effects.

1|"on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements ( in case you missed it , warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail .  he says to a black congregation "" . . . if you can't cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife , you're never gonna get rid of me . "" )  well , there is such a plot , and it works very well in this comedy .  beatty plays jay billington bulworth , a long-time democratic senator from california .  the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth's latest commercials condemning affirmative action .  the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy .  when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv , having gone without food or sleep for days .  his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care .  first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe - a $10 million life insurance policy in his daughter's name .  then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination .  his assistant murphy ( oliver platt ) is oblivious to bulworth's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements .  bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african-american church , then takes questions from the audience .  he is hit hard with questions about his voting record .  he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots , and it hasn't shown up .  since he's a dead man anyway , he figures he'll answer truthfully : he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l . a . for the photo opportunity .  they made some promises that improved their public image for a while , and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made .  the shock and outrage from the congregation grows , the questions keep coming , and he keeps shooting back honest , if ugly , answers .   ( before i go further , i'd like to make a distinction that the denver post failed to make , and that is that characterizing african-americans as malt-liquor drinking o . j .  fans is not part of bulworth's "" truth . ""  that line is in the trailers but it should not be praised like the other political confessions he makes in the movie .  when the critics praise beatty for speaking the truth about politics , this line is not what they're talking about . )  the experience is liberating .  with nothing left to lose , bulworth is no longer restricted to burping generic platitudes out of both sides of his mouth .  he can say whatever he wants because he's going to be dead anyway .  why not tell the people the truth about being a sleazy politician - that he is bought and paid for by lobbyists , and that racism among the populace protects politicians from being the target of charges of classism ?  bulworth's candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on .  he feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something .  chicken wings , appropriately enough .  bulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives .  when one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment .  with so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can't hollywood make a quality product .

1|"the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy .  but after diasappointing films such as "" godzilla "" and "" fear and loathing in las vegas "" , it would be nice to see a really good film .  but i doubt you could have expected this .  the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen , and it deserves a spot on the "" decade's best "" list .  there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim , "" yes , that's what makes this film great . ""  the blend of peter weir's masterful ( and in many ways brilliant ) direction , peter biziou's stunning photography and jim carrey's performance is what makes this film work so fantastically .  there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show .  it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame , but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect .  carrey has made a very wise choice .  by playing mild-mannered truman burbank , he allows himself enough room to be comical , and therefore not alienating his true fans , while still showing a vulnerable and human side .  that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes .  truman burbank was born to an audience of millions .  he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show .  everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians , led by the show's director , christof ( played by ed harris ) .  everyone in truman's life is an actor or an extra .  they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe , people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman's life .  but he is the only person that is not aware of it .  the classification of the truman show may be tricky .  the audience reacted to many of truman's revelations with laughter .  i did not laugh much during the film because i was so emotionally wrapped up with the character .  the things that made the audience laugh gave me glassy eyes , because what was happening to him , indeed what had been done to him his whole life was wrong .  so is this going to end up labeled as a comedy ?  a drama ?  it really depends on the audience .  but to me , the truman show was a touching , sad tale about the extents to which a corporation will go to exploit human life for the entertainment of others .  but above all else , the truman show was a stunningly beautiful picture with humor , heart and scary realism .  oscar predictions in june are pointless , but if the truman show had been released on schedule in late fall or winter of 1997 , as originally planned , james cameron would be oscar-less .

1|one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length .  if a film is only 90 minutes , but feels like 300 minutes , then it's crap .  but if a film last 2 1/2 hours , and feels like 90 minutes , then it's excellent .  boogie nights falls into the latter catagory .  the director , anderson , delivers a funny , hip , yet sometimes violent film , which flies along .  mark whalberg , a . k . a  marky mark , plays eddie adams , a seventeen year old with a certain 'gift' in the midriff area .  jack horner ( reynolds ) is a adult film director , who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business .  after running away from home , eddie joins jack , changes his name to dirk diggler , and starts making erotic movies .  in the movie business , dirk meets a whole load of characters ( which the film introduces very quickly and slickly ) such as scotty ( phillip seymour hoffman ) , rollergirl ( graham ) amber ( moore ) and floyd ( phillip baker hall ) , and little bill ( william h . macy ) all the characters are well written , well played , and the audience gets to know them pretty well , thanks to the excellent script .  we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce , rollergirls hard time at school , and little bills wife , who sleeps with everyone except her husband .  but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing .  the direction is fast , thrilling , and never holds up .  there are some great shots , some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences , and lots of other neat directional touches .  the writing is fabulous , with some intelligent dialogue , some funny dialogue , but none of the dialogue is crap , like most hollywood films ( such as the lost world : jurassic park ( 1997 ) , or tommorow never dies ( 1997 ) . )  boogie nights really is a spectacular feat of direction and writing , on par ( and sometimes betters ) quentin tarantino's films resevoir dogs ( 1992 ) and pulp fiction ( 1994 )  the soundtrack is also excellent .  like american graffiti ( 1973 ) , the film features some great old songs on the soundtrack , which heightens the atmosphere , and gives the film an extra lift .  also , the costumes are great .  the clothes really do look like what people wore in the seventies and eighties .  the film , although excellent , does have some flaws .  firstly , wahlberg , although excellent , cannot do highly scenes which require him to be angry .  in both scenes where he has to act angry , his acting is so 'off' , the scenes tension and anger is lost .  but the rest of the cast are excellent .  burt reynolds is brilliant , julianne moore shows real emotion , and william h . macy is great aswell ( but he always is . )  another flaw with the film , though , is that the ending seems a bit tacked on .  it seems anderson saw the film was going on a bit , and needed to wrap up quickly .  it's a shame , really , as the rest of the film is perfectly paced .  but they're small niggles really .  boogie nights is an excellent film .  superb directing , writing , acting and music , all combine to make one spectacular film .  whatever you do , do not miss out on boogie nights .  |0.709|0.8333333333333334|0.8833333333333334|"Overall, the sentiment of the text is positive, with the reviewer highly praising the direction, writing, acting, and music of the film ""Boogie Nights"" despite some minor flaws being mentioned."
1|"it's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director's cut of the film .  films such as aliens , the abyss , the wild bunch , blade runner , and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker's integrity , later chopped up or mucked with by the studio .  the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films .  the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson's 1995 masterpiece the professional , which is known as l ? on around the world , is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic as a director's cut .  for years , i have heard of an "" international "" version available only in laserdisc format , which has eluded me for years .  i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors' cuts - including l ? on .  but after countless searches in laserdisc stores , i could never find it .  until now .  the film follows the story of l ? on , played by jean reno , a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello .  he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year-old girl named mathilda - played by then newcomer natalie portman , whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops .  one day , a crew of the cops - lead by gary oldman in an over-the-top performance - kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries .  taking pity on her , l ? on hides her in his apartment when she returns to save her life .  mathilda learns of l ? on's hit man profession and decides to follow in l ? on's footsteps as a "" cleaner . ""  she then falls in love with him and manages to reawaken emotions within l ? on he has kept locked away as part of his profession .  at this point , the differences in the american version and the international version really kick in .  the international version contains an additional 24 minutes of footage that pertains directly to the relationship of l ? on and mathilda , footage that american censors deemed "" too explicit . ""  i assume that american censors feel that defining character development is too much for american audiences to handle .  the best part of this extra footage is that gives better understanding of both mathilda's and l ? on's motivations pertaining to later actions involving oldman and his crew of bad cops .  there's even a previously unseen cameo by the great french actor jean-hugues anglade - star of queen margot , besson's la femme nikita , and killing zoe .  with these additional scenes replaced , l ? on and matilda's relationship brings you emotionally closer to the film and draws stronger bonds between the characters that were murky in the american version .  the most ironic thing about the international version of the film is that with the inclusion of the missing scenes , the film becomes primarily a heavy , emotional drama punctuated with big action scenes at the beginning and the end of the film .  the film betters reflects the serious drama of french cinema but is laced with pieces reflecting the brutality of american cinema .  my advice to everyone out there is to throw away your copy of the professional , throw down twenty bucks , and pick up this newly restored cinematic masterpiece .  director/writer : luc besson producer : luc besson , claude besson starring : jean reno , natalie portman , gary oldman , danny aiello  "|0.5666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|0.7833333333333333|"The explanations express a positive sentiment towards the original director's cuts of films and the additional footage in the international version of ""The Professional"", emphasizing improved character development and emotional connection.

1|"while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general .  words "" croatia "" and "" croatians "" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations .  the rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth's bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context .  in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise .  same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime .  the movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe .  his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro .  shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away .  after being arrested and tortured by kimba's secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) .  upon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d'etat against kimba .  shannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war .  thing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary .  it shouldn't surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books .  those plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman's the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre .  this one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires .  unlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work .  the movie doesn't try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda .  christopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role .  his performance in this film perhaps isn't breathtaking , yet adequate .  his notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the "" normal "" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends .  although the movie doesn't lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken's , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character .  however , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon's reluctant colleague .  this was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director .  with the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess .  luckily , the dogs of war had a good script .  irvin's direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel .  the only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places .  in the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes .  unfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn't help .  but , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama .

""  she argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored .  geoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company's higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can't wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life .  while out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area .  in the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything .  the scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david's view but coming at it from a much different angle .  it was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies .  that the director's point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point .  the point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters .  geoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty .  alex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex's apartment .  geoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him .  the relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely .  the dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies .  the only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david's loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city .  the farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist's lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way .  what is progress ?  what can one expect out of life ?  is the small farmer about to become extinct ?  the answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way .  that this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white .  no telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic .  there is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don't like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically .  that is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference .  the stakes in this ecological struggle are that high .  perhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene .  it was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso's guernica had for him .  both artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on .  the pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , "" make the world go away "" blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science .  perhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?

because it doesn't feature slick one-liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80's .  however , you have been missing out on a true masterpeice , the best film of 1986 , and the best film about adolescent life ever made .  corey haim stars as lucas bligh , a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair , thick glasses , and an interest in insects and other outdoor life .  one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him .  her name is maggie , a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty , with lovely red hair and a sweet , innocent complexion .  maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her , but somehow he interests her , and soon they are talking and getting to know one another .  they gradually become good friends , and spend the summer together doing various things , such as studying insects ( namely locusts , who come out of hiding once every 17 years ) , playing tennis , and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover .  lucas is obviously in love with maggie , and while she is charmed by him , it's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend .  this is not clear to lucas , however .  he still beleives that maggie is his soulmate , and he dreads the impending start of school because he knows what's about to happen .  we soon find out why in a painful scene where lucas is humiliated by the jocks during a pep rally .  they throw him on stage , right in front of his beloved maggie .  surprisingly , he turns the tables on the jocks with some clowning around , but he takes it too far , and is embarassed in front of the entire school .  the next scene is brilliant .  maggie follows lucas outside of the pep rally .  she tries to talk to him as if nothing happened .  he rails back against her , in a cruel unfair fashion .  in lesser movies this would've turned into a confrontation between the two characters .  but maggie is written smarter than that .  she understands what lucas is feeling and knows exactly what to say to console him .  next we are introduced to another great character named cappie ( charlie sheen ) .  he is a jock with a typical cheerleader girlfriend .  what's interesting about him is that he sticks up for lucas and protects him from the other jocks .  of course anyone with a brain can tell what's gonna happen next .  cappie will cause conflict in maggie and lucas' relationship .  this begins in classic scene in the school laundry room when cappie and maggie are alone .  she's been assigned to show him how to operate the washer/dryer so he can clean his shirt .  maggie is charmed by cappie's tender undertsanding demeanor , not to mention his shirtless body .  this scene is so delicate and sweet , but cappie still has a girlfriend , preventing either one from acting on their desires .  desperately trying to puncture the tension , cappie begins to kick basketballs around the room .  it's not long before cappie does break up with his girlfriend ( in the films only subpar scene ) .  lucas finally figures out what's going on when he tries to pick maggie up for the dance .  this causes him to take severe actions to prove himself to maggie and himself , such as try out for the football team .  the last third of the film revolves around this attempt .  while the idea seems cliched , the way it is executed is not .  there are many surprises during the last half hour which lead to an ending so emotionally involving it should make the most heartless of cynics get choked up .  dave grusin's memorable score , played at the perfect moments , certainly helps .  lucas is filled with great performances .  forget everything you know about corey haim .  back in 1986 he had talent , and that is proven here as he delivers a perfect fully 3-dimensional performance filled with anger , humor , and pain .  kerri green is very appealing as maggie , showing us why she cares about lucas so much and why he is so attracted to her .  sheen's cappie is almost too good to be true , but sheen makes him beleivable , especially when he explains the reason why he protects lucas .  there are other wonderful minor characters such as ciro popitti's ben , a friend of lucas , whose diminutive stature does not mean he will take crap from the jocks .  also turning up in a few key scenes is winona ryder as rina , the girl who admires lucas from afar .  when people talk about the great teen angst films of the 80s , you hear john hughes this and john hughes that .  lucas seems to be lost among the crowd of his so-called classics .  but hopefully , like with heathers and say anything , lucas can begin to find it's own loyal following and help people realize there were more to the 80s than anthony michael hall and molly ringwald .  it deserves more than that , but i don't want to be greedy .  |0.7600000000000001|0.8666666666666667|0.85|"The

1|in arguably the most anticipated movie this century , george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster .  despite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down , the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence , in the sound and special effects department .  in terms of characters , by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age .  she is one ? hot' babe who defines true ? woman leadership' .  she not only has a presence , but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination .  no thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force , lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything .  the young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) who has a bad hair day in every scene , gets to kill a bad guy in the end , but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero .  in fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual - there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners .  i mean it would be interesting to see yoda's girlfriend for a change , if he has one .  not much better is qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) who mostly broods , and has a better hair do than obi-wan , but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life .  also fascinating is george lucas ? metoclorian' theory , which claims that micro-organisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe .  and it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force .  more humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader , no doubt a concept stolen from the christian faith , except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force .  overall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that it's predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior successor .  by all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan .  watch out for the next one , it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker - who i believe should be portrayed by ? leonardo di caprio .  |-0.08800000000000001|0.8183333333333334|0.7833333333333333|The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly negative due to the negative comments about the script, plot, and characterization of the Jedi Knights, which outweigh the positive mentions of technical excellence and the performance of Queen Amidala.
1|"felix ( sami bouajila , "" the siege "" ) lives a contented life with his boyfriend daniel ( pierre-loup rajot ) in the little town of dieppe in northern france .  when he is laid off from his job , after discovering the address of the father who abandoned him before he was born , he decides to journey to marseilles , in the south , to find the man he never met in "" the adventures of felix . ""  writers/directors olivier ducastel and jacques martineau made their debut with the musical comedy "" jeanne and the perfect guy , "" embracing that typically american genre .  their second effort , "" the adventures of felix , "" once again borrows from america with a tale of a young man who hits the road to find himself .  felix is happy with his life in dieppe , but when the ferry company he works for falls prey to the economics of the chunnel , he is out of a job and at loose ends .  when he goes through his late mother's papers he learns that the father he never knew is living in marseilles , hundreds of miles away .  felix makes the snap decision to journey to the south , puts together a supply of "" cocktails "" for his hiv virus , kisses daniel goodbye and heads off on foot .  he refuses to use trains and wants to avoid big cities as he hitchhikes across france to find his destiny .  along the way , a series of chance encounters with various strangers teaches felix that family is not always made up of blood relations .  on the road , he witnesses a race-related mugging that turns into murder and , frightened for his own safety , runs away without telling the police .  following this harrowing experience , he has his first chance meeting that begins the unconscious construction of his ideal family .  his journey brings him to rouen , and the film's first title section , "" my little brother , "" where he meets jules , a young art student who becomes smitten with felix .  they steal a car and develop a chaste , brotherly affection before felix must move on .  he next meets elderly mathilde ( patachou ) , in the chapter titled "" my grandmother , "" and soon learns that she , too , has a fondness for the same tv soap opera that felix has grown addicted to .  she wants him to stay with her , but he must continue on his way to find his father .  in the weakest chapter of felix's road trip , titled "" my cousin , "" he meets a railroad worker ( philippe garziano ) and has a brief sexual encounter before heading off , once again , toward marseilles .  he next helps a stranded lady motorist , isabelle ( ariane ascaride ) , and shags a ride with her and her three kids ( each with a different daddy ) in the sequence titled "" my sister . ""  he is torn by the inner turmoil of not going to the police about the murder he witnessed and isabelle comforts him just as a sister would .  on the final leg of the journey titled "" my father , "" he meets an older man , a fisherman ( maurice benichou ) , who enlightens him about the real facts of life and family while they fly felix's kite , just like a father and son .   "" the adventures of felix "" has a number of things going for it as we follow felix on his journey of discovery .  first and foremost is the charming performance by sami bouajila as felix .  he is a likable guy , fighting his hiv with his doses of "" cocktails , "" and lights up the screen as he makes the long walk , often with dance and song , to find his father and himself .  as he encounters each member of his new family , promising each that he will send a postcard when he arrives at his final destination , he grows a little bit more spiritually and emotionally .  bouajila does a terrific job holding center stage on the screen .  the cast of characters making up felix's new-found family are nearly as charming as the star , each in their own way .  patachou , especially , is wonderful as the grandma character and a kindred spirit to felix .  ariane ascaride , along with her kids , gives a perf that really makes you think of her as the sister that the young man never had .  only the "" cousin "" chapter lacks the emotional depth of the rest and feels like a perfunctory addition to felix's "" family . ""   "" the adventures of felix "" does not reinvent the road movie , but it does provide a charismatic telling of a young man's journey to find himself and , to his surprise , his discovery is dramatically different than he expected at the beginning .  it helps that cinematographer matthieu poirot-delpech's crisp lensing compliments the story perfectly as felix moves across the french countryside .  i give it a b+ .

1|"i know that "" funnest "" isn't a word .   "" fun "" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective .  but that's the word that came to me right after viewing "" chicken run . ""  no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like "" that was the funnest movie i've ever seen ! ""  so to hell with webster's -- "" chicken run "" is one of the funnest movies i've seen in a while .  i can't remember the last time i've seen anything funner .  the chickens at tweedy's farm are up to something .  living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box .  one night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer .  rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm's egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan .  she orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , "" chickens go in ; pies come out . ""  what sort of pies ?  chicken pies , of course .  co-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : "" creature comforts , "" "" the wrong trousers , "" and "" a close shave . ""  the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures .  part of what made the "" wallace "" films brilliantly entertaining was park's uncanny ability to make an old story seem new .   "" the wrong trousers , "" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and "" a close shave "" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories .  but in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived .  now teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in "" chicken run . ""  the plot is largely lifted from "" the great escape "" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement .  thing is , the film doesn't feel like it's been lifted from somewhere else ; "" chicken run "" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done .  part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ?  park and lord milk the incongruity for all it's worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is .  but they're * chickens * , so it's funny to us .  another thing that helps "" chicken run "" ( and most of park's films ) succeed is the animators' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they're cribbing .  there are references to "" the great escape , "" obviously , and "" stalag 17 . ""  the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both "" raiders of the lost ark "" and "" indiana jones and the temple of doom . ""  there's even a nod to "" the blues brothers , "" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson's nationality and film history .  the "" braveheart "" reference is a hoot if you catch it .  when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , "" chicken run "" is downright brilliant in its execution .  consider this : since july of last year , i've seen dozens upon dozens of "" blair witch project "" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online .  out of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome .  why ?  because once you got past the thought that "" they're parodying that 'blair witch' movie , "" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose .  they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing .  conversely , "" chicken run "" doesn't lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene .  if you've never seen "" indiana jones , "" the chase sequence is still fun .  even if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character .  park , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it's understood , and as a result , "" chicken run "" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either .  enjoyment of this movie doesn't require knowledge of film history , but if you've got it , "" chicken run "" is that much richer .  the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it's hard not to fall in love with every one of them .  ginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on "" absolutely fabulous "" ) nails it .  she has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer .  the characters' inevitable romance doesn't feel contrived , but sweet .  poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn't any help .  jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence .  they even come up with an inspired riff on something that's baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma .  one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of "" chicken run , "" it comes as a delightful surprise .  the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens .  the animation is first-rate .  remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable "" chicken run "" really is .  this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail .  as in such top-notch family fare as "" a bug's life "" or "" toy story 2 , "" "" chicken run "" has something to offer in nearly every frame .  certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they'll catch all the details .  anyway , the movie's just a boatload of fun .  funnest damn movie i've seen all year .
