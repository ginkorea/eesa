0|there may not be a critic alive who harbors as much affection for shlock monster movies as i do .  i delighted in the sneaky-smart entertainment of ron underwood's big-underground-worm yarn tremors ; i even giggled at last year's critically-savaged big-underwater-snake yarn anaconda .  something about these films causes me to lower my inhibitions and return to the saturday afternoons of my youth , spent in the company of ghidrah , the creature from the black lagoon and the blob .  deep rising , a big-undersea-serpent yarn , doesn't quite pass the test .  sure enough , all the modern monster movie ingredients are in place : a conspicuously multi-ethnic/multi-national collection of bait . . . excuse  me , characters ; an isolated location , here a derelict cruise ship in the south china sea ; some comic relief ; a few cgi-enhanced gross-outs ; and at least one big explosion .  there are too-cheesy-to-be-accidental elements , like a sleazy shipping magnate ( anthony heald ) who also appears to have a doctorate in marine biology , or a slinky international jewel thief ( famke janssen ) whose white cotton tank top hides a heart of gold .  as it happens , deep rising is noteworthy primarily for the mechanical manner in which it spits out all those ingredients .  a terrorist crew , led by squinty-eyed mercenary hanover ( wes studi ) and piloted by squinty-eyed boat captain finnegan ( treat williams ) , shows up to loot the cruise ship ; the sea monsters show up to eat the mercenary crew ; a few survivors make it to the closing credits .  and up go the lights .  it's hard to work up much enthusiasm for this sort of joyless film-making , especially when a monster moview should make you laugh every time it makes you scream .  here , the laughs are provided almost entirely by kevin j . o'connor , generally amusing as the crew's fraidy-cat mechanic .  writer/director stephen sommers seems most concerned with creating a tone of action-horror menace -- something over-populated with gore-drenched skeletons , something where the gunfire and special effects are taken a bit too seriously .  deep rising is missing that one unmistakable cue that we're expected to have a ridiculous good time , not hide our eyes .  case it point , comparing deep rising to its recent cousin anaconda .  in deep rising , one of the creature's victims is regurgitated back into view , partially digested and still alive .  he shrieks in horror at his freakish appearance and pain , in a moment a bit too disturbing to be laughable .  in anaconda , we also see a regurgitated victim , partially digested and still alive .  he looks at another character . . . and  winks .  make no mistake , deep rising has anaconda beat all to heck when it comes to technical proficiency and pacing .  it's also gloomy , uninspired and not nearly enough fun .  i don't ask much of my monster movies , but i do ask that they act like monster movies .  you don't have to show me a fantastically impressive , massive beast with tentacles a-flailing .  just show me the massive beast burping , and i'll figure you get the point .  |-0.5166666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666667|"The overall sentiment is slightly negative with the author expressing disappointment in ""Deep Rising"" for lacking humor, entertainment, and enjoyment compared to other monster movies like ""Anaconda.""

0|there're so many things to criticize about i don't know where to start .  recommendation : turn off your brain - don't be like me , decreasing the rating everyday because i think about it too much .  a comet is about to strike earth , causing a catastrophe similar to the extinction level event ( e . l . e . ) that wiped out the dinosaurs .  what follows is the story of a president's bid to think for the good of his people , a rising reporter , the love story of two teenagers ( one of whom discovered the comet ) , and a team of astronauts on the ship `messiah' to save the world .  firstly , there is nothing outstandingly inferior about the making of the film ( nor is there anything outstandingly good about it ) , but the plot holes make the film corny and stupid .  to be honest , i was more moved by the trailer than the film itself ( which isn't saying much ) .  mimi leder's follow-up to `the peacemaker' is equally incompetent , with all the big stars wasted .   ( perhaps i'm just annoyed that the release of `the peacemaker' in the us overshadowed a far superior thriller , `the assignment' . )  it is very obvious that the title not only represents the big boom that will result from the collision , but also connotes the heavy impact on human lives .  however , the film simply fails on that note .  the effects are worn-out , the substandard screenplay limited the acting , and the director continued her sad run in terms of good-film-making credentials .  she's still making good money though .  t ? a leoni's unfortunate character , the news reporter , is the foundation of the story and of the cast .  but the film suffers from too many characters that do not need to be explored .  robert duvall's aging astronaut is lifeless , and morgan freeman's president is restricted to , well , a righteous president ( which means he's not interesting at all ) .  leoni's character is the only appealing one , and is played with reasonable conviction ( but a rather peculiar showing when reporting for msnbc ) , but was definitely undervalued by the director and screenwriters .  warning : spoilers included ( but a lot of it is irrelevant and predictable anyway ) .  plot holes , plot holes , plot holes .  now , e . l . e .  is threatening to exterminate more than 99% of the human race , and they send eight puny little nuclear bombs up there ?  where's the logic ?  leder could have at least made it plausible with 20 .  and then it turns out that only a few percent of the world population actually perish , and those less selfish ones ( the ones that stayed at home ) were the victims .  the film was almost mocking them , telling them they had died for nothing .  i also fail to see how two teenagers , carrying a baby , would be the first to climb up the mountain/hill , even with a motorbike for a head-start .  it's unlikely that the dust will take just two years to settle , but that doesn't really matter .  building caves was a strategy mentioned in `dr .  strangelove' , which proposed that people lived underground for one hundred or so years .  now that is a more practical use for caves .  what is the point of living in caves ?  there is no , unlike `dr .  strangelove' , any radioactivity outside to restrict exposure .  how do plants grow ?  if humans have the technology to keep plants alive in caves , there's no reason why they can't do it in the open .  the president disclosed that other countries have been preparing their own caves .  obviously this means that the other countries were informed a long time ago , and you can't be serious to say that nobody leaked the news to the media .  in an important mission like that of the `messiah' , for that matter any mission , it is impossible that isn't sufficient fuel for an extra couple of hundred metres , needless to say tens of kilometres .  this is not deep impact ? it's a frivolous cheap impact .  but even with all that , some overacting , and a 3 . 4 rating , it's still watchable , just don't think about it .  okay ?  |-0.7166666666666667|0.85|0.9|The overall sentiment of the explanations is that the text is highly negative, criticizing various aspects of the film including the plot holes, screenplay, and wasted talent, expressing disappointment and frustration with the film's execution.

0|don't let this movie fool you into believing the romantic noirs of william shakespeare .  no one will truly understand the heart and soul of this man except through his work , and this movie makes a vain attempt at that .  any moves to ? glamorise' his life , which hollywood has an annoying tendency to do , will only subtract from his achievement rather than expound on his greatness .  this movie about his life , although well written , puts too much make-up on a man whose life was probably more pork and potatoes , rather than lobster and champagne .  oh well , let's fantasise onwards an assume that he was a bit of a flirtatious play-write , who falls in love with a beautiful woman ( gwyneth paltrow ) and from her inspiration , several plays develop - ? romeo and juliet' , and ? the twelfth night' .  it is easier for me to believe that he had a wet dream and that's how all his plays develop , but please spare me all of this unnecessary melodrama .  but i guess my version probably wouldn't draw a crowd or make a dollar on screen .  so is there any justification in romanticising the man shakespeare , when all we need to do is read his work in order to find his soul .  i think not .  as for the oscars were they deserved by this movie ?  i think not .  in many aspects ? private ryan' and ? life is beautiful' were far superior movies , but one should never assume that this should be a criteria for winning an oscar , as time and again , for reasons unexplained , an undeserving movie will win the accolade .  another sore point is the fact that gwyneth won the best female lead , over a more polished cate , but i guess if you go on enough about your grandfather dying and your nephew being hospitalised - people will start feeling sorry for you .  |-0.6166666666666667|0.8000000000000002|0.8333333333333334|The explanations express a negative sentiment towards the movie about William Shakespeare's life, criticizing its glamorization of Shakespeare and questioning the justification for romanticizing him.

0|"writing a screenplay for a thriller is hard .  harder than pouring concrete under the texas sun .  harder than building a bridge over troubled waters .  and incidentally , a whole heck of a lot harder than writing a movie review .  thrillers are all variations on a theme .  you have a smart , resourceful , and powerful bad guy , who has a goal he has to meet .  you have a noble and brave good guy , who has to protect the innocent , kill the bad guy , and not get killed himself in the process .  the trick of thriller writing is doing all of this in an interesting and novel manner .  this simple formula can lead to classic movies like north by northwest , high noon , or silence of the lambs , or big summer blockbusters like men in black , the fugitive , or air force one , or it can lead to utter dreck like masterminds , event horizon , kull the conqueror . . . .  is anyone else getting depressed here ?  point is , it's not enough to follow the formula .  you've got to throw in something extra , something good and new and better than the last version .  something to surprise and move all of us people who buy the tickets and the popcorn and the happy meals .  this is a hard thing to do , but it is absolutely necessary in every way .  without that something extra -- whether it's a great plot or a well-written screenplay , or great special effects or great locations or great casting or great performances or great big hungry dinosaurs -- the movie fails .  that's why the jackal , with all its starpower , with all its budget , with all its hype , gets a big fat f .  bruce willis is the bad guy , the jackal , a legendary killer for hire .  richard gere is the good guy , a former ira assassin with a vendetta against the jackal .  the jackal is trying to kill someone .  gere is trying to stop him .  will gere be able to stop the assassination in time and kill the jackal ?

0|all right , all right , we get the point : despite all similarities to the best-selling story , speechless is * not * based on the romance between 1992 presidential campaign rivals james carville and mary matalin .  in fact , the script was in development well before 1992 .  still , the comparisons are inevitable , until one realizes a critical difference .  no , it's not that the speechless twosome are speech writers , not campaign managers ; it's that carville and matalin's story is actually interesting .  speechless is a limp , poorly structured would-be romantic comedy .  speechless is set during a new mexico senatorial campaign , where kevin vallick ( michael keaton ) and julia mann ( geena davis ) meet and get romantic one night when neither one can sleep .  what neither one realizes is that they are on opposite sides of the campaign : kevin is a sit-com writer brought in to punch up the republican candidate's speeches , while julia is the chief speech writer for the democratic candidate .  at first each one believes that the other has an ulterior motive for the relationship , but eventually they let down their guard and become closer .  but there are plent of obstacles in the way , including julia's stud-reporter fiance ( christopher reeve ) and a series of stunts which continue to prove that all's fair in love and politics .  the standard formula for a movie like speechless would have the two principles starting out as antagonists and realizing only at the end that they're crazy about each other .  screenwriter robert king completely subverts expectations by throwing kevin and julia into each other's arms in the first fifteen minutes , then developing the antagonism .  it's a noble attempt to shake things up , but unfortunately it just doesn't work .  part of the fun of watching sparring in a romantic comedy comes from recognizing the chemistry even before the characters do , but in speechless they already know they're attracted to each other , and we're left with waiting for the campaign to end so they'll admit that they love each other already .  there is such a herky-jerky feel to the constant bickering and making up that even king's sharp dialogue can't prevent speechless from becoming repetitive after about half an hour .  inconsistency is also the defining characteristic of the performances of geena davis and michael keaton , and with those performances most of their scenes together .  the problems begin with their initial courtship , which does virtually nothing to establish julia's character and merely establishes that kevin is a wise-ass .  davis is radiantly beautiful , and keaton is generally entertaining , but these characters are so plastic that nothing that happens to them seems to matter one bit .  in a couple of scenes , like a quiet moment sitting at a fountain , they actually achieve some measure of connection .  for the most part , however , they're just actors spouting lines .  you keep waiting for a little spark , and it never happens .  perhaps most disappointing is that king and director ron underwood completely waste their premise by removing all the punch from speechless's politics .  the setting seems perfect for a high- energy battle of the sexes with partisanship thrown into the mix , but that's never the tone that underwood is going for .  he wants a warm , fuzzy romance compatible with marc shaiman's flute-and-wind musical score , and the campaign which should have defined the conflict between kevin and julia fades into the background .  it might as well have been a story about rival grocers , and every single character is about as uninspired as he or she could possibly be .  i was about the only reviewer in the civilized world who seemed to enjoy robert king's previous screenplay , the dana carvey flop clean slate , so i had some hopes for speechless .  but while there is wit in the words , this is a script which was probably much better on paper .  on screen , it's still paper thin .  |-0.4666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|0.8000000000000002|"The movie ""Speechless"" is described as a poorly structured romantic comedy with inconsistent performances, lacking depth and connection between characters, and wasted potential in exploring its political setting.

0|"teenagers have a lot of power in hollywood .  every year countless films will be made targeting that audience in particular , and rely on the entire teenage population to turn out on friday and saturday nights , wallets in hand .  the formula is very simple , you make a film with a big name young actor or actress with sex appeal .  you add a high school environment that features everyone from prom queens to math club nerds , and then a very simple relationship conflict that can be worked out in 90 minutes , the typical teenage attention span .  the response is enormous as this part of the population will waste it92s money on almost any = film set in an environment they can relate to , and , most importantly , they don92t care to judge films=92 quality , so any piece of trash will = due .  that is just what never been kissed , the latest film from director raja gosnell , is ; trash .  josie geller ( drew barrymore ) is the youngest copy editor in the history of the chicago sun times .  she has her own personal assistant , unlimited supplies , and her own office .  but she is very much dismayed with her position in life .  there is nothing she wants more than to be a reporter and go out into the field , where she can play a more active role in the chicago media .  so when an assignment is quite literally thrown at her out of nowhere , she jumps at it with elation .  constantly smothering josie in the work place is her friend anita ( molly shannon ) and her amicable superior , gus ( john c . reilly ) .  the two of them are both stricken with horror upon hearing the news of her first assignment , as they both deem her to be an office worker and not a reporter .  however , since this film is aimed at a teenage audience with little patience for character conflict , this otherwise interesting scenario is resolved within two minutes , and josie is headed for the field .  obviously , the field assignment involves a high school .  specifically , she is to become an undercover reporter at a high school , by enrolling in the senior class and "" becoming one of them . ""  i don92t think that i = need to even begin to explain all the impossibilities of this situation ever occurring , so i won92t .  the movie develops into josie trying to find the life that she never led in high school .  interwoven flashback scenes show us just how much of a dork she truly was , and she appears to be heading down that road again .  fortunately for this lame production , other characters do appear that make some of these high school scenes both humorous and remotely interesting .  they include the predictable love stories , between both a student ( jeremy jordan ) and a teacher ( michael vartan ) , to show that josie is really two people in one body .  also , her younger brother and opposite , rob ( david arquette ) comes into her new found life and even causes a rare scene that is mildly provocative .  the humor found in this film is actually quite amusing .  typical for teenage films , it is chalk full of sexual innuendoes and condom humor .  one scene in particular features a certain classroom activity involving bananas and latex that is absolutely hysterical .  most of the other jokes are straight forward high school humor that anyone who has ever been to high school can appreciate and will enjoy .  but those still don92t = recover for the total lack of quality in this movie .  following this trend of high school movie rules , comes the general acting .  it is even worse than the trend of overplaying a scenario from film to film .  in this case , drew barrymore is absolutely painful to watch .  she is required to play her character on two levels , having some very black and white transitions .  and although some scenes are written to be particular shades of gray , she seems to hold that color throughout all of her screen time .  at one point she is alone with an obvious love interest on a ferris wheel , and is expected to him on an adult level , since he is one , her teacher .  but she never seems to get out of the gray area , and in doing so she makes a mockery out of his otherwise good performance .  following barrymore is the pitiful molly shannon ( saturday night live ) .  she seems to be limited to playing an ecstatic character that no one can relate to , and draws the attention of an audience as simply unrealistic .  it is these "" qualities "" that prevent the aforementioned condom scene from being one of the few decent .  luckily there is one great performance to emerge out of this otherwise bleak film .  david arquette ( scream ) takes home the prize for being able to stand out in an ensemble performance that is absolutely pathetic , and not have his brilliant acting ruined .  and as a central character he gets to take on his own mini-plot , which is one of the few well done parts of never been kissed .  in a dazzling cherry-on-the-sundae type piece of work , he does an absolutely hilarious tom cruise impression from the 1983 hit , risky business .  never been kissed is a mediocre film at best .  the predictable plot has become so overplayed in hollywood , that it is sickening to watch time and again , and this film is no exception .  the acting is just as bad , but there is the one positive presence of david arquette to add some light .  unfortunately , the bottom line is that the movie will be a success , because teenagers will pay to see any trash .

0|">from writer and director darren stein comes jawbreaker , the poorly told tale of what can happen when an innocent birthday prank goes wrong .  at reagan high , four girls are sitting on top of the world .  courtney shane , played by rose mcgowan , holds the title of meanest , most disrespectful soul in the school .  everyone hates her , but everyone envies her due to her popularity .  courtney is the "" leader "" of her clique , which also includes julie , played by rebecca gayheart , liz purr , played by charlotte roldan , and marcie , played by julie benz are the other three in the group .  it is liz's seventeenth birthday , and julie , courtney , and marcie concur that they will play a seemingly innocent prank on her , but the prank results in the death of liz .  just like stupid teens in any teen directed film such as this one , the foursome decide to cover up the death to make it look like a murder committed by someone else .  and also just like in other teen directed movies , one of the four don't agree with hiding it , this time that character being julie .  and finally , just like in other teen movies , there is a witness outside the group trying to hide the truth .  this time that character being fern mayo ( judy greer ) , who is subject to many cracks from courtney's group , as well as the entire school .  >from here , jawbreaker turns into a predictable tale of revenge , bad morals , and at least trying to do the right thing .  not only is the script weak , on a whole the acting is horrid thanks to a large amount of the main cast .  judy greer is undeniably awful as her one dimensional , annoying character , as she overacts every line she has .  also on the bad side of acting is julie benz , almost falling to the annoying factor that greer delivers .  on the positive side of acting , rose mcgowan performs well here , but doesn't match her wickedly clever performance as "" tatum "" , in 1996's scream .  mcgowan's role is annoying , but this only adds to the film .  she is wickedly mean , and even though she a well-written character , you downright hate her .  faring even better than mcgowan is rebecca gayheart , who is always exceptionally believable as her roles .  when the script feeds her a one or two dimensional character , she turns it into three , always putting strong emotion and power into her roles .  gayheart isn't given as much to do here as she was in 1998's urban legend , but you can still get a strong taste of her acting skills in jawbreaker .  jawbreaker drifts and mianders different sub plots throughout , hardly throwing anything for the viewer to get absorbed in .  we get way off of the topic of the jawbreaker incident , and get into things that don't have anything to do with the actual film .  the beginning and ending are strong , it's just the middle that needs a lot of help .  during the body of the movie , it is undeniably repetitive , never progressing towards a conclusion .  nothing to grab the viewer's interest is around , and the same , extremely annoying song plays over and over again .  jawbreaker tries to get off on the same time of humor used in the 1995 film clueless , but falls flat .  the few gags that actually work die off quickly and die off with a bang .  all in all , a horrible disappointment .  the bottom line : the tagline reads , "" even the sweetest candies are sour as death inside .

0|well there goes another one .  sadly this like other movies this year wasn't good .  this one being almost as bad as 'the omega code' but not quite .  from the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right .  with bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance .  the two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best .  the movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date .  here is the stupid plot : chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years .  jimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up .  he really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch ) .  so he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad .  he of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any .  then his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars . . . . as  long as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm .  now jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths .  ok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs .  even the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good .  the plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old .  the choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any .  even though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him .  rene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming , sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout .  her sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen .  brooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old .  one really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before .  it's not like this is an original idea and in the end , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness .  'the bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all .  ed anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career .  chris o'donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal .  he seems held back and really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old .  artie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving .  why the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie , with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know .  maybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success , and sometimes i don't agree with other critics on movies , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts .  its based on the 1925 silent film 'seven chances' which i am sure is very better than this mess .  even though some may think of this as a good date movie , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back .  besides being a terrible movie , 'the bachelor' is well a terrible movie .  it has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can't recommend this movie .  i did not have a good time and i laughed only three times .  the running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes .  parts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time .  being one of the worst movies of the year , we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies , and if they do they i give up on filmmakers .  |-0.9166666666666666|0.8833333333333333|0.9|The overall sentiment of the explanations is highly negative, with consistent criticism towards the movie, including negative comments about the acting, screenplay, direction, and plot.

0|"my inner flag was at half-mast last year when nick at nite pulled "" dragnet "" reruns off the air .  sure , i'd seen them all at least once , but i could always count on at least a few inadvertent laughs from ultra-serious jack webb when there was nothing else on tv .  even though "" dragnet "" is out of circulation at the moment , we webb anti-fans still have the d . i . , a 50's propaganda piece for the military that is almost as hilarious as the famous "" blue boy "" episode of "" dragnet . ""  for anyone like me who got laughs out of webb's rapid-fire speeches and straight-faced seriousness , think of the d . i .  as what would happen if sgt .  joe friday ever enlisted , because he plays exactly the same character here , a no-nonsense old fart who looks with disdain at the younger generation and loves to give long- winded , melodramatic speeches on any topic .  in this election year , i'm more convinced than ever that webb and bob dole were separated at birth .  the movie opens in characteristic fashion as one recruit after another knocks on webb's office door and enters .  he gives each one a different series of cranky criticisms before the credits come up .  the "" produced and directed by jack webb "" card pretty much goes without saying .  this is his movie all the way , and after the first twenty minutes of him chewing out his recruits for no reason , i was wondering if there would even be a plot .  i certainly would have been entertained by an hour and a half of trademark webb rants , but the d . i .  gives us more -- much more .  webb's mission is to make a man out of private owens , the local screw-up .  the captain gives webb three days to convert owens into marine material or , the captain will "" personally cut the lace off his panties and ship him out myself . ""   ( whether the "" lace panties "" part refers to webb or owens remains unanswered . )  this , of course , gives webb an excuse to focus all his crotchety energy on making owens' life a living hell .  for those of you who haven't been indoctrinated into the pleasures of webb watching , here's a reprint of a typical monologue of his .  i can't duplicate his hilarious delivery on paper , but the words should at least partially convey what i'm talking about . . .   "" now you listen to me , youngster .  someday you'll wake up fighting on a beach and you'll pray to god somebody doesn't get killed because of your foolishness . . .  i've got a headline for you : every time you make one of those little mistakes of yours , you're gonna turn around and i'll be standing right there . ""  i couldn't write down all the reprintable dialogue from the d . i .   ( nearly all of it belongs in the bad movie hall of fame ) , but i tried to include some of the more noteworthy lines , like one from the scene where webb unwinds from a hard day's work by going to the local bar ( where he orders a tomato juice ) .  he meets a woman who , coincidentally , also orders tomato juice but walks away from a typically-stimulating conversation with webb to flirt with his arch-rival , another marine d . i .  webb marches over to the table , gets up in her face and says , "" just what kind of a dame do you think you are ? ""  bogart he ain't .  the other d . i .  gets one of the few memorable non-webb lines when he confesses to the girl , "" he's a damn good d . i .   . . .  i guess i'm just a little jealous . ""  join the club , we're all jealous of jack webb's way with women , which is showcased even more amusingly in a later scene , as webb finds his way to the woman's place of employment , a lingerie store , and stands around looking incredibly flustered at the negligees on display .   "" you expect me to talk to you . . .  in _here_ ? ! "" he exclaims , no doubt intimidated by the barrage of bras .  the woman goes off to help a customer , leaving webb to fend for himself once again in this palace of estrogen .  a little girl spots him in the store and demands , "" what are you doing in here . . . you're a man , aren't you ? ""  he doesn't reply , but you know he's thinking in his head , "" what an odd species of human -- so small .  must be one of those children everyone's been talking about . ""  this poor girl , scarred for life by her early encounter with jack webb , would later swear off the male gender entirely , just one of the many lesbian conversions he's responsible for .  the movie doesn't focus too closely on webb's romance , it also continues the owens subplot with probably the most memorable scene in the entire movie , where webb forces his platoon to spend the entire night searching the ground for a flea owens killed during one of their drills .  after two privates hatch a scheme to present webb with the wrong dead flea , webb asks owens , "" was that flea you killed a male or female ? ""  owens replies , "" a male , sir . ""  webb yells to the platoon , "" this ain't the one ! ""  that such a scene ( along with the rest of the movie ) was intended to be taken seriously defies comment .  but we know it was all presented with the utmost seriousness when a title card at the end thanks the marines not only for their cooperation in the making of the d . i . , but for iwo jima , guadalcanal and every other major battle of the first half of the 20th century .  webb held the military in such high esteem that all the soldiers in the movie ( with the exception of owens ) were played by actual marines .  someone wanting to parody this movie couldn't do a more comical job than webb did .  it makes it all the more ironic ( like raeeyain on your wedding day ) that the man had no sense of humor himself .  there's a scene in the movie where the guys are on their break time discussing something and one of them breaks into laughter .  webb bursts in the room and shouts , "" what did i tell you about laughing ? !

""  then there's d . b .  sweeney as an evil rival coach and john hawkes as reeves' scummy betting buddy and other unoriginal characters you've seen before and hope never to see again .  i wanted hardball to be good .  robbins' varsity blues was a funny and alternately taut tale of texas high school football that had ali larter smothered in whipped cream and jon voight sneering at everything that moved .  i haven't seen robbins' goofy ready to rumble in its entirety , but i am intrigued that "" macho man "" randy savage and martin landau can exist in the same movie without there being serious worldwide repercussions .  robbins obviously needs to go back to his forte -- making sports movies for guys and not cutesy , cuddly pap such as hardball , which also manages to annoy and insult the audience .  here's hoping that happens in the immediate future .

0|"you know something , christmas is not about presents .  it's about over-hyped holiday films with lots of merchandising and product tie-ins .  at least that would seem to be the message of "" the grinch , "" which has been advertised since last christmas and whose logo is currently plastered all over stores .  hollywood expects us to ignore this cynical greed as the movie scolds us about losing the true spirit of the season .  you know the plot : there's this evil furry green guy called the grinch ( jim carrey ) who lives on a mountain overlooking whoville .  down below all the whos are preparing for their whobilation , but the grinch is determined to steal their christmas .  the movie is , of course , a live-action version of the beloved children's book , which was previously adapted into a 1966 tv special by looney tunes animator chuck jones .  it's rare that a big budget hollywood release is shamed by a thirty-year-old half-hour cartoon , but that's the case when jones' version is compared to ron howard's .  the tv grinch hit all the right notes : boris karloff's soft , deep narration ; thurl ravenscroft singing "" mr . grinch "" ; max the dog weighed down by the gigantic antler tied to his head ; and the grinch's wide , toothless grin .  by contrast , the movie hits one sour note after another .  first , there are the numerous bad choices that jeffrey price and peter seaman made in padding out the short book into a 105-minute movie .  young wide-eyed cindy lou who ( taylor momsen ) is depressed about the misplaced priorities of her parents ( bill irwin and molly shannon ) during the holiday season .  she begins to sympathize with the grinch , who turns out to be surprisingly sympathetic .  cindy lou discovers that the grinch turned tearfully away from whoville in grammar school when he was publicly humiliated while expressing his love for the prettiest girl in the class , martha may whovier ( played as an adult by christine baranski ) .  are we expected to like the grinch , hate the whos , and want him to steal christmas ?  the grinch isn't even the villain here ; that role is filled by the corrupt mayor of whoville ( jeffrey tambor ) who was the grinch's rival for martha's affection .  not only are the characters needlessly complex , but the once-simple plot becomes so convoluted that the actual theft of christmas seems like an afterthought .  the casting choices aren't any better than the screenwriting decisions .  jim carrey seems woefully miscast .  while his face is so supple that the rubber make-up seems superfluous , carrey brings nothing else to the role .  his accent keeps changing ; i assume he was shooting for karloff , but he ends up sounding like a weird slurry of richard nixon , sean connery , and cartman from "" south park . ""  not knowing what else to do during his many scenes alone in the grinch's home , carrey falls back on his stand-up comedy and clowns around ace ventura-style .  needless to say , his wise-cracking antics don't quite fit the character of the grinch , who is an embittered loner filled with hate .  little taylor momsen brings little to role of cindy lou except big eyes and a cute smile .  she would have been fine if cindy lou was limited to her original purpose in the seuss story ( finding "" santa "" in her living room stealing the tree ) .  however , the expanded script makes cindy as important as the grinch , and momsen is not up to the challenge .  bottom line : when you're stealing christmas ( movies ) , leave this one behind .

0|in the mid-1980s , following the splendid debut in hugh hudson's greystoke and relative success of first highlander film , it looked like christopher lambert's acting career might go somewhere .  but , it wasn't meant to be , which became obvious following highlander ii .  in this decade christopher lambert became associated with films with low budgets and even lower quality .  very often such films were science fiction , which meant that the fans of that genre learned the hard way what to evade anything starring christopher lambert .  whether it was because of real lack of talent , terrible miscasting or simple bad luck isn't important - the end result was almost always horrible .  the same can be said for fortress , 1993 science fiction film directed by stuart gordon , director who created cult following with his 1980s horror gorefests like reanimator and from beyond .  the movie is set in 2018 .  for some undisclosed reason , usa introduced strict population control and couples are barred from having more than one child .  jake ( christopher lambert ) and karen brennick ( lori laughlin ) broke that law and are caught by authorities on the border .  sentenced to 31 years in prison , they are both thrown into fortress , privately owned correctional facility , equiped with state-of-the-art futuristic technology and run by computer called zed .  although equiped with gismos that regulate every aspect of inmates' lives and make any escape impossible , prison authorities often use violence .  jake survives many ordeals and earns respect of some inmates which would help him when he begins planing the escape .  such escape should become necessity , because the warden poe ( kurtwood smith ) begins showing unhealthy interest in karen .  after rather intriguing beginning and some interesting special effects that depict the futuristic settings of prison , this film soon starts sinking into mediocrity .  the reason is in the screenplay that quickly degenerates into whole series of prison movie clich ? s and situations that are painfully predictable .  by the time brennick begins his escape from fortress , those situations not only begin to look predictable , but utterly implausible too .  of course , film never tried to explain why the country that lacks resources to support its present population happens to spend bucketloads of money on ultra-expensive supertechnology with sole intention of keeping alive most useless and dangerous members of the society .  the initially interesting plot is done even more wrong by stereotyped characters , played by not too interested or talented actors .  lori laughlin , although physically attractive , shows the acting ability of sequoia .  kurtwood smith as prison warden is rather uninspired , capable of solid , yet forgettable performance .  lambert's performance is also good , but even the bigger talent couldn't help this film , destined to end in oblivion .  |-0.4166666666666667|0.8666666666666667|0.8666666666666666|The explanation summarizes that the prompt conveys a negative sentiment towards Christopher Lambert's acting career and criticizes the film Fortress for its predictable plot, stereotyped characters, and uninspired acting.

0|"susan granger's review of "" the musketeer "" ( universal pictures )  hollywood launches another assault on classic literature with this $50 million adaptation of alexandre dumas's novel that's strong on action but weak on drama , fusing hong kong martial arts with 17th century swordplay .  the story chronicles the adventures of the dashing d'artagnan ( justin chambers ) as he leaves his village of gascogne , headed for paris , to join king louis xiii's elite guard , the royal musketeers , and to search for the man who killed his parents 14 years earlier .  this puts him in conflict with the formidable febre ( tim roth ) , vicious henchman for conniving cardinal richelieu ( stephen rea ) .  the traditional musketeer trio - aramis ( nick moran ) , athos ( jan gregor kremp ) and porthos ( steve speirs ) - don't offer much help so he turns to the feisty francesca ( mena suvari ) , chambermaid to the queen of france ( catherine deneuve ) .  scripter gene quintano and director-cinematographer peter hyams are primarily interested in the derring-do , as evidenced by choreographer xin-xin xiong's elaborate - but not original - stunts , including a fast-paced stagecoach chase , a tavern brawl on rolling barrels , high-wire acrobatics with the combatants dangling from ropes , and a ladder-fight sequence .  filmed in southern france , the scenery , sets and costumes are spectacular , but the lighting is too dark and editing is filled with choppy , restless mtv'ish cuts .  as the swashbuckling d'artagnan , bland calvin klein model justin chambers buckles where he should be swashing , totally lacking on-screen charisma , not to mention acting skill .  mena suvari , so impressive in "" american beauty , "" seems like a contemporary interloper in the royal court .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" the musketeer "" is a cinematic but shallow 3 .

0|note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  at the end of the day , those reflecting upon the debacle that is the avengers would do well to take note that warning clouds loomed on the horizon for the project well before warner bros . made the contentious decision to abandon preview press screenings and scrapped plans for a gala premiere .  this highly-anticipated film rendition of the cult television show was originally slotted for an early june opening , where it would have gone head-to-head against the rival studios' heavy hitters ; its eventual demotion to a less potent mid-august opening was an obvious early indication of the studio's lack of confidence with the picture .  and with good reason .  this is a joyless exercise of a film , held together by a barely coherent plot and lacking any semblance of excitement , thrills or wit .  remarkable in its banality and brutally uninvolving , the avengers is a catastrophic mess which immediately invites comparisons to last year's case study in style over substance , joel schumacher's much-loathed batman & robin .   ( indeed , both films even feature appalling , ridiculous sequences which find central characters dressed up in fuzzy oversized costumes . )  uma thurman , who takes on the salacious role of the catsuit-clad , karate-chopping emma peel immortalized by diana rigg , was the only bright spot in the aforementioned schumacher disaster , imbuing her poison ivy with a dose of sassiness and sly wit that gave audiences something to smile at amidst the cinematic carnage .  unfortunately , the same can't be said here , where she and cohort ralph fiennes ( our new john steed , taking over for patrick macnee ) demonstrate no appreciable chemistry whatsoever , fatally crippling the picture as they volley fizzling repartee back and forth and trade double-entendres with all the enthusiasm of two actors painfully aware that they're on board a sinking ship .  at this rate , usually-splendid actor mr . fiennes may never make the transition from arthouse apollo to mainstream leading man -- his tepid turn here will make as much of an inroad as his commendably seedy performance in the regrettably-neglected kathyrn bigelow film strange days .  the duo * look * the part -- and admittedly the avengers is , more than most , heavily dependent upon style -- but they're no fun to watch , and i found myself growing increasingly distant and annoyed by the lack of spark between the two cheekily ironic characters as they navigated through the picture's caper-esque plot .  when not checking my wristwatch or shifting restlessly in my seat , i began to alleviate the boredom by considering how this all might have played out had the filmmakers chose to go instead with that erstwhile emma as our mrs . peel -- no , not kate beckinsale ( although the notion now intrigues me ) , but gwyneth paltrow , who was originally in the running for the part and can veritably handle a spot-on english accent .  if nothing else , it'd at least be highly entertaining for the incongruous sight of the vaguely twiggish young actress kicking butt .  the story , such as it is , involves the ever-bemused tandem of steed and peel combating the malevolent sir august de wynter ( sean connery ) , an eccentric aristocrat threatening the safety of the nation with his climate-controlling contraption .   ( they also sip a lot of tea . )  overlooking some goofy cloning nonsense and quirky hijinx involving our protagonists' superiors , it sounds far better than it plays , and is rendered almost indecipherable by blatant post-production tinkering ; it's clearly evident that the picture has been cut to shreds .  the avengers was never about gripping drama , and our heroes accordingly never take villainous sir august very seriously , but given the lack of cohesion in the plot and the lack of menace conveyed by the buffoonish maniac , it's all decidedly uncompelling .  mr . connery , who's onscreen barely long enough to register an impression , approaches the role like a man fulfilling a contractual obligation , simultaneously chewing the scenery while unable to hide his disinterest .  at least it all looks good .  this is a genuinely handsome production , with fine costume design by anthony powell and crisply shot by roger pratt .  in particular , the gleaming production design by stuart craig commands attention , adeptly drawing elements both old and new in order to depict this great britain .  there are a handful of striking visual moments in the film , including an attack by a swarm of giant robotic bees and a nice shot of steed and peel finding a way to walk on water , but the film is so unremittingly dull that even these instances fail to stir interest or raise pulse rates .  by the time the film's climax had arrived , my interest was not with the sight of steed and sir august slugging it out amidst crashing waves and thundering rain , but with the quickest escape route from the theatre .  not coincidentally , the enticing bits of visual bravura were the shots assembled into the movie's remarkable trailer , a savvy piece of work which ironically is infinitely more appealing that the feature film itself ; the first promo which made the rounds in early spring is probably my favourite studio trailer so far this year .  it's everything that the avengers is not -- saucy , clever , engaging , and entertaining .  a crushing disappointment , the film is one of the worst outings of the year -- too drearily awful to be savoured as gleefully bad , too polished to overlook its deficiencies .  there may be upcoming pictures that are even more lifeless than the avengers , but i sure hope not .  |-0.8000000000000002|0.8666666666666667|0.7833333333333333|"The film ""The Avengers"" is described as a joyless exercise with a barely coherent plot, lacking excitement, thrills, and wit.

0|"the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing .  however , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel .  and , considering the quality of species 2 , it's obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead .  the only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is .  if you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience .  of course , that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys ( who , at least in theory , shouldn't be able to get into an "" r "" -rated film ) and connoisseurs of bad movies .  there's enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring .  this is a grade z exploitation flick that's ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment .  somewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as "" erotic . ""  i would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism .  sure , there's a lot of sex and nudity , but it's almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman's abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions .  anyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater .  i suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly ) .  although the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone .  this creature , dubbed "" eve "" by its creator , dr . laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile .  meanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars .  a team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them .  ross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he's soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session .  his intention is obviously world domination .  standing in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick's fellow astronauts , dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) .  but when patrick learns about eve , a female of his kind , there's no damping his ardor .  i'm not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) .  michael madsen and marg helgenberger , both back for a second round , are clearly on hand to do as little as they can , grab the money , and run .  ditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick's father -- "" underused "" is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( "" invisible "" would be more like it ) .  george dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general .  meanwhile , justin lazard's performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge's limited abilities look good by comparison .  the only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick .  complete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics .  director peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness .  do i recommend the movie ?  absolutely not , but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn't try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do .  here's hoping there's no species 3 .
