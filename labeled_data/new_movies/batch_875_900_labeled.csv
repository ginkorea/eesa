1|"every once in a while , when an exceptional family film comes along , i will attempt to champion it by challenging parents to put their money where their mouths have been ; with all the hubbub over the lack of films suitable for children , it is remarkable how many non-disney films disappear in a couple of weeks .  now i see that in so doing , i have unfairly ghettoized these films .  so i am issuing my challenge not just to parents , but to anyone who wants to support smart , funny , energetic film-making : see matilda .  see it in a theater , rather than shrugging and waiting for it on video .  see the best film i have seen in 1996 .  not the best children's film . . . the  best film .  period .  based on a story by roald dahl , it tells of young matilda wormwood ( mara wilson ) , an extraordinarily bright girl whose great misfortune it is to have a pair of deeply stupid parents : harry ( danny devito ) , a crooked used car salesman ; and zinnia ( rhea perlman ) , a simple-minded bingo addict .  the wormwoods barely notice matilda exists , and when they do , it is only to scold her for spending too much time reading books .  when they finally do send her to school , it is to crunchem hall , a bleak place run by cruel , child-hating miss agatha trunchbull ( pam ferris ) .  but things begin to look up for matilda when she discovers a sympathetic teacher , miss honey ( embeth davidtz ) , who nurtures her natural inquisitiveness .  matilda also discovers another special talent -- the ability to move things with her mind -- which allows her to help herself and miss honey to overcome miss trunchbull's cruelty .  it was this spring's james and the giant peach which inspired me to note that the best and most lasting tales for children tended to have more than a hint of darkness to them , and you can bet that the roald dahl responsible for the gleeful ghoulishness of james and willy wonka and the chocolate factory has more of the same in store with matilda .  and just as james benefited from the dark sensibilities of henry selick and tim burton , matilda soars on the cock-eyed direction of danny devito .  devito made black humor a key element in throw momma from the train and the war of the roses , and he contributes some memorable images .  in one scene , an unfortunate girl is made an example of by miss trunchbull when she is picked up by her pig-tails and flung through the air like a throwing hammer ; later , an overweight boy is forced to eat an entire massive cake after he is caught stealing a dessert .  matilda is just twisted enough to be a perfect fairy tale .  it is also characteristic of the best children's tales that they manage to teach lessons in such a way that children almost don't realize that they are learning them .  there is a hilarious moment when matilda's television-addicted father snatches away the book she is reading ( in a wicked joke , he thinks _moby dick_ is pornographic ) and forces her to watch an inane game show ( hosted by jon lovitz ) in which contestants are smeared with adhesive and placed in a booth filled with cash blowing around .  matilda is a story which promotes the value of intellectual curiosity over passive entertainment , and it does so while poking holes in that most frustrating of notions for a child -- that because "" i'm big and you're little , i'm right and you're wrong . ""  more specifically , it has as its heroine an intelligent , self-confident girl who struggles successfully against other people's notions of how she should behave .  it is no coincidence that matilda was co-written by robin swicord , who contributed the superb recent adaptation of little women .  finally , matilda has that quality i find rarest and most treasured in family entertainment : it is family entertainment in the truest sense of the word .  devito knows enough to make matilda fast-paced and appealing to children , taking a deliciously nasty performance by pam ferris as miss trunchbull and making it the focal point of some priceless physical comedy , including a great chase through her dark house .  the child actors are winning but never obnoxiously adorable , with mara wilson making matilda a clever and extremely likeable character .  but there are also many , many delights for adults , including my favorite scene in which matilda uses her powers to frighten miss trunchbull by having chalk write on a chalkboard by itself while matilda's classmates recite in sing-song fashion ; there is also a deadpan cameo by paul reubens as an fbi agent staking out matilda's father .  i can't imagine anyone of any age leaving matilda feeling as though his or her intelligence had been insulted .  matilda is a film which left me glowing with good feeling .  i will see it again , and years from now i will watch it with my children .  and now i will stop , because somewhere near you matilda is about to begin , and there is a seat in that theater you should be in , if you have a child or ever were a child .

1|usually when one is debating who the modern queen of the romantic comedy is they will bring up names like julia roberts or sandra bullock .  others will mention meg ryan .  but for me , it's not even close .  janeane garofalo is not only the queen of the romantic comedy , she is the best comic actress in hollywood right now .  and it's a good thing she's starring in the matchmaker , because without her presence the movie would be bland , unfunny , and dull .  garofalo stars as marcy tizard , a top aide to boston senator john mcglory , who is suffering in the polls .  in an attempt to capture the irish vote , he sends marcy on a mission to a small irish town called ballinagra in search of other mcglory's that never moved to america .  unfortunately for marcy , her visit coincides with the town's annual matchmaking festival .  things get off to a rocky start for marcy though .  she has no hotel reservations ( for no rational reason ) and the tiny confined room ( tired old cliche' ) she has to stay in has a visitor in her bathtub .  his name is sean , and marcy finds him repugnant at first , so you can obviously tell where this is headed .  the movie runs into a few roadblocks .  for instance , the story is very thin .  none of the characters ( except the old local matchmaker ) are nearly as interesting as garofalo .  some of the characters , like the political aide played by denis leary , have wandered in from a completely different movie .  i think the director realized this and decided to throw in numerous shots of the beautiful irish scenery , and several close-ups of garofalo's winning smile .  the strange thing is that it works .  garofalo's charm and the irish scenery could carry the thinnest of stories , and it carries this one .  |0.4666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|0.8666666666666667|"The overall sentiment towards Janeane Garofalo and her performance in ""The Matchmaker"" is positive, with praise for her as the queen of romantic comedy and the best comic actress in Hollywood.

1|"susan granger's review of "" bread and tulips "" ( first look pictures )  in this delightfully frothy italian romantic comedy , after accidentally being left behind by a tour bus while on a family vacation with her cranky husband and two cynical teenagers , rosalba ( licia maglietta ) , an unhappy housewife from pescara , finds herself - and love - in venice .  for the first time in years , rosalba's on her own when she's abandoned at a highway rest area .  although her philandering husband ( antonio catania ) , a plumbing-supply dealer , orders her to stay there until she's picked up , she impulsively accepts a ride to venice , a bohemian paradise which she's never visited .  rosalba finds refuge and romance with fernando ( bruno ganz ) , a gruff icelandic waiter who offers her a spare room in his modest apartment and prepares breakfast for her each morning .  to support herself , she gets a job working with a florist ( antonio catania ) .  film-maker silvio soldini gently explores the blossoming of this bored , middle-aged , middle-class woman with warmth and affection , savoring special moments such as when rosalba starts playing the accordion again and abandons her maroon stretch pants , silver jacket and orange sneakers for a simple , new red-and-white dress with platform-soled espadrilles .  the superb actors slip into their roles seamlessly , particularly luminous licia maglietta and low-key bruno ganz , along with marina massironi as her nosy massage-therapist neighbor and giuseppe massironi as the inept plumber-turned-private eye who's sent to retrieve her on orders from her frantic husband - who's discovered that his mistress has no interest in doing his laundry or cleaning the house .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , "" bread and tulips "" is a beguiling , escapist 8 .  as the summer ends , it's a magical getaway for mature audiences . .  "|0.75|0.9|0.8666666666666667|"The review of ""Bread and Tulips"" is overwhelmingly positive, praising the delightful and romantic aspects of the Italian comedy, the performances of the actors, and the exploration of the main character's personal growth.

1|" "" i know what you did last summer , "" the first high-profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996's "" scream , "" and written by the same screenwriter , kevin williamson , is a stylish , effective horror film that became 1997's biggest hit of the fall season .  while "" scream "" was a more knowing film about the genre , "" i know what you did last summer "" is more reminiscent of a straight-forward slasher flick , but it is far more intelligent than such bottom-of-the-barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the "" friday the 13th "" films ( well , okay , "" jason goes to hell "" was pure hell to sit through ) .  the film starts off with four talented , aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport , n . c .  it is the 4th of july , and they will soon be heading their separate ways .  kind-hearted julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , and outsider ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) will be headed off to college , while helen ( sarah michelle gellar ) , who has just been honored croaker queen in the town , and her ignorant jock boyfriend , barry ( ryan phillippe ) , are going to new york to become an actress and football player .  when the four of them travel to a nearby mountain-side beach for the evening , they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home .  distraught and confused , they decide they can't go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter , so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean , in hopes no one will find him .  julie is apprehensive about it , but is forced into it by barry .  switch to exactly a year later , julie , still unable to come to terms with what she did , reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out .  almost immediately , julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads , "" i know what you did last summer , "" and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook .   "" i know what you did last summer , "" is a successful horror film for a number of reasons .  the cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian , as it put shadows , fog , steam , and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings .  the characters , particularly julie and helen , are realistically written , and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes , which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort .  and last , the film creates a few dazzling and scary set-pieces that are some of the most memorable i've seen in a horror movie , particularly the suspenseful , superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family's store with the killer inside with her .  perhaps the best character is that of missy egan ( anne heche ) , a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit .  heche's performance is a standout , as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time .   "" i know what you did last summer , "" could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems .  prinze jr . gives a performance to be desired here , and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth .  also , the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer , who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines .  luckily , the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale , which includes an expertly crafted "" jump-in-your-seat "" scare .  in the main roles , hewitt and gellar are highly talented , and hewitt , especially , is one of the best screamers i've ever heard .  she honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best "" scream queen . ""  and gellar is touching as a young woman who , in the course of one year , finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered .  although not up to the level of either "" scream "" movies , or the more recent , "" urban legend , "" "" i know what you did last summer "" is a respectable , smartly-scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made .

1|"labelling is sometimes everything .  in original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own .  walter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors .  producers weren't thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones .  on the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america .  to make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago .  instead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city .  the gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx .  that is far away from warriors' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce .  on the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city .  crowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus .  police simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs .  the remaining eight , led by cleon's lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs .  upon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status .  however , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year .  the reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly .  if walter hill's idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably .  the future was much worse than his vision .  the youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities .  their members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime .  in their vocabulary , word "" arms "" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns .  they even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own .  many people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors .  some of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour .  despite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film .  the plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes .  the fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn't much bloodshed or gore in the movie .  editing is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory .  the soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable .  yet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity .  best known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains .  michael beck as cool , almost statesman-like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot-shot contender for top spot .  all in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies .

1|"for those who associate italian cinema with fellini and "" high art , "" the son's room is an inventive , subtle alternative .  written by , directed , and starring nanni moretti , it takes us through the slow , complicated path of bereavement .  slow is the best description for the film at first .  it takes its time in establishing the habits of what appears to be a normal , happy family .  father and mother both work but still find the time to support their son and daughter through homework and after school activities .  they laugh , spend free time together , and reprimand the kids for innocent wrongs with a sigh and soft pat on the shoulder .  you get the feeling there is open communication and unconditional love amongst the foursome .  but suddenly , the son is found to be dead after a diving accident .  the family dynamics begin an unpredictable descent that gives the narrative strength when you least expect it , but can also be trying on the attention span .  though the film drags and even repeats itself , this can be somewhat excused as influenced by the process of grieving .  though nanni moretti wore several hats for this production , it doesn't come across as a vanity piece .  one might wish he hadn't picked the profession of analyst for the father , giovanni ( which he stars as ) , if only because this makes his character's reactions so predictable .  what saves it is a well written script , with spare dialogue and an eclectic variety of human interaction .  the potency of the film lies in the recreation of the tiny details of everyday life that alter due to the death of a close relative , or that remind a depressed person of loss .  you start to take notice of the cracked dishes , ignored when familial bliss was in full swing .  you remember bonding during the routine jogs around the block , and not necessarily huge events like graduation .  even better are the role reversals that take place within the household .  while giovanni and paola ( laura morante ) do check up on their daughter irene ( jasmine trinca ) , there is a sense of being on autopilot .  not only does irene begin to take care of her own needs more , she'll make her parents breakfast in an attempt to crack their new shells to life around them .  these scenes provide interesting portrayals of various coping mechanisms , frequently crossing a boundary as to how much you can help yourself versus others during drastic , unexpected change .  respectfully , gender issues never enter the picture .  self-propelled isolation is universal in terms of dealing , so moretti intelligently uses this tool to separate the family .  though giovanni does stop paolo from discussing andrea at a party with friends , there is never a sense that he or she is more stoic , or more correct in the search to restore a sense of a balance to their lives .  most films that broach the topic of death utilize annoying melodrama , speeches , and conciliatory issues to get the waterworks flowing .  in contrast , the son's room captures a more realistic depiction of the effects of death on a family by graciously flowing among the five stages of mourning ( denial , depression , anger , bargaining , acceptance ) through each of its main characters .  it's not the most engaging 100 minutes , but it is certainly easy to relate to .  "|0.65|0.8333333333333334|0.9166666666666666|"""The Son's Room"" is a praised and relatable film that offers an inventive and subtle alternative to high art Italian cinema, with a realistic depiction of the effects of death, although it can be slow and repetitive at times."
1|the word 'rest' in the title should be stressed since this is a movie that lacks any action scenes at all .  what does takes place is more based on character development .  the film starts right in the middle of the lives of four people : nick , beth , carol and sid .  what they have done earlier is for the most part only hinted at .  nick and beth have a relationship and have decided to move from enfield , arizona to butte , montana .   ( and i who thought that butte was pronounced slightly different . . . )  carol is nick's ex-girlfriend and beth's best friend , sid is a joint-smoking painter that comes to repaint their house before the new tenants move in .  obviously based on a stage play , the problem with the movie is that there's a lot of things left out .  it's not obvious that nick and beth are in love with each other , the reason why nick was fired from his job isn't mentioned .  and why nick suddenly decide to go visit his parents remain a mystery , when he hasn't seen them for many years .  set in a small ( fictional ? )  town in arizona was a good move , since this makes the film focus on the four characters and not on their surroundings .  the name of the city is not important , this could take place anywhere with four young people in a house discussing life and the future .  particularly impressive is bridget fonda as beth who end up in bed with sid when her fiance nick leaves her .  not an actress that i have found interesting earlier or seen many pictures with , but i'll keep an eye on her in the future .  interesting trivia : this was rated r in the us but rated 'barntill ? ten' in sweden wich means that anyone at any age can see it .  |-0.4000000000000001|0.8000000000000002|0.8833333333333333|The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly negative, with mention of the movie lacking action scenes, important details being left out, and weaknesses in storytelling.

1|"airplane ! is considered among many to be the epitome of satire film-making .  after all , it's brought to us by one of the best known satire writing/directing teams .  even if most people don't recognize the names behind the films , they are bound to recognize the titles : airplane ! , top secret , the naked gun , and hot shots to name a few .  but although the zucker/abrahams/zucker team was first introduced with the kentucky fried movie in 1977 , airplane !  remains the true cornerstone of their work , and their directorial debuts .  in the seventies , disaster films seemed to be at an all time high .  films like earthquake , the towering inferno , and the poseidon adventure were big hits .  there was also a series about the disasters that can arise when traveling by plane - a series that spanned the entire decade .  and so , in 1980 , we were introduced to a new airplane disaster film .  this time the disaster had nothing to do with a maniacal hijacker or crashing into the ocean .   .   .  it had to do with bad fish .  airplane ! is the story of ted striker ( robert hays ) - an ex-fighter-pilot who has never gotten over the fact that a decision he had to make in the midst of war led to the death of six , er , seven comrades .  unable to stop living in the past , ted's world fell apart .  he spent his time moving from city to city without ever having a stable job , and eventually , as we begin this film , is getting dumped by his lover , flight attendant elaine dickinson ( julie hagerty ) .  in a desperate attempt not to lose her , ted buys a ticket for the same flight elaine is working .  unfortunately , she is unsympathetic and even criticizes ted for following her , which leaves him wallowing in self-pity .  in the midst of it all , something happens .  someone gets sick .  then another .  then another .  soon , the whole plane is full of deathly-ill chicago-bound people .   .   .  and when the pilots get sick ( played by peter graves , kareem abdul-jabbar , and frank ashmore ) , who will save the day ?   ( gee , i wonder )  of course the main draw here is the non-stop "" whiz-bang "" comedy , with a hefty dose of both visual and spoken gags .  although i had seen this movie a few times before , i was still laughing thru the entire thing .  the most fun character by far is the doctor , played by leslie nielsen .  he's a dry , subtle , sterotypically straight-faced doctor that ends up saying some of the funniest lines of the film .  in a film like this , you're not really expecting an elaborate production , so one can't complain about the amateurish quality .  what you can complain about is the absolutely annoying johnny , played by stephen stucker .  this character is pointless , nauseating , and very unfunny .  i don't know why he was put in there , and i don't think anybody will find a good excuse .  and when the film nears an end , it slows down quite a bit , almost getting old .  you gotta give it to a movie that only runs 88 minutes and can feel two hours long .  aside from that , airplane !  is really a top-notch spoof that will likely forever be known as a spoof classic .  it would be a good choice to pop in the vcr with a group of friends , especially if they haven't seen it .  and if they ask what the plot is , just tell 'em "" it's a synopsis of the basic storyline of the film , but that's not important right now .

1|this is the movie not the perfume .  a slow moving , stylish psychological thriller in imitation of hitchcock's vertigo .  it is adapted from an original story by brian de palma and paul schrader , and is directed by de palma and scripted by schrader .  set in new orleans , 1959 , it shows the wealthy michael courtland ( cliff robertson ) sitting on top of the world , celebrating his tenth wedding anniversary with a party in his mansion , as his lovely wife elizabeth ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and young daughter amy ( blackman ) , both look up to him beaming with joy .  his real-estate development partner bob la salle ( john lithgow ) proposes a toast to him and to their prosperous business , while his high society friends give him their best wishes .  upon retiring for the night , his daughter and wife are kidnapped in their bedroom and he is left with a ransom note to deliver $500 , 000 tomorrow or they will be killed .  inspector brie ( stanley reyes ) comes up with a plan to put in phony money and a transmitter in the briefcase exchange , as that will lead them to the kidnappers .  but the kidnappers burst out of the house surrounded by the police , taking the two victims with them and in the pursuing police chase , the kidnapper's car explodes and goes over the bridge , where none of the bodies were found .  grieving the loss of his wife and child , the guilt-ridden michael builds them a tomb on the expensive land they were to develop .  sixteen years later he goes with his partner bob on a vacation and he revisits florence , italy , where he met his wife .  when he goes to the church where they met , he sees a young girl who looks exactly like his wife .  her name is sandra portinari ( genevi ? ve bujold ) and she's working there restoring art that is decaying .  he falls instantly in love with her and doesn't heed bob's warnings that she might be a gold digger and decides to take her back to new orleans and marry her .  sandra becomes his second chance to prove his love , as he thinks he can finally put the past behind him .  the surprises to come weren't really all that surprising , as the beauty in the storytelling is almost exclusively in the understated acting by the soul stricken cliff robertson , the emotionally impactful performance by genevi ? ve bujold , and the competent acting of john lithgow .  it plays too much like a rehash of the master's work , to break any new ground , yet it is still thrilling in its own way .  |0.03333333333333333|0.7666666666666666|0.8333333333333334|The movie is praised for its understated acting, emotionally impactful performances, and being a slow-moving, stylish psychological thriller, but some view it as a rehash of Hitchcock's work, resulting in a slightly positive sentiment overall.

1|"when jim henson passed away , he left behind diverse legions of fans and a company whose ultimate success , it now seems , hinged on his input .  jim henson productions and the creature shop are still thriving financially , but as the last two muppet films ( or that silly computer-generated monkey from lost in space ) demonstrate , the thrill and genius are gone .  i'm not sure the dark crystal , made today , would generate from an audience of kids five to fifty the same awe-filled response .  an all-powerful crystal has cracked , causing the leaders of the green world to split apart into two beings : the big , gentle mystics , and the vulture-like skeksis .  the mystics send jen , a naive gelfling boy , on a mission to find the shard that cracked away , which must be reinserted into the crystal before the skeksis become eternal rulers , before the great "" conjunction "" of three suns .  along the way , jen encounters and teams up with the only other gelfling alive , the rebecca demornay-like kira , an ogre-witch named aughra , who removes her eyes to look at things , and a spastic-but-friendly , tumbleweed-like animal named fizzgig .  much of the beauty in the dark crystal , which is a simple tale ( though it does not condescend to any viewer ) , lies in its art direction and creature design .  the puppeteering is phenomenal--observe the scenes in which jen plays his flute , or the landwalker chase--but i must stress that any thoughts of strings and hands and remote controls all but vanish in the opening moments of the picture , a delicately-narrated ( by john baddeley ) , absorbing prologue .  the voice work in the film , by muppet regulars and irregulars , is tone-perfect .  as well , trevor jones' score should not be discounted : it contributes to the film almost as an unseen character .  i suppose , due to the complexity involved in executing a movie of this nature , that it couldn't be helped , but i wish the film was longer .  jen and kira have wonderful . . . well ,  chemistry , and more scenes of them quietly conversing would have been appreciated .  the dark crystal has a very small cult following .  the weaker labyrinth is probably better-known , which is upsetting .  a friend of mine related a story to me that henson was pressured into planting humans among labyrinth's creatures due to the financial failure of people-less the dark crystal .  that film never quite found its footing ; it played like an acid-trip episode of "" the muppet show "" with david bowie as guest-host , borrowing from tolkien and pandering to tolkien's fan-base .

1|"bob the happy bastard's quickie review :  the mummy  brendan fraser's stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . .  fraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) .  it's a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in .  but who cares , the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can't get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon .  fraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground .  basically , it's a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress .  his plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible .  of course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising's kevin j . o'connor ) and some "" americans "" . . . and  guess what ?  yup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc .  fire flies from the sky , flesh-eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep's plan begins to unfold .  ok , so it's not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough .  the special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz isn't half bad either .  the action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well .  no , it's no phantom menace beater , but if you're looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season , you won't find a better film under wraps than the mummy .  if this doesn't give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will .

1|the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman .  you kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips .  as it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes .  instead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city .  the laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity .  the film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment .  he loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds .  arthur's professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas .  his personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives .  in fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) .  it's the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark .  arthur's not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body .  she has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine .  veteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process .  she plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture .  arthur's girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation .  arthur's best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns .  joey is married to arthur's jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house .  arthur's 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math !  he finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations .  the various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity .  like wang's earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences .  every character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way .  the movie also offers a provocative look at technology .  wang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job .  the film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers .  wang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions .  was einstein responsible for the a-bomb ?  is arthur weiss responsible for his lasers ?  the movie pits spirituality against technology , man against machine , and the result is a draw .  according to the film , technology has its place , but we must employ it with great forethought and caution .  ironically , by its very nature , the laserman is a triumph of technology--the technology of filmmaking .  wang's direction is exquisite , especially during the tense finale in which the director frantically cross-cuts between the various subplots , perhaps in homage to d . w .  griffith .  cinematographer ernest dickerson , who has worked on all of spike lee's films , gives the laserman a distinctive , artistic look .  mason daring's score , which includes a send-up of bach , is right on target .  the laserman is an ambitious endeavor , which is to be applauded , but it's sometimes ambitious to a fault .  wang serves up so many slices of life in the film that it's hard to digest them all .  for instance , one character ( arthur's sister ) has negligible screen time , and consequently we just don't care about her marital problems .  in weaving his web , wang has included a few too many strands .  overall , however , the laserman is a charmingly eclectic concoction .  on the surface , the film is a light and bouncy comedy-thriller , overflowing with whimsical humor and visual style .  the heavier issues emerge only when you take a deeper look at the film .  you can ponder the moral questions or you can just sit back and enjoy the absurdity of life in china town .  |0.4203333412806194|0.8500000000000001|0.8166666666666668|The film is described in a positive light, with praise for its unique characters, diverse cultural representation, and exploration of spirituality versus technology.

1|"imagine this .  you're given a sword and a shield and very basic , minimal training .  a man you don't know tells you that this will be the last day that you will live .  you are thrown into an arena with thousands of spectators wanting to see you die .  you frantically monitor several closed doors which , in seconds , will release vicious enemies prepared to destroy you .  you watch as the innocent friends you made in the last few days are murdered in cold blood .  if you are lucky enough to survive this chaos thrown at you , you know you're going to have to do it all over again tomorrow .  eventually know matter how strong or skilled you are , you're going to die .  this is the life of a gladiator .  you'll never have to be a gladiator and after seeing ridley scott's powerful gladiator , you'll be thankful for that .  with his new film , scott has returned cinema to the fascinating age of the ancient roman empire .  and like those preceding it , spartacus and ben hur , gladiator has nearly everything going for it - a strong lead actor , a wonderful supporting cast , eye-catching special effects , and a great script .  since the two aforementioned films came out before the prime target viewers of gladiator ( teenagers to thirty-year-old males ) were around , a whole new genre may just be reborn and revisited .  >from a weak beginning , the film starts off extremely gloomy and inauspicious .  rome's best general maximus ( russell crowe ) , who has helped the empire conquer nearly everywhere they have attempted , is currently ( in the year 180 a . d . that is ) waging a war against germania .  scott shoots the gory battle in an awkward style , similar to that of saving private ryan but much less effective .  it's blurry , in slow motion , and the sound is muted .  as soon as this artistic method began , it was hard to tell what was what and who was who .  it's a good thing scott stops this after the first twenty minutes or else gladiator would have been torture to watch .  instead , the general swears he will get out after this battle .  he wants to go back to his family and his crops , he wants a quiet life .  but , unexpectedly , he gets anything but that .  the dying emperor of rome , marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , decides to have maximus appointed new emperor of rome once he dies .  he asks maximus to restore the republic by giving more power to the senators .  all of this does not go well for aurelius' son , commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) who was expecting his father to name him the new emperor .  jealous and upset , commodus kills his own father , names himself emperor , kills maximus' wife and son , and attempts to kill maximus .  but maximus is able to escape his own death and vows to kill commodus and fulfill marcus aurelius' wishes .  now a slave , the only way he can win his own freedom and complete his goal is to become a winning gladiator , who eventually are released for their success .  a story of betrayal and promises , gladiator is more than just a mindless action flick .  you actually care about the characters , sometimes even the evil villain commodus , who is just a young man as determined to make rome one way as maximus is determined to make it the other way .  phoenix plays his character brilliantly .  think of commodus as the percy wetmore ( of pant-wetter the green mile ) of the roman empire - a whiny , sleazy , "" respect-me-because-my-father-was-a-good-man "" brat who hates when he's not the center of attention .  every scene we see commodus , he's either crying or he looks like he has just been crying .  phoenix has definitely matured as an actor since to die for , and gladiator shows he's more than just river's little brother .  crowe is also excellent as the film's grisly-faced hero .  maximus is one of the few characters in recent cinema who actually has emotions .  this guy actually acts like a anyone in his situation would act , he's no invincible superhero who only blurts out one-liners , he ( believe it or not ) acts like a human being !  the rest of the cast , including richard harris , djimon hounsou , walter hill , derek jacobi , and connie nielsen are also first rate .  ridley scott , using outstanding special effects , has brilliantly recreated the roman coliseum , the loudness of the roman mob , and the city of rome in general .  the visuals are breathtaking and voluminous , like a cleopatra of the year 2000 .  the costuming is also wonderful from the detailed shields and armor to the exquisite dress of the upper-class politicians .  gladiator is another movie you have to see on the big screen to get the most out of the experience .  along with u-571 , action fans should have plenty to see in theaters this week and should expect much more excitement to come this summer of 2000 .

1|so here is the second of 1999's remakes of classic horror movies .  the first was the dumb , pathetic but ok remake of the classic 'the haunting' .  now comes the highly awaited remake of house on haunted hill .  the classic which starred vincent price as a man who pays a group of people 100 , 000 to stay in his house .  if they survive the night they get the money .  if not well you get the jurisdiction .  having not yet seen the film ( dvd on its way ) i wasn't sure if i would really like the remake .  but sure enough it comes through and has a great storyline to fall back on .  geoffrey rush ( in a fantastic role with an incredible performance ) is steven price , the owner of an amusement park destined to scare the wits out of people .  his wife evelyn price is throwing a party with her friends .  steven dismays at the idea and makes his own list .  somehow someone , or something changes that list and five other people are invited to the party .  eddie ( taye diggs ) an ex-baseball player , sarah ( ali carter ) an ex-assistant who can re-wire anything , melissa ( brigette wilson ) a talk-show host in sorts , dr . blackburn ( peter ghallager ) , and watson ( chris kattan ) a smart-mouthed humorist in ways .  what he is gonna do is pay these five people 1 , 000 , 000 dollars if they can survive through the night .  if they can they get the money , if not well they don't .  the house on haunted hill used to be an insane asylum .  years before mental patients broke out and killed the dr . there , forcing him to lock the place up because if he died , so did they .  everyone who was in there burned to death .  now it is steven price's home and he is throwing this party for these five people .  what starts out as a seemingly normal night , turns into a horrifying , blood splattering night .  the deep dark secrets of what really happened in that asylum and why those guests are actually there are revealed .  one-by-one the people start to disappear .  conspiracies start to turn up , and steven price finds out that his house may be alive after all .  the people find rooms , which once held mental patients .  rooms which once had people dying .  rooms which may still contain these people .  now these five people must try and survive the night and try and survive the house , and they must survive each other with terrorfying results .  since i officially haven't seen the original i can't say which is better .  i can say however i liked this movie .  geoffrey rush gives a one in a million performance as the rich steven price , and does a great job doing a vincent price role .  famke jansen as his wife was great and even kind of eerie at times .  ali carter and taye diggs sort of become the main characters and ali carter who debuted in varsity blues gives a fantastic performance here as does taye diggs .  chris kattan gives us great comic relief and the movie contains a lot of comical lines .  peter ghallager and brigette wilson were great as well and gave commanding performances as potential victims .  the plot was well conceived and was very absorbing .  the movie has atmosphere the whole way through that is disturbing and creepy , and even sometimes downright scary .  i found even the opening credits to me a little ominous .  one thing i knew not to expect was a 'haunting' type movie with special effects galore .  even though it had fantastic gore and special effects , the movie has only a 19 million dollar budget , which doesn's show all the way through but you can tell .  the movie was written well , and it's only major flaw is the under-developed characters and plot holes that we are left with .  the ending is quite clever and some may not even get it .  i must say house on haunted hill was a surprise .  i was expecting another haunting with special effects , no scares and a dumb ending .  instead i found a good halloween movie with gore , scares and great acting .  house on haunted hill is one of those movies you really can't take seriously .  though it is a well-made movie with a good storyline it still has some flaws .  but besides that the movie is fun , smart and scary and makes us wonder why remakes like this can't be made all the time !  |-0.16|0.7999999999999999|0.6999999999999998|The overall sentiment of the explanations is slightly negative but the reviewer still enjoys the movie for its gore, scares, great acting, and a great storyline despite flaws in characters and plot holes.
1|apollo 13 is simply one of the most dramatic film this summer ( apart from swashbuckling braveheart ) .  director ( and former actor ) ron howard ( splash , backdraft , far & away ) , most noted for his dramatic film making , displays again his brilliance in creating drama and suspense in apollo 13 .  being the second largest box office hit in the us this summer ( with more than us$150 million in the states alone ) , this film is his most successful effort yet .  perhaps one of the most appealing feature of this film is the pool of talented actors such as tom hanks ( gump himself ) , kevin bacon ( footloose , tremors , a few good men etc . ) , gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , bill paxton ( aliens , true lies , boxing helena ) and ed harris ( the abyss , just cause ) . .  all of whom gave good performances in their respective roles .  apollo 13 was the second worst accident ever to occur in the history of us spaceflight ( the worst being the challenger accident ) .  jim lovell ( hanks ) , the mission commander , together with his crew , fred haise ( paxton ) and last minute replacement tom swigert ( bacon ) are put to the ultimate test when part of their command module explodes on the third day of the mission , more than three quarters way to the moon .  suspense and drama ensue as the three men are left in space with their spaceship out of control and the problem of surviving the journey home . . .  if they ever reach it .  ed harris and gary sinise who play , respectively , the man in charge of the entire mission control and the astronaut who was supposed to fly but was diagnosed with measles , both delve into their roles superbly .  audiences are shown the chaotic and worrisome state of the entire ground control crew , as they frantically attempt to come up with ideas on how to save the astronauts from hurtling into space .  also , there are quite a number of real news footages which were broadcast during the accident which took the entire us nation into 5 days of drama in 1970 .  the special effects by digital domain are up to standard and the music suits the suspense and drama very well , thanks to film-music maestro james horner .  watch out for the launching sequence , it is simply one of the most breathtaking scenes of the film .  a bad point though : apollo 13 features much technical jargon and many physics concepts in its script .  those who consider themselves `scientifically illiterate' might have a slight problem understanding what caused this and what caused that during the course of the show .  this is however , just a minor point , just forget all those technical bullshit and immerse yourselves into the drama and suspense throughout the film .  you should enjoy it .  |0.7799999999999999|0.8666666666666667|0.8333333333333334|"The film ""Apollo 13"" is highly praised for its brilliant storytelling, talented cast, successful box office performance, and impressive special effects, with the only minor negative being the presence of technical jargon.

1|"in _daylight_ , sylvester stallone breaks no new ground , cinematically speaking , but he covers familiar territory quite well .  yesterday , as i was going about my business in the university bookstore , i noticed this stand with these _daylight_ movie posters on it .  i had never heard of the movie , so i stopped by to check it out .  it turned out that they were giving away free passes to the movie for people who had or applied for the credit card they were offering .  so , i shrugged , thought , "" hey , they probably won't give me the card anyway , and i could always use a free movie , "" so i signed up .  all in all , i don't think i got that bad of a deal , either .  rob cohen , who has previously brought us such films as _dragon : the bruce lee story_ and , more recently , _dragonheart_ ( gee , i wonder if he likes dragons for some reason ?  you think ? ) , now brings us a very nicely executed disaster picture , with fx by industrial light and magic , about the after-effects of an explosion that collapses a busy tunnel between new york and new jersey .  sylvester stallone plays kit latura , who is essentially a carbon copy of the character he played in _cliffhanger_ : a paramedic on the outs because he made a mistake that got people killed .  when the crisis hits , he is in the right place at the right time and takes it upon himself to go in and get everybody out .  there are other similarities to _cliffhanger_ , too ; perhaps the only real difference is that _cliffhanger_ had a villain , where _daylight_'s bad guy is mother nature .  in fact , had the two movies been made in hong kong , this might have been titled _cliffhanger ii_--it bears the same relationship to that film that most hk film "" sequels "" do to their predecessors .  the first half-hour of _daylight_ is setup .  subplots are woven , and the mechanism of the disaster is assembled .  we meet all the important people . . . toxic waste disposal truck drivers ; a young , frustrated , jilted , rejected playwright ; a family struggling to stay together ; an older couple and their dog ; a truckload of prisoners ; an ad agency executive ; a tunnel police officer ; stallone ; and others .  we watch the trucks trundle toward their destination ; we watch stallone and so many others driving toward the tunnel for their various reasons .  and then , thirty minutes into the film , _boom_ .  and it's a big one .  >from there on in , it's sly stallone to the rescue .  and rescue he does , enduring batterings , beatings , falls , repeated immersion in 34-degree water , explosions , mud , rats , and constant setbacks , before going on to save the day , sly-style .  again . . . there's  nothing new here .  and yet there doesn't need to be .  the fun of _daylight_ is not in the story but in the execution .  the special-effects are first-rate , thanks to industrial light and magic , and the ensemble cast works well together .  once the film hits its stride , it carries the viewer right along to the finish , with very few jars along the way .  this review is copyright 1996 by christopher e . meadows .  permission granted for distribution through rec . arts . movies . reviews and all associated archival .  permission granted for free redistribution via cyberspace as long as this message remains attached .  all other rights reserved to the author .

1|"perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects .  there is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise .  whereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology .  the latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie's story .  unlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event .  it runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film's length .  contrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound .  in this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp .  with its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented .  the script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach .  but , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent .  the viewers don't care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner .  and right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story .  as the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind .  billions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- "" farms "" our life energy .  only a select group of individuals knows of the "" real "" world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) .  morpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth .  the cast plays out this story in stylish fashion .  the set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy .  the costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles .  for instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of "" agents "" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather .  the casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn't required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool .  supports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual .  one of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year's science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would've worked from a different approach .  the alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise .  the better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun .

1|"let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies .  i adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998's one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven .  was it any good ?  well , just about as good as baldwin's steven seagal impression ( for those i've confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) .  now let me clarify , i don't love just any cop movie ; i'm not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80's and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker .  i'm partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection .  problem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a "" true "" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail .  so what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ?  truth is i'm a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches .  yes it's all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i'm guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from .  as little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe's , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos .  as an adult my tastes haven't changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a "" guy "" film could potentially bring .  now what if it's the cops who're the corrupt ones ?  ooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain .  throw a courtroom drama ( yech ! )  into the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city .  how absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ?  so damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved .  the film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at .  since i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn't .   ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) .  like mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn't make it to where he should have .   ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) .  here , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino's in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) .  williams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york .  they work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes .  and that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done .  the squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice .  danny has done this , and though he's a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way .  he seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a "" double agent "" .  he does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners .  right away we know that that is exactly what he'll have to do .  and watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be .  undercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) .  how can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ?  prince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat .  lumet's greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action .  his scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking .  lumet's worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension .  this isn't as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet's most recent cop \ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching .  though of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot .  some of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic .  hollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable .  of course cop movies aren't popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn't gay , the lame comic relief character who's never funny , and on and on .  for all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills .  it focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies .  there's a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he's about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing .  this is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak .  in the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out .  he's lost his voice .  does that little itty bitty detail matter ?  maybe not to most , but it sure made my night .  and in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it's nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things .

1|"the soldiers of three kings have taken their cue from movies about vietnam .

( bush encouraged them to rise up against the government , but provided no military support for such cause . )  gates convinces the vault's guards that this is a post-war mission , and even accepts their assistance in loading the truck .  the situation could go off without a hitch : the former enemies bear no grudges .  but the money hungry gates has a conscience , and when one female bystander is shot by a sadistic grunt before these americans have left the scene , he orders barlow , elgin and vig to open fire on the surrounding arab forces .  the result : barlow is kidnapped , and the filmmakers imply that these would-be kings are seeing more action than they ever did during wartime .  barlow is eventually locked in a dank room and wired up to a shocking device .  his interrogator lost his family to the bombs , and he wants barlow to imagine the demise of his own wife and child .   ( he does , in chilling , lasting images . )  i liked these scenes best , because the political became personal .  it's one thing to champion the plight of thousands ; it's another to see a ceiling cave in atop a baby in a crib .  russell has shocked us before : his first film , spanking the monkey , is about a young man's affair with his bedridden mother .   ( it's great . )  his second , flirting with disaster , features a character who has an armpit fetish .  one could argue that it's easier to make an audience react to such sexual deviance than explosions , though ; russell disturbs us in three kings by being no-nonsense about the violence .  when barlow conjures the detonation of his suburban home , russell mutes the sound-we're paying attention to the debris instead of thx bombast .  three kings is russell's first visually arresting picture .  stylistically , it stands apart from other war dramas .  newton thomas sigel's cinematography of the exteriors is overexposed and extremely grainy , which is , of course , entirely appropriate .  one practically breaks out in sweat staring at the screen .   ( a friend enthusiastically added , "" it's like having sand in your eyes . "" )  this also helps to blur the fact that the actual locations are far removed from the persian gulf facade .   ( three kings was shot in arizona , california , and mexico . )  russell throws plenty at sigel's camera for it to observe-as was the case with russell's previous efforts , the most absurd moments are also the film's most realistic , even the most poignant .   ( we watch a bullet puncture an organ from the inside . )  if anything , three kings settles down and stops surprising us .  its climax is pure hollywood , no doubt the answer to why a major studio felt comfortable getting into bed with the indie-minded russell .  subsequently , the characters become more cartoonish-barlow's post-torture revelry felt phony , and chief , a strong presence in the first third , fails to escape the god-fearing-ultra-serious-anti-racist-black-man-of-power clich ? -so much for cube avoiding token status .   ( the arab players , on the other hand , duck stereotype . )  clooney , too , transforms into a blandly heroic protestor-marching with the rebels , i waited for him to shout , "" let my people go ! ""  hayseed vig notwithstanding , the protagonists are very intelligent , and self-serving , too ; i had a glimmer of hope , based on russell's filmography , that our antiheroes would revert to their greedy selves at some juncture .   ( it's not spoiling much to write that . )  then again , what historical importance would such nastiness serve ?   ( there's already enough cynicism in the film's mentioning of kuwait's oil-infested waters . )  russell offers the masses a primer on the oft-dismissed gulf conflict , and pulled off a neat trick : a war tale full of battles that takes place after a truce has been declared .  if he set out to make something socially/culturally/politically/globally significant , he succeeded .  with flair .

1|"bill condon's "" gods and monsters "" is a fascinating look into the last days in the life of gay director james whale ( ian mckellan ) , who made the horror classics "" frankenstein "" and "" bride of frankenstein . ""  since i was unfamiliar of whale prior to viewing the film , there is no way to know how accurate the film is , but i suspect that much of it only came from whale's inner fantasies and hallucinations .  whale , who fought in wwi and then went on to become known for his work on horror pictures , decided fifteen years before his death at age 67 to quit filmmaking once a homosexual scandal broke out involving him .  as the film tells it , during the end of his life , whale , at his large home in l . a . , became infatuated with the tall , handsome , and much younger man , clayton boone ( brendan fraser ) , who was working as the gardener at his home .  james whale , we learn quickly was , what many people refer to him as in the film , "" a dirty old man . ""  in one of the opening scenes , a young film enthusiast visits whale's home to interview him and whale agrees , on one condition : for every question he answers , the young man must take off an article of clothing .  because of this episode , we know exactly what it is whale wants when he asks clayton to pose for him for a painting , later making the excuse that his bright , white shirt is disracting only so he will take it off .  clayon agrees , and doesn't really think much of this , much to the warnings of his friends , becoming more and more intrigued in the stories whale tells him about his past .  certainly , the relationship between whale and boone is headed for a downfall , since whale starts to grow a deep love for this young man , even though boone is not gay , and whale himself realizes he is nearing the conclusion to his life , as he begins to seldom suffer mild strokes and moments of true catharsis .   "" gods and monsters "" is an intimate and seemingly respectful portrait of a director who was forced to become somewhat of an outcast , due to his sexual preference , and never got the recognition he would have liked , since he longed to be referred to as a "" motion picture director , "" rather than a "" horror director . ""  and in one heartbreaking scene , he attends a party with boone being his guest , held by director george cuckor , and finds that many of the other attendees do not recognize him anymore .  it is evident that whale's first love in his life was making movies , and when his career ultimately fell apart , so did his passion in life .  as played brilliantly by ian mckellen , james whale comes off as a sad , but dignified man , and a person who was not afraid to stand out from others , just as long as he knew he was being true to himself .  he never hid the fact that he was gay , however , even if it meant threatening his filmmaking profession , and it was this unblinking honesty that made him a great person .  through the complicated relationship that develops between whale and boone , boone , of course , only things of whale as a possible friend or someone he can talk to , while it means so much more to whale , who sees boone as sort of his salvation in life .  although boone is only in a dead-end job as a gardener of people's homes , whale views him as the ideal man , not only one that is good-looking , even though it is this attraction that first begins his feelings , but one that will actually listen to him .  since whale lives with only his loyal , but disapproving maid ( touchingly portrayed by lynn redgrave ) , it is boone that whale can talk to in his ultimate reclusion from the world , and the only reason whale finally decides to attend the gathering of george cuckor .  although an extremely fine and mature picture , a few small elements hold the film back from ultimate greatness .  it is appreciated that the film does not pull for any obvious or overly dramatic story developments , but it is a little thin , and the structuring of the "" on-again-off-again "" friendship at the film's center is fairly predictable .  we know early on where these two characters are headed , and we can guess that there will be a final confrontation between the two as the tension slowly builds .  in lesser hands , this set-up might have felt too calculated , but it is not in the surprisingly deft treatment and writing that helps the film to be much more than this .  also , a subplot is briefly brought up between clayton and a waitress working at a bar ( effectively played by lolita davidovich ) , but abruptly dropped and never brought up again .  if the film was not going to follow up on this side story , then it , perhaps , should have been taken out altogether .   "" gods and monsters "" is a heartfelt and intelligent motion picture , impressively directed by bill condon , who , i sense , relates to or fully understands the meaning behind the curious relationship between whale and boone .  the film also plays as a tribute to a fine man who met an untimely end .  walking away from "" gods and monsters , "" it was ian mckellen's marvelous and astounding performance that left the most impression on me , and i doubt there could have been anyone who could have stepped into the role more fully and believably .  it is a sad testament when a person's true talent and love is unfairly taken away from them , based on the scrutinization and judgement of their personal life , which , ironically enough , is no one else's business in the first place .

1|"i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of "" good will hunting "" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight .  the only problem is that will is a tough street kid who's had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he's being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight .  professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions .  this sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but "" good will hunting "" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama .  a conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will's therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting .  will finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau's attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle .  he also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her .  what makes "" good will hunting "" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will's life .  the script's sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong .  lambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we're not sure if we like what he has to say .  and sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will .  will's reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious "" right "" and "" wrong "" side and beating them over the head with it .  for a film with such an extraordinary character , "" good will hunting "" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another .  this film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation .   "" good will hunting "" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture .  and in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa .  will's relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the 'f' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will's character .  add all this to the fact that "" good will hunting "" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven't given this film four stars .  well , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original .  there are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions .  still , "" good will hunting "" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of '97 films .

1|"a cinematic version of one of john irving's novels is always cause for celebration even if , as in the case of "" simon birch , "" the treatment is merely "" suggested by , "" rather than strictly based on , the book .  suggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed "" the world according to garp , "" sold the rights to his novel "" a prayer for owen meany "" to the disney machine for $1 million , but wouldn't grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names .  that's an odd decision--irving claims it's to protect both himself and the novel--but it's one that doesn't unduly harm the finished product .  irving's books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters .   "" a prayer for owen meany "" is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy--called simon birch in the film version--who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice , "" like strangled mice . ""  simon believes himself to be "" god's instrument , "" placed on this earth to somehow effect god's plan .  simon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally .  smith's debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for "" simon birch "" ; however , the producers unwisely favored form over function--smith's acting abilities are limited at best .  another drawback is that in the book , simon's condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters--in careful , loving detail .  watching "" simon birch , "" however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended .  simon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith's rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he's forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film's director and screenwriter .  fortunately , simon birch isn't the real star of the film that bears his name .  simon is more of a catalyst , allowing his co-stars to shape the story , and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances , saving the film from an obsequious , manipulative destiny .  first and foremost is joseph mazzello ( "" jurassic park "" ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon's best friend , joe .  mazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent .  ashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca , joe's single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben .  david strathairn and jan hooks play the town's reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others .  there's even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from . . .  well , that would be telling .  perhaps "" suggested by "" the novel is the appropriate way to go after all , since "" simon birch "" only focuses on one chapter , one year , of simon's extraordinary life .  the film also changes the book's ending to one that is more melodramatic , yet necessary given simon's lot .  the flavor of irving's original novel remains , however--the passions , friendships , and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown , maine , and the engaging oddballs , both big and small , who reside there .

1|"the only historical figure that has been written about more than william shakespeare is jesus christ , which explains why the bard's materials are such a popular source for remakes , revisions , rewrites , inspiration , subtlety , credit , and dispute .  indeed , in recent years , american contemporary cinema has been swamped with a wash of shakespearean products .  including this year's upcoming a midsummer night's dream , shakespeare's material has been the cause for twenty-six big screen productions since 1990 .  but for a change of pace , mrs .  brown director john madden gives us a story of the bard himself in the wonderfully vibrant shakespeare in love .  marc norman and tom stoppard's story is largely fantasy , although as the viewer soon learns , shakespeare in love is not a movie that takes itself seriously .   ( will shakespeare of the 1590's would've been married to anne hathaway , and he would've had a teenage daughter and two young sons ; here he is a bachelor played by joseph fiennes . ) will is a writer struggling to come up with a great play , and his current comedy in the works -- "" romeo and ethel , the pirate's daughter "" -- just doesn't quite seem right .  with the help of the great writer christopher marlowe ( rupert everett ) , and the inspiration of true love with noblewoman viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) , he changes things around and writes one of his greatest tragedies , "" romeo and juliet . ""  the love story between will and viola loosely parallels the story of romeo and juliet , to great effect .  fiennes and paltrow develop a sexy chemistry as the two lovers which gives the movie much momentum ; this momentum smoothes out the bumps in the unfinished and largely unsuccessful comedy .  the supporting roles are well filled out , from geoffrey rush as will's worrisome agent , philip , to tom wilkinson as the producer hugh fennyman .  even ben affleck , leading the troupe of actors , manages to make a favorable impression ; and judi dench lends some brief moments of screen time as queen elizabeth i . gwyneth paltrow is by far , however , the standout of the lot , creating a large percentage of the forementioned vibrance .  the story is well-crafted if nothing else , although it has dangerous moments where it flirts with the "" let's make a movie "" -genre .  the dialogue is breezy and lighthearted , and certainly accessible by the audience's lowest common denominator .  there's something for everyone in this romantic comedy , making it prime date flick material .  although certainly not inspiring in any regard , it revels in a wholesome , well-rounded atmosphere that has been absent in many of 1998's pictures ; the true-love story is one of the best around .  certainly recommendable when the traditional slew of indifferent year's-open releases is just around the corner .
