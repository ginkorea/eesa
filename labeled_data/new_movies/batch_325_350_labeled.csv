1|"i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival .  'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation' , the headlines read .  intrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years .  even though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn't help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated .  only now do i see the error of my ways .  after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a "" holocaust comedy "" ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps .  rather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation .  roberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) .  through the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this "" beautiful princess "" , as he calls her .  employing the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) .  life treats them well until hitler's minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son's innocence no matter what the sacrifice .  granted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a "" hogan's heros "" and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews .  somehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it's gravely serious subject .  so , we've established that life is beautiful is not a "" holocaust comedy "" .  but , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me .  the film , despite critic's declarations of it being a "" triumph of the human spirit "" , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway .  some have called the story an "" affirmation of the beauty of life "" , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man's capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy .  the film's ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting .  essentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film .  however , i am not denying the movie's greatness .  believe me , it's fantastic .  i'm just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as .  but perhaps i'm reading more into the movie than is really there .  maybe the film's brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit .  in fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it .

1|"most movies seem to release a third movie just so it can be called a trilogy .  rocky iii seems to kind of fit in that category , but manages to be slightly unique .  the rocky formula of "" rocky loses fight/rocky trains/rocky wins fight "" is carried out to the letter .  also the 'tradition' of showing the last five minutes or so from the past rocky film is used as well .  this movie begins with a series of clips showing how famous rocky ( sylvester stallone ) has become . . .  even showing a brief appearance on sesame street ! !  then it moves on with rocky being in a fixed fight with thunderlips ( hulk hogan ) .  a mysterious bad-ass known as clubber lang ( mr . t ) trash-talks to rocky about his stupid decision to retire from boxing and that he "" pities the fool "" for not coming out and fighting him outright .  rocky's trainer ( burgess meredith ) tells rocky not to fight , but the italian stallion doesn't listen .  naturally , he gets his ass kicked .  somewhere along the line after this several things happen .  rocky's longtime trainer dies , causing rocky to train with his former opponent apollo creed .  rocky's wife complains to her husband that he should fight .  the final fight ensues between clubber and rocky .  guess who wins ?  the winner's name rhymes with 'smocky' .  the movie is entertaning mainly because of clubber lang's over the top performance .  the dramatic aspect has been toned down considerably since rocky ii and now action seems to be the strong point of the film .  which is good if you like fighting scenes .  the last match is quite decent actually .  if you liked the previous films , rent this one .  it's well worth seeing if you are a fan of the series .  but if you can't stand rocky shouting "" adrianne ! ! !

1|review : a dog of flanders is the story of an adorable little boy named nello and his trials and tribulations in 19th century flanders .  living with his grandfather jehan ( jack warden ) in poverty , nello finds happiness in his life in spite of difficult times ( they are renting a spare one-room cottage , and the greedy , malevolent landlord who owns it threatens to throw them `out of the house' if they don't pay the rent ) .  nello also has a rather creative talent for drawing some of the most beautiful pictures that i have ever seen , in either a movie or in real life .   ( his hero is peter paul rubens , the great flemish painter of the 17th century . )  not that these are the only things that make nello's life happy , however .  he has a dog of flanders , whom he names patrasche , who is a heroic rin-tin-tin of the 19th century , whom he rescues from his cruel , unkind master .  in addition , he even has a best friend ( and future sweetheart ) in the lovely , wealthy aloise , whose father strongly disapproves of her hanging out with `lower-class' nello .   ( he thinks he's not good enough for her , and he would hate the idea of the two kids marrying . )  but then , he was a poor guy himself before he married ( as mentioned later on in the film ) .  one day , nello encounters a mysterious , yet kindhearted artist named michel la grande ( played wonderfully by jon voight ) , who tells the boy to keep drawing from his heart , and that perhaps one day he might land a career in being an artist .  and every christmas , there is a contest on which is the most beautiful painting of the year ; the winner getting a lot of money .  eager to save his home ( and his aging , dying grandfather ) , nello willingly decides to become an artist , asking aloise to pose for him .  one night , the two travel to a circus , where they have their fortune told ? one of the film's most delightful scenes ? that great happiness is destined for them .  she gives the kids a ring , whom nello places on aloise's hand .   ; ) afterwards , the two kids have a rollickingly good time dancing around in front of circus performers .  unfortunately , things are not all `la-dee-dah' in this tale .  aloise's father finally becomes so angry with nello that he forbids him to ever see aloise again .  bad enough that they can't see each other ( although we know nello and aloise , don't we ? ) , but that's only the start of nello's troubles .  aloise's farm is burned down , and nello is wrongfully accused ( by the landord of his cottage ) for starting the fire in order to take revenge on being forbidden to see aloise .  this decreases nello's reputation around the town , save aloise and her parents , and a kindly miller , william , who is very sweet to nello every time he drops by .  matters get much worse for nello when his grandfather dies , and he has to pay for his funeral .  but then things really get nasty when the landlord exiles nello from his own home ( for not paying his rental ) ? permanetly .  this means that nello and patrasche have to starve and walk out in the cold , freezing wind .  worst of all , the painting that he has desperately been working on during all this time , `the portrait of the princess' , fails to win the prize at the festival .  now nello and patrasche are really depressed , and close to freezing to death .  will nello be able to find any happiness in his life ?  will patrasche save the day ?  will nello make the fateful trip to join his mother and grandfather in paradise ?  a dog of flanders is a delightful , heartwarming family film that is sure to entertain kids of all ages .  even older ones who consider themselves too `sophisticated' for kiddie fare will be surprised to hear that this film is for grown-ups , too .  there have been other movies of this ilk ( boy and dog ) , and while this one falls into that category , it is mostly a story about overcoming difficulties and finding a good home for yourself .  move over ? or rather , roll over ? old yeller , this dog of flanders is a heartwarming delight .  the cinematography , courtesy of walther van den ende is beautiful , and really adds to the powerful drama of the film .  it also gives a feel of being in flanders ( the whole film was respectably shot in flanders ) .  the music from richard friedman is also remarkable ; an evocative , poignant score that recaptures music from the 19th century .  the opening song over the credits is very beautiful ( i hope the soundtrack is available ! ) , and there's a brief excerpt of `cheer up , charlie' from willy wonka and the chocolate factory ( sung by aloise , to nello , in another delightful scene ) .  the cast is first-rate : jesse james and jeremy james kissner , who play nello , are some of the most endearing , adorable young stars i have ever seen in my whole life ( so are the girls who play aloise , madyline sweeten as the younger , and farren monet as the older ) .  not that they are the only good stars , however .  jack warden is ideal as jehan , eliciting just the right amount of humor and compassion required for the character .   ( the scenes involving him and nello are heartwarming , touching ones . )  also , bruce mcgill is charming as the kindly miller william .  he's another one of my favorite characters in the film .  but jon voight , as i mentioned before , is the perfect choice for michel .  he brings a mysterious , yet gentle performance that makes us all feel good again when he reassures insecure nello that he * can * win the contest .  but what makes this film fun to watch is how well-defined the characters are , and the pace of the story ( best of all , it has a happy ending ? though i will * not * give it away ; sorry ) is strong and powerful enough for us to identify with the characters .  for the first time since the beginning of 1999 , there comes a film which doesn't rely on popular formula stuff , such as big-budget special effects , commercial rock soundtracks , or any of that stuff .  this one relies on telling a fully character-oriented story , with just the right amount of heart , humor , and drama .  that , to me , is what makes a dog of flanders all the more delightful .  eleanor o'sullivan of `the home news & tribune' noticed this , and was kind and generous enough to welcome it : `for want of a better word , a glow surrounds a dog of flanders .  its heart is in the right place and it engages you .  you can guess where the film is going because this is well-traveled territory , but with pros like voight and appealing young performers like kissner , an often-told story is well worth a revisit . '  in addition , there were a couple of other enthusiasts , such as chicago-sun times and the washington post ( you should read their reviews ; they're really positive ) .  other critics , however , were not so kind .  stephen holden of `the new york times' had more than a share of beatings to lay upon a dog of flanders via pen writing .  he found the film to be a `sea of sugary bromides' and condemned mr . voight's character as `hopelessly wooden ? adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one he came up with for anaconda . '  in addition , `entertainment weekly' slam-dunked the film , condemning it as `the worst family film of the year . '  there have been so many other bad reviews like this , too .  my suggestion : disregard the critics .  they just have a big problem with touching family films , and one should never pay attention to them .  this dog of flanders may only be a little `family' movie ( it probably won't be a big hit in the style of titanic , but then again no other film has been since then ) , but that is not a bad thing in and of itself .  this is a story that is sure to warm your heart , and that is what really matters about a dog of flanders .  it is also one of the better family films around this year .  none of the other films i have seen this year ( though they were good ) have been so low-key and touching .  if you're looking for family-style entertainment , look no further than this charming boy-and-dog yarn .  go see it while you still can , for as i mentioned , it might not be a big bow-wow at the box office for a long time .  see it while you can .  there is really no need to compare a multi-million dollar blockbuster such as star wars : episode i ? the phantom menace or tarzan , or even the iron giant with a tender , sweet little family movie .  |0.3|0.8000000000000002|0.9|The review overall provides a slightly positive sentiment, highlighting aspects like an adorable little boy overcoming challenges, finding happiness, a talented artist, and positive elements of the movie such as cinematography, music, and performances.

1|"do film critics have morals ?  are there any unwritten laws an ethical movie critic would or should follow ?  naturally we don't want to go into a film with any preconceived notions , which is pretty tough but something we all have to accomplish .  secondly , and along the same line , we can't prejudge a film because of it's stars , director , etc . the difference ?  well , in the first one , we'd go into a film thinking it's going to be dumb or it's going to be good , and that would affect our viewing ( that movie sounds and looks dumb , so i'm not expecting much ) .  on the second hand , we're simply assuming it will be bad or good because of a personal "" grudge "" against the film company ( it's made by disney ?  oh , it's just a merchandising ploy then ) , the actors ( jim carrey's in it ?  it's gonna stink ! ) , or the director ( who ?  can't be that good ) .  this is more of a biased viewpoint as opposed to a first impression viewpoint .  make sense ?  ok , but what about comparing ?  isn't that kind of along the same lines ?  when we compare a certain actor or director or even composer's credibility in one film to another they were involved in , is that really fair ?  sure , in sequels you can expect and accept comparisons a lot more , but what about jackie brown , for example ?  is it fair for me to take the review and turn it into a comparison of pulp fiction , just because quentin tarantino directed and wrote the screenplay for both ?  i think it is , and i'll tell you why .  a good critic should be able to view the film from the "" average joe ( or jane ) "" viewpoint , while still taking into account the artistic integrity behind the film .  sometimes that can be tough .   "" the acting was superb , but i was bored "" or "" i loved it ! !  it was sooooo cheezy ! ""  might be used to describe a film .  these are contradictions , and a critic has to weigh both sides and come to a suitable balanced critique .  but which is more important ?  and which is better ?  an extremely well shot and acted film that is boring , or a really amateurish film that you wanna go back to again and again ?  getting back to the point , my philosophy on comparing films being fair works because we're reflecting what the public wants to know anyway .  every average person out there who's interested in this film is likely to ask "" how does it compare to pulp fiction ? ""  and so , as a critic , i'm already responsible to ask that same question .  jackie brown stars pam grier , the "" blaxploitation "" heroine from the 1970's , who is likely to make a big comeback thanks to her role as the title character .  tarantino's pulp fiction is in big part responsible for john travolta's sudden revival in the movie industry , and with talks of an oscar nomination , the same is likely to happen for grier .   ( we've made it thru comparison #1 ! ) jackie is a 44-year-old airline stewardess who brings in extra cash , and probably her main revenue , by smuggling large sums of money into the united states for ordell robbie ( pulp fiction's samuel l . jackson and comparison #2 ) .  ordell is in the illegal firearms business and has enlisted the aid of louis gara ( robert de niro ) , a bank robber who just got out of prison after serving four years , to help him accomplish a scheme worth a half- million dollars .  trouble arises when jackie is stopped by atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) and taken into custody for possession of narcotics , as well as having more money than is allowed in an airport without being claimed .  naturally this proves an obstacle to ordell's plans and , not as friendly intended as we'd hope , he posts jackie's bail after she is put behind bars .  the thing is , ordell is in this for no one more than himself , and as we learn from his previous actions , he's willing to kill anyone who stands in the way .  jackie finds herself in a tight squeeze .  ordell won't think twice about taking her out if she fails to help him as she's always done , yet at the same time , a compromise with the authorities would be in order if evidence against ordell was provided .  it comes down to a simple question : would jackie rather face ordell or prison ?  what ensues is a rich and intriguing example of storytelling as we question who jackie is really out to help : the law , ordell , or maybe just herself .  coming into play is another 70's veteran , robert forster as jackie's bail bondsmen max cherry .  max's obvious fondness for jackie will become a major benefactor in her fight to beat both sides of the system , and forster plays him with subtle charm that adds depth to unbrewed romance .  also involved is ordell's "" surfer girl "" girlfriend melanie ( bridget fonda ) , a ditzy sun- bleached babe who spends her time watching tv with a bong in hand .  fonda does the best she can with an essentially thin role , but there's nothing more to her , and therefore , she becomes a tossable addition to an otherwise flourishing bouquet of characters .  de niro is also wasted in his role as a quiet nobody crook out to score a few bucks for himself .  de niro is a brilliant actor , but a character who hardly ever speaks doesn't need a de niro to play him .  compared to pulp fiction ( comparison #3 ) , the characters in jackie brown and very thin and replaceable .  in pulp fiction , even the small , seemingly irrelevant characters were wonderful , complete , and lifelike , whereas jackie brown has such common figures that it wouldn't have suffered much with a lesser talented cast , the exception being grier .  tarantino wrote this script with grier specifically in mind , so to say that she is made for this role is a reversed truth .  sadly , grier too could have received a bit more attention , especially when the story is all about her newly-jarred perception of life .  jackson teams up with tarantino again , but the chemical reaction isn't as awesome as the first time .  jules was the rambling , bible-quoting hitman in pulp fiction , and jackson is the only person who could have pulled it off .  and although jackson is really , really good in jackie brown , i don't think he's quite as irreplaceable .  in fact , maybe a new face would have been better .  jackson could've remained tarantino's jules , and a new guy could have become ordell , forever to remain so in our memories .  sadly , these characters are too much the same , except ordell just isn't as impressive , and putting this in the hands of jackson once again is only going to deter from our fond recollections of jules .  another problem is that ordell is way too focused on in the beginning .  this is grier's film , so why spend so long getting to know a man who will become more of a supporting character as the film progresses ?  it not only makes the movie feel a little too slanted , but it makes for a slow beginning because we have to take longer getting to the meat of the story .  it is likely that those pouring into the theater to see this film are going to be those anxious to partake of tarantino's quirky dialogue and eccentric directing style , and not so much those interested in seeing a silver screen adaption of elmore leonard's novel "" rum punch "" .  for those movie-goers , don't expect another pulp fiction and you'll be satisfied , for the script oozes with the familiar brash qualities that has made tarantino an icon of 90's film- making .  the directing has toned down a bit , however , yet we're still reminded that this is tarantino's movie thanks to odd split-screen story-telling devices and scenes being replayed multiple times from different viewpoints .  so getting back to the question that i began with , this isn't pulp fiction at all .  it's good , but it isn't anything that made pulp fiction such a revolutionary effort in the first place .  this is a more conservative tarantino , but not one that won't satiate true fans .  if you can realize that this isn't going to knock your socks off , then you'll be happy to at least let it massage your feet .  after all , we all know how much tarantino loves that particular part of the human anatomy .

1|"'contact' shows why jodie foster is one of our best actresses .  see contact with your family .  it is a movie for all ages .  --a review by stuart cracraft  contact starring : jodie foster , matthew mcconaughey , john hurt director : robert zemeckis star  after a predictable mit phillip morrison powers-of-10 zoom-out start ( which can be surprising to those not familiar with prof . morrison's work ) , contact picks up steam , gradually , building , by-the-end , an irresistable juggernaut and a very good movie that does not as is so often the case fall out-of-balance in terms of too much pandering to the technological "" geek "" side .  by the end , the audience is left with what good science fiction is supposed to do : evoke a sense of wonder about the universe and evoke questions in your mind about what's out there .  this movie does not let technology overshadow characterization and in this sense it is unusual amongst high-tech movies .  however , except for jodie foster ( elie arroway ) and john hurt ( s . r .  hadden ) , who are both actors of exceptional caliber , the supporting cast are not especially impressive .  hurt certainly has had better roles ( stephen ward in scandal ) .  this one , as the multi-billionare hadden , does not do his acting skills justice .  this is clearly a foster movie by one of the great hollywood lights of our generation .  foster's radiance has never been more strong than in the scene where she finally meets the vegans on their terms .  early scenes take a long , long time to build up to this .  the movie's pacing is very good and subtle .  the panoramas of the radio dishes at arecibo and ceti in new mexico and puerto rico are beautiful .  the politics of foster's character attempting to obtain funding for research at these places are trite and predictable however .  one of the most entertaining , but very short scenes , is when foster is confronted by rob lowe , during a cabinet-level presidential meeting to discuss the alien invitation .  there were real sparks in this scene between foster and lowe and it would behoove them to consider other vehicles in which this dynamism could be explored .  it is the only scene in the movie in which there were tremendous dynamics between two characters .  everything else was very one-sided ( e . g .  foster ) .  lowe can stand up to foster and it showed in that scene at the cabinet table .  the core scene of the movie is set on a surrealistic beach on a far-away world in the starsystem of vega .  it feels a lot like science fiction writer john varley's scenes in his book steel beach , where the female protagonists encounters an immensely superior intelligence , in one case a computer manufactured by mankind itself , and in foster's case , an illusion drawn from her memory .  in another sense , this immensely moving scene evokes gene roddenberry's star trek pilot the cage , later the menagerie , when jeffrey hunter and susan oliver have their memories manipulated to create new worlds in which they live and encounter aliens .  the concept is not new , by any sense , in the world of science fiction .  but the beach scene , which is the centerpiece of the film , as is the whole film , is driven by foster .  freed from her needs to direct by director zemecki , foster is able to let it all hang out in the characterization and the lead she provides to her supporting cast .  as the movie gains speed , foster's acting intensifies and the audience really does experience it with her .  it is certainly oscar-caliber acting , unquestionably .  the supporting cast does well and zemeckis throws in some humor with some president clinton cameos , cleverly manipulated , george stephanopolus-style , to seem very forrest gump .  in fact , zemeckis et .  al .  got in trouble for the usage of some of the footage seen in the movie , vis a vis clinton .  but the audience i attended this movie with just had some good chuckles at clinton's walk-ons .  the much-discussed tension between science and religion in this movie is not particularly insightful to those who have already gone through this course though it is helpful to those in the audience who have not .  also , the near-final scene , in a senate judiciary hearing room is disappointing .  contact is a fitting memorial to the memory of carl sagan , science popularizer , and sometime pedantic gadfly of the halls of academe .  perhaps now , sagan can be said to be with his dragons of eden .

""  what will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance .  however , what helps "" at first sight "" rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy .  usually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer "" you've got mail "" immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight .  the film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil .  the massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual "" love scenes , "" and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two .  these joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy's eventful life in the "" big city . ""  the other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board .  val kilmer , usually cast in the "" macho "" type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears .  it was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off .  mira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995's hilarious woody allen comedy , "" mighty aphrodite , "" for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here .  although she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997's "" mimic , "" 1998's "" the replacement killers "" ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with "" at first sight "" that she finally has another juicy role to play .  in a truthful climactic scene set in amy's apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces .  kelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the "" bad , "" one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother .  finally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist .  the one misstep of "" at first sight "" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil .  very little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes .  perhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder .  in "" awakenings , "" the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed .  because of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film's few problems can be swept over to the side .  the adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) .  since january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , "" at first sight "" comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace .

1|"in the company of men made a splash at the sundance film festival because , in a year plagued by brothers mcmullen-style , earnestly shallow gen-x angst pictures , it seemed to be actually about something .  it angered people , started arguments outside the theater , riled things up .  it ignited a spark of excitement in what otherwise has been a disappointing year for independent film .  having endured my share of the hype , i waited calmly for men to reach the hinterlands wherein i reside , and then checked in to see what all the fuss was about .  does men live up to its press ?  well , yes it does .  and it may make you think twice before you consider dating anyone your office .  for the uninitiated , newcomers aaron eckhart and matt malloy play chad and howard , two corporate drones who are dispatched by their nameless company to a remote branch office for a six week assignment .  chad and howard are archetypes , examples of which you can no doubt find in your own place of business .  chad is the blond golden boy , genetically engineered for success , the natural charmer who seems to glide effortlessly up the corporate ladder .  howard is chad's boss , but he is weaker of will , the clumsy practitioner of office politics who has achieved his position through dogged persistence rather than raw talent .  we first meet them awaiting their flight in a drab airport lounge .  there chad suggests a scheme worthy of a shakespearean villain : he and howard will find a vulnerable single woman at the branch office , woo her simultaneously , win her love , and then dump her .  the reason ?  both men have recently been dumped themselves , and chad sees an easy route to revenge against the fairer sex .   "" it'll restore a little dignity to our lives , "" he says .  howard , helpless against the force of chad's will , agrees to the plan .  they quickly spot their prey in the form of christine ( stacy edwards ) , a fragile deaf woman working as a temp .  chad moves in for the kill , flashing his golden boy smile , plying christine with lunch , then flowers , then dinner .  howard follows suit , though his efforts are in contrast ham-handed and desperate .  flattered to have the attention of two eligible men , christine dates them both .  you can guess which one she falls for .  soon a tragic lovers' triangle develops : christine loves chad , chad loves himself , and howard loves christine on the grounds that , since she's handicapped and shy , she just might be wretched and lonely enough to settle for him .  adult social interaction never really progresses beyond the level of junior high , does it ?  in chad , writer/director labute and actor eckhart have created one of the most chilling monsters ever committed to film-hannibal lector may eat human flesh , but chad is an eater of souls .  his evil is as subtle as a viper's , and as easy as his smile .  we watch in stunned disbelief as he back-stabs coworkers , humiliates his subordinates , and works his deadly venom into christine's heart .  his character would be a joke if he wasn't so chillingly real- all of us have worked with a chad , and some of us may be him .  he's the guy who takes your job and then laughs at you for your weakness .  if one of his co-workers should happen to go postal and walk into the office with a bag full of handguns , he had best have his escape route clearly in mind .  politics is his game , and the modern cubicle-filled office is his playground .  men wears the guise of a black comedy , but it functions best as allegory .  the most controversial moment in the film happens when chad humiliates a black temp by asking him how badly he wants to succeed in the company , then forces him to prove it in a manner i won't describe .  the scene is charged with racism and fraught with peril .  could it happen in the real world ?  probably not .  taken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society .  maybe it's just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience .  the entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive .  the marvel of labute's multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way .  but does the film work as entertainment ?  its darned funny in spots , particularly in the men's room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions .  it works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers .  stacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her .  likewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions .  by the end of the film you'll feel as if you've met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film .  certainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed .  but the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time .  like all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world .  while watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn't help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs .  there may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art .

1|the booming introduction music finishes , and the camera sweeps over red mountains .  we see two figures looking over a barren , and very red landscape .  they kiss , then walk on .  one of the characters ( schwarzenegger ) slips , and falls .  the glass on his mask cracks .  his face scruches up , and his eye's begin to pop . . . . .  then doug quaid , played by schwarzenegger , wakes up .  it's all been a dream .  he wakes up next to his beautiful wife , played by stone , and the film begins . . .  total recall is a typical sci-fi film wrapped around an intresting ( if far fetched ) plot .  quaid , who has never been to mars , keeps on having dreams of the planet , which has now been colanised .  one day , while riding on a train , he's see's a ad for a company called 'rekall' , which implants memories of a holiday , instead of you actually going there yourself .  quaid chooses the 'secret agent on mars' memory , and then the s * * * really hits the fan .  the implant goes wrong , and quaid really thinks he is an agent on mars for about two minutes , until he goes back to normal and can't remember a thing .  however , everyone he knows ( his workmates , his wife ) turn against him , saying how 'blabbed about mars' and 'blew his cover on the mission' a strange man , called richter , played by ironside , wants to kill him .  quaid , now hopelessly confused , follows the advice given to him , by a 'friend' .  he get's his ass to mars .  mars is ruled by cohagen , played by cox , who charges people for air .  against him are the rebels , who are mainly mutants .  the rebel's need quaid to defeat cohagen , because quaid knows ( but can't remember yet ) about a reactor that produces air .  eventually , quaid kills cohagen , turns on the reactor , saves the planet , and goes away with a beautiful girl , just like the guy at rekall promised him .  throughout this plot , there is huge explosions , thousands of deaths ( and i mean a lot of death ) swearing , sex , and everything else that make's a good verhoeven ( director of basic instinct and starship troopers ) movie .  naturally , there's some pretty imaginative deaths , with arms getting ripped off , someone getting drilled , and heads exploding .  as you can tell , it's violent stuff .  but it's done so stylishly , and of course arnie tones it down with a one liner , that's it excusable .  the acting is variable .  arnie , of course , is useless , but he goes has some good lines , and in the first twenty minutes , he even act's like a normal bloke , not like some action hero .  stone , of course , is useless , making a pretty poor wife , and a pretty poor action hero .  but , she does sex scenes alright .  ticoton ( most recently seen in con air ) , again , is ok , doing some good action , but getting her emotions all wrong .  one minute she hates quaid , the next she loves him , and she never gets this tranisition right .  so , the good guys are awful .  but , the bad guy's are excellent .  cox is basically reprising robocop , but he's still great in this , and he delivers the best line in the whole film near the end .  ironside is superbly evil , with an utterly emotionless face .  the supporting cast are fine , and not even the comedy sidekick ( this time in the form of a taxi driver ) is annoying .  one disappointing aspect , though , are the special effects .  ilm and dreamquest do some good work ( such as a subway station scene ) but the model work is not so good .  some of the model heads look appaling fake , and quatto is a major disappointment .  another irritating thing is the product placement .  there are a lot of plugs ( and a good mars today gag ) however , the sets look great , and the special effects at the end of the film aren't too bad either .  there's also a good soundtrack running through , by jerry goldsmith ( the omen , poltergeist , star trek : the motion picture )  overall , then , total recall is a hugely violent , yet hugely enjoyable , action fest , with a reasonable plot thrown in there too , some great bad guys , and some imaganitive death .  for a schwarzenegger movie , this is not bad at all .  in fact , it's very good .  |0.2333333333333333|0.8333333333333334|0.7666666666666666|"The overall sentiment is positive as the movie ""Total Recall"" is described as hugely enjoyable with a reasonable plot, great bad guys, and imaginative death scenes.

1|jonathan demme's _beloved_ , based on the book toni morrison , is a study in skillful literary adaptation .  on the one hand , the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel , evoking morrison's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice .  on the other hand , beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book , favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story's main events .  this choice is a smartly made one , for it creates an open space in which the story's wide range of emotions can gestate and grow .  indeed , the impact of the film is so protracted that much of it cannot be felt until long after the end credits have rolled .  _beloved_ takes place in the second half of the 19th century , during the so-called reconstruction era after the civil war .  for newly-freed slaves , it is a time of confusion and turmoil .  oprah winfrey is sethe , a slave who escaped a kentucky plantation and took her children to an ohio farmhouse , where she hoped the terror would end .  what she did not know was that it would follow her there , and remain with her long after the physical threat had vanished .  _beloved_ ultimately tells the story of sethe's search for forgiveness , one long-hampered by an unforgettable sin .  the film starts off on a dreary day ten years after sethe's escape , as a violent , unseen energy rocks her dilapidated farmhouse .  invisible hands terrorize her family , flinging objects across rooms , shaking tables , rattling floorboards .  sethe's sons run away , perhaps for good , leaving sethe and her daughter denver to fend for themselves .  demme's matter-of-fact handling of this supernatural element is just one of _beloved_'s intriguing aspects .  all of the characters take for granted that ghosts are real .  when paul d ( danny glover ) -- a former slave who escaped kentucky along with sethe -- arrives at the house eight years later and is confronted with the ghost's hellish visions , he doesn't run in terror .  instead , he asks who the ghost is .  as in morrison's novel , demme quickly establishes that the horror of the story will not come from the fact of the ghost itself , but from the terrifying past in which the ghost was created .  sethe is the one being haunted , but the ghost in the house is the least of her fears .  in fact , the ghost is one of the reasons she chooses to stay .  the story takes an bizarre turn with the appearance of beloved ( thandie newton ) , a young black-clad woman who appears on sethe's front lawn , leaned christ-like against a tree stump .  sethe and denver immediately take to the rasping woman and try to nurse her to health .  they know not who she is , but that doesn't matter .  only paul d is suspicious of the stranger .  little does the family know that beloved will bring about many changes , and force sethe to release a guilt she has held onto so urgently for eighteen years .  winfrey is arguably beloved's greatest asset .  she inhabits the role of sethe so convincingly it is hard to believe this is the same woman who shines brightly on a tv talk show .  lisa gay hamilton does an impressive job in the emotionally demanding role as the younger sethe , whose appalling actions make her the disturbed woman we see eighteen years later .  danny glover is affable as the sympathetic paul d , as is kimberly elise as denver , sethe's wanderlusting daughter .  as sethe's sage-like mother-in-law old baby suggs , beah richards authoritatively commands every scene in which she appears .  the film's least palatable choice of casting is unfortunately that of the role of beloved herself .  thandie newton plays the glassy-eyed girl with a demented fervor which is endearing at first , but which becomes off-putting and unintentionally laughable by the end .  departing from the honed aesthetic he used in such films as _the silence of the lambs_ and _melvin & howard_ , director demme has used a bit of dramatic overstatement to get across the vivid descriptions in morrison's novel .  totemic camera shots and color-saturated scenery are decidedly uncommon in demme's films , but the few he uses here work to the film's benefit .  _beloved_'s most memorable scenes are those of baby suggs' gatherings in a forest clearing , where the bright yellow-greens of nature entrance the viewer as much as suggs' words do .  for the most part , though , demme maintains his trademark directorial neutrality .  this , combined with morrison's equally frugal method of storytelling , may make _beloved_ somewhat of a challenge to watch , even to those familiar with the book .  though the film compliments the book extraordinarily well , it falls short in allowing the sort of accessibility one usually expects from a film .  nothing is spoon-fed to the viewer .  morrison's novel is just as enigmatic , but unlike a movie , a book can be put down to allow the various undercurrents and themes to churn and absorb .  the movie begins like _poltergeist_ , and ends like _the color purple_ , with shades of _the scarlet letter_ and _little women_ somewhere in the middle .  taken as a whole , beloved is a disquieting , one-of-a-kind experience , one to be viewed with guards down and spirits in abeyance .  |0.4283333333333334|0.7999999999999999|0.7999999999999999|The sentiment

1|"scream 2 isn't quite as clever as its predecessor , but it fills the gap with a cutting wit .  death -- even gruesome , bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way ( some will be offended by this statement , but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example ) .  and , while there's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2 , the latest '90s slasher flick incarnation , there are also a few laughs to be had .  scream 2 is a slice-and-dice movie for those who don't take their horror too seriously .  the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise .  the unexpected blockbuster , whose gross soared over the $100 million mark during its six month release window , opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time .  a sequel was inevitable ; fortunately , nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2 , including director wes craven , screenwriter kevin williamson , and actors neve campbell , courtney cox , david arquette , jamie kennedy , and liev schreiber .  as stipulated by one of the "" rules of sequels "" uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film , the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original .  paradoxically , there's a lot less gore .  there is blood , of course , but nothing excessive by slasher-movie standards , and there are no depictions of spilled entrails .  craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids .  a second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut-out stereotypes lined up for slaughter .  after all , we've known some of these people for two movies -- it's almost impossible not to care about them at least a little .  scream 2 opens approximately two years after the original .  as in the first picture , there's a slick , self-mocking prologue .  this time , the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps , whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab ( which is based on the "" true life "" events of scream ) .  some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films ( it's surely no coincidence that , in addition to pinkett and epps , scream 2 features two black characters ) .  shortly thereafter , she and her boyfriend have been gutted , signaling the beginning of a series of copycat murders .  craven lets loose a burst of tongue-in-cheek creativity for the "" movie within a movie "" sequences .  they give him an opportunity to openly parody scream -- an act that he accomplishes with great panache .  stab features heather graham in the "" casey becker "" role ( played in the original by drew barrymore ) and tori spelling as "" sidney prescott "" ( neve campbell ) .  sadly , we only see a couple of scenes from stab .  it would have been a little more fun , i think , had craven used joe dante's approach from matinee and shown lengthy excerpts from his satirical production .  following the prologue , we are re-introduced to sidney prescott , who has left her sleepy hometown to go to windsor college .  her friend randy ( jamie kennedy ) is a student there as well , and he's just as knowledgeable about horror films as ever .  once the double murder at stab becomes big news , the media converges on windsor , looking to interview the original victim .  at the head of the flock of vultures is gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who has a little surprise for sidney .  she has brought cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , the man sidney falsely accused of murder , with her .  also arriving at the college is deputy dewey ( david arquette ) , who is there to act as a big brother to sidney during this latest round of tribulations .  in addition to the survivors from the original scream , the field of potential victims is well-populated .  there's a blond co-ed named cece ( sarah michelle gellar , who has now appeared in two of williamson's movies -- this one and i know what you did last summer ) ; sidney's requisite boyfriend , derek ( jerry o'connell ) ; a local newswoman ( laurie metcalf ) ; gale's new cameraman ( duane martin ) ; a british drama teacher ( david warner ) ; and several sorority sisters and would-be sorority sisters ( portia de rossi , rebecca gayheart , elise neal , marisol nichols ) .  ultimately , there are lots of attractive corpses .  from the stab scenes to lines like "" brothers don't last long in situations like this , "" craven and williamson are clearly having a lot of fun with scream 2 , and the movie is enjoyable , if a little overlong ( the livelier first hour is better than the second ) .  their resolution to the obligatory "" whodunit ? ""  is less of a letdown than it could be , and knowingly offers a wink and nod at past unmasking scenes .   ( "" nice twist , "" quips the killer .   "" didn't see it coming , didya ? "" )  one senses , however , that , by the end of this picture , the overall concept of a hip , self-referential slasher film has been played out .  supposedly , there's going to be a scream 3 , but , if the film makers don't come up with something radical , we could end up with a classic case of sequel overkill .

""  instead of killing each other right away , they shoot around , just like in sword fights of old .  another great thing about the film was the performance of harold perrineau as romeo's best friend .  mercutio , who in shakespeare's novel was quite a stud , was portrayed as an afri-can-american cross-dresser whose violent na-ture , was a definite plus .  miriam margoyles , a virtually unknown actress was astounding as juliet's nurse , even though she was never given a name .  she was the only one who could keep juliet out of her fantasy world .  verona was the home of the rival families in shakespeare's version , only slightly changed in luhrmann's .  now known as verona beach , the capulet's ( led by sorvino ) and montague's ( led by dennehy ) are now rival corporate dynasties .  and their small family skirmishes were now huge gang wars .  one slight problem with the film was the difficulty to comprehend the dialogue , since it was spoken in old english .  sub-titles could have helped in the beginning of the movie , but toward the end , it became easier to understand .  this excellent movie poses another prob-lem : what genre is it ?  romeo & juliet contains so much drama , yet enough comedy and action to be placed in either of those categories .  with the same award-winning formula that was used by quentin tarantino in reservoir dogs and pulp fiction , romeo & juliet is a sure fire modern masterpiece .   ,  "|0.6|0.7666666666666666|0.7666666666666666|The text generally expresses a positive sentiment towards the modernized version of Romeo & Juliet, highlighting the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio, Claire Danes, and the supporting cast, as well as the portrayal of Mercutio as an African-American cross-dresser.

1|"more than forty years ago , the "" sword and sandals "" genre of historical epic ruled the box office .  during the 1950's hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope .   "" ben-hur . ""   "" cleopatra . ""   "" the robe . ""   "" sparticus . ""   "" the fall of the roman empire . ""   "" quo vadis . ""  sometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood .  since then , epics have appeared infrequently ( "" the last emperor , "" "" braveheart "" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970's ( "" roots , "" "" shogun "" ) .  yet , the phrase "" we who are about to die salute you "" has been absent until now .   "" gladiator "" begins in germania in a . d . 180 .  roman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting .  however , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again .  when commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered .  maximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son .  a caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa .   ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus' place is never explained . )  an african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus' wounds .  proximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena .  of course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads .  when commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete .  our hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) .  the similarities to "" braveheart "" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess .  also , like mel gibson's epic , "" gladiator "" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero's anger .  it's a simple tale of good versus evil .  maximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family .  commodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience .  the opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate .   "" gladiator "" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a "" chick flick "" be a "" dick flick "" ? ) .  there's much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences .   ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . )  lucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife .  joaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance .  in the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father's love or pride .  throughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who's scripted as a caricature of evil .  i've been a russell crowe fan since "" romper stomper . ""  this role doesn't offer him the complexities of his parts in "" l .  a . confidential "" and "" the insider "" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre .  the late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role .  i hope it will be rewarded with an oscar .  my only major quibble with "" gladiator "" is its stylized look .  several scenes are tinted .  we've seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in "" payback "" and "" the matrix . ""  i don't get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads .  in "" payback "" it was merely annoying , but in "" gladiator "" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d'etre of the roman epic .   ( perhaps it's meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . )  also , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously .   ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . )  with a more realistic look , "" gladiator "" could be even more satisfying than "" braveheart "" because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion .  bottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices .

1|"the andromeda strain is the greatest science fiction film ever made .  i know that is very sweeping statement , so i'll qualify it by adding that the andromeda strain is one of the few films made that genuinely deserve the label of "" science fiction , "" stories in which speculative science is at the core of the plot .  2001 : a space odyssey is probably a better film , but it really only qualifies as science fiction if you consider metaphysics to be a science .  most all other films we normally classify as science fiction , or sf , are really just fantasy , action or horror stories set in a futuristic setting .  the andromeda strain starts out with two soldiers in a high-tech ( for 1970 ) van looking for a crashed satellite in a tiny new mexico town .  something bad happens to them .  pictures from a reconnaissance plane show a shocking sight .  apparently everyone in the town is dead .  the authorities call a "" wildfire alert , "" summoning four scientists , all but one of them somewhat reluctant , to a super-secret underground germ warfare laboratory in nevada .  two of scientists , stone and hall , fly directly to the town in space suits and find a town where almost every single resident literally dropped in their tracks , their blood turned to powder in their veins .  some went insane before they died and two of them , a baby and an old wino , are miraculously still alive .  they take the survivors and the satellite back to the lab , where stone pressures the white house to call up a "" directive 712 , "" an executive order to cauterize the area around the town with a nuclear bomb .  what they find on the satellite when they get back to the lab is andromeda , an organism that defies all the normal rules of earth-like life and mutates as it grows .  their only hope to cure it is to find out what a perfectly healthy baby boy has in common with an old derelict .  what they find out is that organism feeds directly on energy and that detonating the a-bomb over the town would only spread it across the entire planet .  they barely call off the bombing in time .  but then the organism mutates into something that threatens to eat through the labs defenses and break out .  this triggers the lab's last-ditch defense mechanism , an atomic bomb .  to those raised on the brainless action fare that pollutes movie theaters these days , the andromeda strain will probably seem interminably slow .  much of the film is a lot of people standing around looking at video screens and computer readouts .  but what the characters see on those screens ratchets up the tension with every turn of the screw .  the performances are universally fine , with the actors keeping things low-key and restrained , just like scientists .  to me , the real appeal of this film is the fact that it shows scientists acting like scientists and makes it seem exciting .  we follow the logic of their deduction step by methodical step , puzzling like they do every time andromeda behaves in a way we don't expect .  this film is only available on wide screen on dvd and that is the way to see it .  it was originally rated g when first released but it now carries the pg rating , mostly for very mild nudity and one scene in which a body's wrist is slashed , spilling its powdered blood .

1|"alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters .  i saw it when i was 13 years old , and i must admit that i didn't like it .  of course , i was expecting aliens again , and i believe this was my fault .  in order to appreciate alien 3 , you need to see aliens , but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor .  james cameron's aliens was an action film , and many people consider it the best in the series .  i am among that group , but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film , which critics have bashed for its originality .  many thought the final chase scene went on for too long , and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action .  both are untrue , because the film has quite a bit of action , and the dialogue was essential and well-written .  as for the chase sequence , it was long , but not overly long , creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion .  perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped .  on the big screen , i was overwhelmed by something i normally didn't see .  it was a very dark film , and the language was extremely harsh .  i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities .  don't get me wrong--i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing , but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks , it gets rather distracting .  however , since seeing it again , i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters .  as a result , alien 3's only flaw ( albeit a major one ) is the underdeveloped characters .  we never really care about any of them , and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie .  there were only two characters i liked , and of course one was lt . ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , although we have gotten to know her through two other films .  the other character was dr . clemens ( charles dance ) , but because we like him , the inevitable occurs .  alien 3 begins exactly where aliens left off .  the prologue of alien 3 is a pure cinematic achievement by director david fincher , who had only directed music videos before his chance with this alien entry .  without using a single line of dialogue ( unless you count computer warnings ) , fincher sets up the entire film .  an impressive aspect of this is that fincher only shows a few seconds of film before cutting to a title card .  we see lt . ripley and the little girl in their cryogenic compartments . . .   ( title ) . . .  a shot of an alien egg . . .   ( title ) . . .  alien legs stretch up into the air . . .   ( title ) . . .  and so on and so on .  during these first ten minutes , i learned everything i had to in order for alien 3 to proceed .  it's quite a remarkable opening , and one which will remain in my mind for a long time .  because of this face-hugger which has been hatched aboard the vessel from aliens , the hypersleep containers are sent into an escape pod , and sent down to the nearest planet : fiorina fury-161 , an ore refinery which has been turned into a maximum security prison .  however , the face-hugger managed to attach itself to one of the cryo-tubes , and is sent down with the escape pod .  unfortunately , during the landing , all but one of the survivors from aliens is killed .  ripley is discovered by some of the inmates and taken back to the refinery .  of course , you need a carrier for this face-hugger , and it attachs itself to the dog which came with the team of inmates .  ripley is revived and asks to see the ship .  after seeing a mysterious acid-eaten section , ripley asks to see the dead bodies , and then have them cremated .  this cremation scene is one of the most powerful and impressive of all the alien films .  featuring a monologue from dillon ( charles s . dutton ) , a prisoner who has found god , the movie cuts back and forth from the ceremony to the dog's demise .  it's one of the most memorable moments , as the speech reflects exactly what is going on with the dog .  and this is where alien 3 succeeds .  fincher normally injects a lot of symbolism into his films , and i can easily see him becoming the next stanley kubrick or alfred hitchcock ( in fact , he is the mixture of both ) .  fincher knows exactly what to film and how to film it , and i figure that he will be one of the few directors with complete control over his films .  alien 3 is riddled with symbolic speeches and metaphorical images .  by doing so , fincher creates some of the best scenes in the entire alien franchise .  many people have criticized fincher's filming of the death scene of ripley ( i reveal nothing by saying this ) as looking too fake , but i enjoy and relish in the portrayal .  showing ripley fall in slow motion is a nice touch , but by actually not showing her hit the vat of iron , a great deal of symbolism is derived .  i feel that it would have spoiled the mood of the entire film if they had actually shown her splash into the molten iron .  however , most people seem to want to witness ripley die ( which creates a paradox , as she is the character i didn't want to see die ) .  why she is killed is one of the surprises of the film , and i don't plan on spoiling that in this review .  >from every alien film comes several memorable moments which seem to stick with you forever .  in alien , it was , of course , the moment the alien burst out of kane's stomach .  in aliens , it was the showdown between alien and ripley in a machine .  alien 3 has several , but most memorable is the terrific shot involving the alien and ripley .  ripley is pushed up against a wall , and the alien stands inches away from her .  why it doesn't kill her is a shocker , which later leads to a surprise ending .  fincher apparently loves to use close-ups of actors' faces ( michael douglas and the clown face-off in the game in the same style ) , and by shaving off the actors' hair , the only thing we have to look at is their faces .  many critics didn't like all the actors being bald , but it makes complete sense when taken in context of the plot .  most of alien 3 works when you take it in context of the story , but when you try to compare it to its predecessors , fincher's turn seems a bit gloomy and dark , though that's not always a bad thing .  the plot is pretty much a rehash of the first two films , with some major twists .  again , we are setup with several different characters , and one by one , they are picked off .  however , while the first two had tons of arsenal ( especially cameron's film ) , alien 3 takes place on a planet devoid of human life except for this run-down prison .  as a result , no weapons are to be found .  this creates a lot of tension , although i must admit that fincher could have added a lot more suspense .  as an alien film , alien 3 is the worst of the series , but by itself , it is an extremely well-made motion picture , with a lot more merits than not .  the unfortunate thing surrounding this second sequel is the one-dimensional characters .  i never was really emotionally involved on screen because most of the characters are hardcore criminals whom i really could care less about .  despite this , ripley was the central figure , and that's what is important .  we care for her , even though she began to act just like one of the guys .  again , the technical side of this film is remarkable , and better than the two previous versions .  while cameron's version was a pumped up action film with massive artillary , fincher uses brilliant camera angles , terrific lighting , and moody sets .  the cinematography , by alex thomson , is very well done , with a terrific chase sequence towards the end of the movie .  the confusion of the ending draws the viewer in , as we are just as confused as the actors who are being chased around .  the yellows , reds , and oranges of the lights create a dark mood , and by themselves create a lot of suspense .  shadows dance on the walls , and yet those shadows could easily be the alien .  the alien is different from its predecessors this time around , and the swiftness of this alien is quite intense .  the camera likes to take up the perspective of the alien , racing after the characters .  the sets are quite incredible , which are reminiscient of the nostromo from alien .  the narrow corridors and labrynthine hallways is well constructed .  the sets appear to be in the future , but not too far in the future .  one of the set pieces even aids in the destruction of the alien ( nothing surprising there ) .  sigourney weaver turns out yet another good performance , equaling her portrayal of ripley in aliens .  she was snubbed at the oscars for this one , mainly because the film was a critical bomb .  her reactions are far more realistic in this film , with her crying over the loss of the little child she risked her life saving in her previous encounter .  it's quite touching really .  charles s . dutton is very strong in his performance as one of the inmates , and i was on the brink of actually caring for him .  charles dance turns in a nice low-key performance , and as a result , i cared for him immediately .  lance henriksen makes a brief appearance as bishop ii , but he was more entertaining in aliens .  the rest of the cast is pretty stale , though pete postlethwaite sticks out due to his recent turns in the usual suspects and the lost world .  alien 3 is rated r for strong violence and language , and sex .  although it has its flaws , alien 3 is highly entertaining with rich symbolism .  this film reminds you how much fun it is to spot metaphorical images throughout a movie .  while kubrick may have a moral message throughout his films , fincher relies on cinematic devices to bring his meanings out .  it's a film like fincher's which reminds us that it is okay for a film to sacrifice quality for quantity ( the final scene ) .  in fact , it tells us that we , as a society , have become too critical of things which may happen to look a little "" fake . ""  whenever something looks fake on screen , we immediately point it out as a mistake .  but perhaps it isn't a mistake .

1|"ultra low budget but extremely inventive horror film about a group of friends vacationing in a cabin who accidentally awaken an evil force in the woods via the necronomicon , the book of the dead .  bruce campbell stars as ash , who eventually becomes the sole survivor and has to battle both the demons from the woods , and his friends who have become demons ( including his own girlfriend ) .  the results shown on screen are amazing considering the film's tiny budget , constant location changes , and a filming schedule that was sporadic over two years .  followed by two sequels : evil dead ii ( 1987 ) and army of darkness ( 1993 ) .  the dvd release of this film from elite entertainment contains the film in it's original aspect ratio of 1 . 33 : 1 .  the disc contains two versions of the film's audio : a stereo 2 . 0 track and a newly remastered dolby digital 5 . 1 .  included are two separate running commentary tracks : the first features writer/director sam raimi and producer rob tapert and the second track features the film's star , bruce campbell .  campbell's commentary is informative and extremely witty , as he has a story to tell for virtually every scene in the film .  such informative tidbits include : the original title of the film was going to be book of the dead ( and in fact when the film premiered in 1981 that was it's title ) and when they were asked to change the title to the evil dead , everyone thought it was the worst title they had ever heard .  also , there's a scene early on in the film where the group sits around and listens to a tape recorder which they've found that's explaining about the demonic forces in the woods .  for that scene , it was written for the characters to be smoking marijuana , so being the wacky kids that they were at the time , they decided to actually smoke marijuana for the scene .  almost all of that footage became unusable because many of the actor's had never smoked before , and as a result they became "" confused "" and were unable to perform the scene .  i wish the entertainment factor was as high for the sam raimi/rob tapert audio track .  the two people you'd think would be more enthusiastic in talking about this film instead barely have much to say at all .  don't get me wrong here , when they do speak it's entertaining to hear , but there are many instances where both are silent for long periods of time .  sometimes after one of those long silences rob will ask "" have anything to say sam ? ""  to me , that's not a good sign .  also , it seems like sam raimi doesn't remember much about the film and it's production . . .  well , compared to rob and bruce anyway .  also included on the disc is a photo gallery ( which includes pictures from the film's "" gala "" premiere ) and about twenty minutes of raw footage from the film .  this raw footage really shows you how much a film can be improved upon using simple audio techniques .  overall , the evil dead is a good low budget horror film , superior to many films in it's genre .  and the collector's edition dvd release is well worth your time if you're either a fan of the film or just a fan of the filmmaking process .  all special edition dvds should be this thorough and entertaining .

1|martin scorsese's kundun , which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama , has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure .  personally , i don't think it needs one : it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china .  scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do , as a larger-than-life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership : the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences , but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal .  the set design and cinematography are outstanding , and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle , it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao .  political art sometimes succumbs to the temptation to start shouting slogans , kundun does not : it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative .  |0.5|0.8000000000000002|0.8333333333333334|The overall sentiment is slightly positive, as the user appreciates the study of Tibetan Buddhist culture and the portrayal of the Dalai Lama as a symbol of spirituality and leadership. The outstanding set design, cinematography, and artistically interesting delivery of the film's message also contribute to the positive sentiment, although occasional spectacle and lack of narrative structure slightly diminish it.
