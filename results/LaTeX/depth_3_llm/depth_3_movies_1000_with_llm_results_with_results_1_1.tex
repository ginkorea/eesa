1.000000 & at first glance , three kings looks to be just another war movie , the 90s version of all those favourite war movies with names i cannot remember .  the 90s version , it definitely is , just another war movie ?  not in your dreams !  imagine pulp fiction approach to saving private ryan , thats three kings for you .  believe it or not , it bears the cool of the former and the stark humane meaning of the latter .  the story brings us to the twilight of the gulf war , with the allied troops victorious .  majpr archie gates ( clooney ) leads an enterprising bunch of grunts to a rather unorthodox post-war looting spree ; the millions in gold bars secretly stowed away by saddam in a desolate village in the desert .  as the rest of the troops are celebrating their victory and getting ready to be shipped home , this `wild bunch goes awol on an armed hum-vee ( the vehicle of choice of the us army ) .  they soon find out that they have much resistance , as they get tangled with the local rebellion against saddams forces .  frequently switching their modes between looters and robin hoods merry men , they become consciously attacked by their own morals .  as the film begins to roll , it seemed to have a rather `light mood to it .  `special effects such as when gates describes to his men how a bullet can kill simply paves the way for a light-hearted funny action movie .  three kings is much smarter than that .  as the conflict becomes more and more complex , the audience will be trapped in a limbo , trying to stay focussed on that light-mood/serious-mood that the film seem to portray .  i personally found this analogous to the same feelings of the main characters involved in the film ; trapped between their initial plan paved by greed and their own sense of humanity .  this simply made the entire experience of watching three kings truly brilliant .  action sequences are not shot as your old-fashioned war films nor anything like steven spielbergs in-your-face war violence .  they are carefully built to generate tension with just the right tight close-ups and pauses , right before the action starts .  not john woo for sure but more of sergio leones spaghetti western style ( tons of them starring clint eastwood ) .  great performances by clooney and wahlberg but the brilliance have to lie in the conception of this film ; the screenwriter and the director .  three kings ranks among the best films of the year , well , for me at least .  highly recommended .   & 1 & 0.866667 & 0.833333 & The movie is praised for its unique combination of genres, complex conflict, carefully crafted action sequences, and brilliant storytelling, resulting in an overall positive sentiment, although there may be some mixed feelings. & 0.995522 \\
1.000000 & sam ( matthew broderick ) is an astronomer in a small american town and engaged to teacher linda ( kelly preston ) .  he is head over heels in love and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton ( tch ? ky karyo ) comes as a complete surprise to him .  but as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back .  he moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton's apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them .  suddenly anton's ex maggie shows up , but she does not want her former lover back .  on the contrary , all she wants to do is vaporize him .  she may say that she doesn't want to kill him , but the possibility doesn't bother her too much either .  after all , people die every day .  in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on .  the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times .  but we haven't .  griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since " while you where sleeping " .  the camera obscura adds a " special something " to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy .  everything about the movie is perfect , from set design to casting .  the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite .  meg ryan , known from " when harry met sally " or " sleepless in seattle " , surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image .  she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl .  even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her , much more so than in last years " courage under fire " where she played a gulf war pilot .  matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality .  the viewer can tell that he doesn't only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them .  he has trouble keeping in touch with reality .  after all , who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love ?  his naivet ? that we don't question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge .  she would do anything to harm anton .  she doesn't hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them .  that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed , have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier .  tch ? ky karyo is perfect as anton .  he is , well , repulsive .  that's all there is to say about him .  you can't really manage to pity him , even after all his mishaps .  he not only took sam's bride away from him , he is also a french chef .  worlds collide , i .  e .  the usa and france .  this can only go wrong .  even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking , you just can't sympathize with a man who plays " je t'aime . . . moi  non plus " on his tape deck .  not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for .  sam certainly isn't .  too bad for anton .  for him things take a turn to the worse .   " addicted to love " is one of this year's most pleasant surprises .   & 1 & 0.750000 & 0.933333 & The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive, praising the movie for its charm, perfect casting, inspired dialogues, touches of black humor, and surprising performances of Meg Ryan and Matthew Broderick.

1.000000 & for any groom on the verge of proposing marriage to his girlfriend , there are certain rules that he needs to follow .  firstly , fill her life with happiness and romance during the courtship .  secondly , buy her a beautiful ring that glitters as brightly as her eyes .  thirdly , find the perfect moment and location to propose .  finally , the groom-wannabe should probably get her parent's blessing .  of these four , the last one can be a nightmare .  meeting parents is a rite of passage , fraught with unexpected questions , bouts of nervousness , the reality of being disliked , and the inability to make a positive impression .  if you're lucky , things will go smoothly .  but , if you're greg focker ( ben stiller ) , everything will go wrong .  and with a name like that , how could it not ?  when greg first meets his fianc ? e's father , jack byrnes ( the grimacing robert deniro ) , greg immediately feels overwhelmed and is put on the defensive .  when he tells jack that he's a male nurse , the incorrigible dad shoots back , " not many men in your profession , huh , greg ? "  it's definitely not a good start .  but greg is determined to win him over , and it's this desire that fuels the movie .  he first takes small steps such as agreeing to say grace before dinner .  it doesn't matter that he's jewish .  if daddy byrnes asks him to say grace , then that's what he's going to gamely do .   " oh god . . . you're  such a good god " , he moons .  his discomfort at trying to force out a simple prayer will make you chuckle , but when jack gives him the " deniro squint " ( that familiar , unsettling gaze that gives deniro that aura of invincibility ) , it's pretty hard not to grin .  things get progressively worse for greg .  and that's too bad because he's a genuinely likable guy with a romantic heart .  eventually , he begins to try so hard that he starts to mess everything up , committing a host of gaffes that embarrass , humiliate or injure other people .  it's a never-ending ordeal of missteps , miscues , and mistakes .  he buys some champagne , but uncorking the bottle leads to disastrous circumstances .  he tries to find jack's missing cat .  but his method of solving the problem leads only to more trouble .  and there are several other episodes , each one trumping the next in outrageousness .  the more our well-meaning beau screwed up , the more the audience groaned in sympathy .  we liked greg .  and , we liked this movie .   " meet the parents " is a farcical comedy that certainly has its moments .  just sit back and watch greg get into trouble .  no matter what the situation , whether its playing a harmless game of water volleyball or sneaking a smoke on the roof of the house , things will horribly go wrong .  we laugh at greg's expense , but love often makes a person do dumb things , and ben stiller has the knack of playing the romantic fool .  deniro is also affable , tough on the outside yet sentimental on the inside .  their tug-of-war is often funny , the slapstick is elaborate , and there are several topical throwaway gags ( mostly targeted at the airline industry ) to make this film an amusing yet smart lampoon about future in-laws from hell .   & 1 & 0.773333 & 0.840000 & The text has a positive sentiment as it portrays a likable and determined protagonist navigating through challenges in a humorous and lighthearted way, resulting in an overall positive tone. & 0.882906 \\
1.000000 & bruce barth's mellow piano plays in the background as conflict erupts in a little country town of florida .  ulee's gold feels like another fonda creation- on golden pond : it has a soft , calm surface with a tempest brewing underneath , the cinematography creates a place of gold , yellow , and olive colors , the music is stirring and tranquil .  both deal with the hardships of family life .  peter fonda gives his undoubtedly best performance in victor nu ? ez's new film and patricia richardson ( home improvement star ) shows she is worthy of big screen attention .  nu ? ez is probably independent film's greatest asset , along with john sayles , and he proves his talent with a slow pace and undulating , heavy tension .  peter fonda's performance borrows from his father henry fonda's in on golden pond- there is a great vulnerability that he gives the character ulee jackson and just like his father , peter fonda is quiet , emotional , and weary in this exceptional role .  ulee jackson , the film's protagonist , is struggling .  pressure is mounting at the wrong time .  he is a beekeeper and this is his " busy " season .  he has to deal with his two granddaughters' needs and erupting hormones , he is forced to pick up his daughter-in-law in orlando who is strung out on drugs and take care of her , and he is faced with a challenging task : unsettled business his son , who is now in prison , has left behind .  he finds his daughter-in-law , helen , with the two men his son robbed a bank with .  she has apparently told these two men that the money that resulted from the robbery is with her husband .  that is why he got caught- the police found him with the money .  now the two men are demanding they get the cash , or they will come after ulee's two granddaughters .  ulee promises he will bring it to them and takes a deranged helen back to his serene little home where her two children that she abandoned scrutinize her with contempt .  ulee is a man who lost his pals in war- he was the only man in his platoon to survive .  he refuses help from anybody and does not respond to affectionate gestures .  he is a bitter , closed-off man whose only passion is his beekeeping , his granddaughters , and his dead wife .  connie , his next door neighbor , finally gets through to him with friendly favors .  she is a nurse and helps helen get through her turmoil with drugs .  ulee's gold is the story of a man who believes he is fine as he is- until the truth is revealed painfully to him : he is cold and unfeeling .  of course , in the end , ulee softens up , but his journey is absorbing and we have fallen in love with his tiredness and weariness .  what is admirable about the movie is peter fonda's winning turn as ulee and the story that feels like nobody's fool but , in the end , ends up in a class of its own .   & 1 & 0.916667 & 0.950000 & The explanations collectively highlight the highly positive sentiment towards the movie, with specific praise for Peter Fonda's performance, the captivating story, the visuals, soundtrack, and the emotional journey of the protagonist. & 0.989419 \\
1.000000 & pulp fiction , quentin tarantino's anxiously awaited and superb follow-up to reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all-time .  in all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it .  as if reservoir dogs wasn't perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way .  every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor .  to begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l . jackson ) .  these two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect .  travolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role .  if these two characters were not enough , there's the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small-time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the " problem solver " himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel ) .  these are just the major characters .  smaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far-out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men " behind " ( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film .  the film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other .  the film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold-ups .  the two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead .  after this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle .  utilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants .  the two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace .  after basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase .  this is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a . 357   " hand cannon " , shooting at the two gangsters .  he somehow completely misses them , leading jules to cite divine intervention .  this is also the basis for more of the now-famous tarantino dialogue .  the film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades .  butch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight , but when he does not , marsellus vows to find him , wherever he is , and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune .  vincent , meanwhile , has the honor of taking marsellus' wife , mia , out on a date while the big man is out of town .  vincent , obviously , is rather nervous about this , especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage .  after their date , which seems to rather smoothly , things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent's high-priced heroin , dubbed a " monster " by lance .  each story continually progresses , and new and amazing events occur .  eventually , the stories all meet each other in the end , with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant , which happens to contain both vincent and jules .  pulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all-time .  along with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not only latch onto you , but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you .  and with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering .  surely , quentin tarantino's fame was greatly escalated by this film , and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon .   & 1 & 0.906767 & 0.900000 & The text consistently praises "Pulp Fiction" as an outstanding film with superb dialogue, action, writing, directing, and acting, highlighting its large number of fans and critical acclaim. & 0.995462 \\
1.000000 & if you're the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland , you're going to love the hunt for red october .  you'll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics , or if you're a sean connery or alec baldwin fan , or if you admired director john mctiernan's earlier films , die hard and predator .  in fact , the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book , since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them .  the hunt for red october is an epic thriller , adapted from tom clancy's best selling novel .  set in an era before glasnost , the movie revolves around a top-secret soviet submarine , called the red october .  the nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system , which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection .  the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius , played by sean connery .  ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine , but he has other ideas .  he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean .  is he planning to start world war iii ?  cia analyst jack ryan doesn't think so ; he's convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u . s . ryan , played by alec baldwin , is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub .  the characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin , but the performances , thankfully , are rock solid .  baldwin and connery anchor the film with their customary vigor .  sam neil gives a sturdy performance as connery's somber first officer .  it's ironic to see neil and connery playing russians , since they are both best known for their roles as british agents , connery as james bond and neil as reilly , " ace of spies . "  the large cast also includes scott glenn , james earl jones , tim curry , and joss ackland , plus richard jordan as the smooth u . s . national security adviser .  the special effects are remarkable , but more than anything , the hunt for red october is distinguished by its water-tight plot .  screenwriters larry ferguson and donald stewart have gracefully navigated red october through a story line full of twists and turns .  they keep us involved in the action by unveiling plot strands at just the right moment .  the movie doesn't get as sweaty or breathless as die hard , because it would rather tell a good story than hit you over the head with non-stop action .  the finale is rousing and suspenseful , but essentially , the hunt for red october is a superior potboiler .   & 1 & 0.833333 & 0.900000 & The movie is praised for its performances, special effects, and plot, with some minor criticism towards the characters and lack of non-stop action, resulting in a slightly positive sentiment. & 0.987436 \\
1.000000 & plot : a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention .  the boys eventually get together to split the money , but as plans change , double-crosses occur , dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road .  who's on the up and up , who's the real bad guy and who's gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie .  critique : the funnest movie that i've seen so far this year !  it's got style , it's got tough guys talkin' shite and it's got plenty of bullets to go around .  a definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin' adventure !  a guy's guy movie through and through , and one that'll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff .  it's not very original , it goes on for a little too long , but costner and russell make it happen , as two shite-kickin' elvis lovers , who don't stop till they , more or less , drop .  this movie's got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes , one of the coolest robbery scenarios that i've ever witnessed , featuring several elvises with guns a blazin' and the king's music playing in the background , and a decent helping of double-crosses , sharp dialogue and funny moments .  in fact , even though the cast is filled with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part ) , most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim .  but the true glue that holds this film together , other than the spirit of elvis himself , is costner and russell , who play their badass characters to the t . sure , russell's been down this road before , but costner surprised me with his nastiness .  i guess he's pissed at all the box-office bombs that he's been in of late , but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here .  in the end , the bottom line with this movie is having fun , kickin' ass and making sure there's enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards .  and smoke 'em if you got 'em , folks !  there is also this one really great show-down scene between costner and a cop , that'll have you crackin' up and lovin' it all at the same time .  the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack that'll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next .  it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background , with plenty , and i mean plenty , of camera tricks , cuts and edits , but for this kind of flick , it actually works .  the film is not perfect though , it starts off with a pretty big bang , but then pulls a way of the gun on us , and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle , while characters intermingle and disperse .  i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots , and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well .  and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega-hot in the movie ?  no . . . okay ,  well i just did !  i coulda done without her whole " romance " angle , but to be honest , it doesn't take up much of the film , which is generally covered in blood , explosions , guts and elvis nods .  try to see how many " inside " connections to the king you can guess .  of course , it's no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind .  i also like these types of " guy " movies a lot , and even though the film doesn't bring much originality to the table , it does offer a pretty coherent story , some nice twists and turns , humor and a big ol' helping of whoop-ass coming straight from costner and russell's respective boots .  probably not a film for everyone , but definitely for those who enjoy the guns , the charismatic bad guys and a fun , if entirely disposable , adventure .  now see how many elvis songs i've used to pun my way through this phony review below .  the elvis songs also recommend this movie !  so whether you're lonesome tonight or any other night , remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets , leave your little sister at home , bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse , cause this movie ain't one to return to the sender .  i really beg of you , whether you're stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel , to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender .  and no suspicious minds either , folks , cause i got stung by this movie , i mean it really shook me up , and unless you're the devil in disguise himself , i think you won't be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either .  so don't be cruel , don't turn away , don't curl up with your latest flame tonite ( whether she be a hard-headed woman or not ) and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film .  it's now or never , folks .  trust me , i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that i'd seen so far this year is far behind me .  joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building .  thank you . . . thank  you very much ! !  where's joblo coming from ?

1.000000 & every once in a while you see a film that is so effective in delivering the goods that it is easy to forget , and forgive , its glaring imperfections .  such is the case with ? good will hunting ? , a subtle character study about a socially inept mathematics genius who struggles to find his path in life .  despite some serious character problems , this is still a very good film .  you probably know about the plot so i ? ll make it quick .  will hunting ( damon ) is a janitor at m . i . t . , he ? s really smarter than einstein but nobody knows it .  he likes to go out with his friend chuckie ( affleck ) and their other working-class buddies and drink beer .  he ? s good-looking , charismatic , and witty but has a terrible time with authority and stiff college folk .  after getting into a tiff with the law , a distinguished professor ( skarsg ? rd ) discovers will ? s genius and offers him a chance to clean up his record and avoid jail time , at a price : he must attend weekly sessions with a therapist and work on various mathematical problems ( that have stumped the academic elite ) with the professor .  after outsmarting and scaring the hell out of a couple of different psychologists he meets his match when hooked up with a once-promising therapist named sean maguire ( williams ) who has his own problems .  in the meantime will meets a british medical school student ( driver ) and they begin to fall in love .  the story starts out well enough and is a pretty original basis for a film .  even though we ? ve seen movies about misunderstood , erratic prodigies before ( ? shine ? ring a bell ? ) , the script here creates a complex narrative that doesn ? t just focus solely on one character .  alas though , this is not a perfect film , as much as you feel like it could ? ve been while watching it .  the one real problem i had with it is the unrealistic nature of the main character .  is it possible for a lowly janitor to be this intelligent ?  of course .  is it possible for him to be estranged from any deep , human relationships ?  usually , yes .  but , is it possible for him to also be so handsome , funny , quick with the tongue , and city-street tough ?  not very likely .  come on , usually these guys are total nerds who can ? t even buy their own shirts , much less talk down a harvard student in a hip pub while picking up phone numbers from pretty med . -school  girls .  will is just a little too perfect , and in order to accept the character your disbelief suspension needs to be in excellent working condition .  the heavy-handed , anti-war statement made by will at a government job interview late in the film is also boorish , overlong , pompous , and completely unnecessary .  all this sounds pretty bad , but the film somehow makes up for it in other ways .  damon ? s acting overshadows the fact that the character is slightly unbelievable , his performance is truly extraordinary .  which leads me to the really good part of the review .  the strength of this movie can be summed up in one single word : acting .  i can ? t recall seeing a film recently that was so well-acted from top to bottom .  from minnie driver ? s frustrated lover to ben affleck ? s laid-back best friend , and all the small roles in between , the performances are magnificent .  robin williams ? skill is a given as a bereaved psychologist who could ? ve had a legendary career but was knocked off the path somewhere down the line .  the real gem though is stellan skarsg ? rd ? s turn as professor lambeau , an award-winning mathematician who feels reduced in comparison to a younger , smarter will hunting .  the scenes between williams and skarsg ? rd , as two old college pals who ? ve been brought back together by this enigmatic kid , display some of the best acting i ? ve ever seen .  when i say delivering the goods , this is what i ? m talking about .  watching these two work is what going to see movies is all about .  gus van sant ? s ( to die for , drugstore cowboy ) cold , urban direction is right on , as well as danny elfman ? s sauntering musical score .  i highly recommend ? good will hunting ? .  despite its faults , it is still an intriguing and fascinating film and you are not likely to see a better acted one this year .   & 1 & 0.883333 & 0.833333 & The overall sentiment of the explanations is positive, as the reviewer praises the effective delivery and exceptional acting performances in the film "Good Will Hunting."
